That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

            "text": "The Records of the Company under Sir Thomas Smith\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AS IN 1606\n\nIn the year preceding the grant of a charter to the Virginia Company there had been movements along two lines for establishing plantations in Virginia, one by private investment and the other by royal patronage. Examples of the private interests are the enterprise of the Earl of Southampton in 1605 and that of Lord Zouch as set forth in his contract with Captain George Waymouth of October 30, 1605. In this Lord Zouch agreed to secure and provide two ships and 200 men of \u201carts suitable for a colony,\u201d and to pay \u00a3100 to Captain Waymouth for the transportation of the same. The interesting feature is the agreement, suggestive of feudal relations, that Lord Zouch should be the first officer and have the first choice of land, while Captain Waymouth as second officer should have second choice of land, which he was to hold from the former as lord paramount for himself, his heirs and assigns. At the same time Sir John Popham was busily engaged in the attempt to form royal colonies by obtaining charters from the Crown, whereby the territory from 34\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude should be taken under the protection of the King, and private settlements should thus be excluded. The plan which obtained followed neither course, though it was bound to result in a modification of Popham\u2019s scheme. The motives of the grantees and the arguments which induced the King in 1606 to abandon the policy of Elizabeth and to give royal patronage to the undertaking, and even to assume royal control, are set forth in a petition presented to Parliament in 1606, entitled \u201cReasons for raising a publique stocke to be imploied in the discovering of such countries as may be found most convenient.\u201d It is evident, however, that the unknown plan of investment in the adventure of 1606 is not here suggested, since there was no intimation of financial support by the King. The stock was apparently to be raised by a tax \u201cUpon the moderate gaines of those that contrary to lawe abuse the poore,\u201d and was not in any way to be \u201craised upon the sweat of the poore or the industrie of the poore.\u201d",

To the Kingdom and to the Crown were to redound the greatest gain. Ten thousand pounds a year were to be added to His Majesty\u2019s receipts by an increase of many thousand pounds in the imposts and customs; and furthermore it \u201cwould savour too much of affectation of a popular State to levie monies without imparting some convenient portion to his Majestie.\u201d But the value to shipping was emphasized perhaps more vigorously as developing a defence to the island, as furnishing a source for the necessities for ships\u2014cordage, pitch, tar, and resin\u2014and as protecting the shipping from decay. The desirability of a revival of the declining export trade, as well as that of establishing the importation of necessities from a part of the dominions, though distant, was urged, together with the importance of strengthening by settlement those countries already acquired by discovery. That such undertakings by private enterprise had been failures; that it was more honorable for the State to back an exploitation by public consent than by private monopoly; that public colonies were bound to be more obedient and industrious because of the greater confidence in the character of the control, were all reasons which had long before been set forth whereby to gain the support of the Crown.  \nCHARTER OF 1606.  \nThe royal aid as finally obtained for a colonial enterprise came in a somewhat different form. The letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates and others for plantations to be made in Virginia show that the investment was made solely by individuals, and that the joint stock was not public, although in the regulation of affairs in the colony the body of undertakers was to have little influence, even as far as its commercial interests in the plantation were concerned. The business management was left to the joint stock companies, and the magazine was controlled by a treasurer or cape merchant and by two clerks elected by the President and Council in the Colony. In fact, the only activity of the adventurers, so far as it is revealed in the extant documents, consisted in the choice in London of one or more groups of agents, called \u201ccompanies,\u201d to manage the goods sent out and received and to look after the profits. The undertakers were to have all lands with their resources.  \na For a reprint of the letters patent, see Brown, Genesis, I, 52-62, or Poore\u2019s Constitutions.  \nb Articles, Instructions and Orders for the government of the Colonies, November 20, 1606.

The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group.

The right freely to transport subjects was granted the investors, while they were permitted customs free for seven years to export armor, provisions, and all necessities of life for the colonists. They could impose upon any subjects of the Crown, who were not adventurers, trafficking in those regions, a tax of 24 per cent of the articles concerned, and upon foreigners twice that amount, and thus maintain a control of the trade for twenty-one years. But the government of the colonies and of the territory of Virginia was reserved to the Crown through the council of thirteen for Virginia, which was to be appointed by the King and to reside in England. Instructions were issued and signed by the royal hand, which outlined the form of administering affairs in the settlement and created a council of thirteen in the colony. They conferred upon it the right to coin money and to pass ordinances which should be valid till altered by the Crown, provided that they should be consonant with the laws of England. This council in Virginia was to choose its own president for one year. It could remove him or any member for just cause and fill the vacancies. All civil causes and all lesser criminal cases were to be decided by the president and council, the former having two votes in case of a tie. Cases of manslaughter and the more heinous crimes were to be tried before a jury and were punishable with death. To the president and council was reserved the right of pardon. The council in England nominated to the Crown the persons to whom lands were to be granted by the King. It had, in fact, the supervision of affairs, appointed the first council in Virginia, issued orders for the conduct of the first expedition under Captain Newport, and provided a paper of advice as to the establishment of a fort and of a town. It is in this latter document that the first indication of the real motive of the undertaking is found. The orders laid down were to \u201cmake choice\u201d of the river \u201cwhich bendeth most toward the North-West, for that way you shall soonest find the other sea,\u201d while the choice of a healthy location, wise intercourse with the natives, and the fortification and preparation of a single settlement were emphasized. The chief objects, however, were to plant in a place. \n\nPrinted in full, Brown, Genesis, I, 64-75. See Certain Orders and Directions, December 10, 1606.

The loss of the records, both of the council and of the \"companies\" for trade, covering this period, leaves, as the only source of information, both for affairs in England and in Virginia, the narratives of the early settlers. Of these the most important are the reports of Captain Newport, and the relations of John Smith, of Edward Maria Wingfield, and of George Percy.* The council had dispatched three expeditions, all under Captain Newport; one in December, 1606, in three ships with 120 emigrants; another in October, 1607, with two vessels and about the same number of passengers; and a third in August of 1608 with about 70 emigrants. The reports of Newport, Percy, Wingfield, and Smith encouraged the managers of the enterprise to continue their efforts, but proved that a change in object as well as in policy would be necessary. From Newport came descriptions of the fruitful- ness of the soil, of the quantities of fish and of timber, and of clay for making brick, and enumerations of the possible exports, comprising sturgeon, clapboard, wainscot, saxafrage, tobacco, dyes, furs, pitch, resin, turpentine, oils, wines, wood and soap ashes, iron, copper, pearls; but the reports as to the mines were vague. He declared that the country was rich in gold and copper, and took home with him earth to be assayed, while Smith, in A True Relation, states that he had been left to dig a rock which Captain Newport thought was a mine, but no mention of results is made. The full description of the country by Newport and also by Captain John Smith gave the council a clear idea of its geography, as is indicated by the instructions to Sir Thomas Gates in 1609. But the expedition, which penetrated to a distance of 160 miles up the river, brought the explorers to hostile tribes and left the council still uncertain, though hopeful of the discovery of a passage to the south sea. Furthermore, Captain Newport positively stated that there could be no commerce with the Indians, and all evidence shows that the natives were to be a resource for the necessities of life rather than for the exchange of lucrative objects of trade. Hence it is that the broadside which was issued by the company in 1609, as an incident of its *See John Smith, A True Relation, 1608, reprinted in Arber, Works of John Smith, 1884; Discourse of Virginia, by Edward Maria Wingfield, printed in the Archaeologia Americana, IV, 77-103; Observations gathered out of a Discourse of the Plantation in Virginia 1606, by George Percy, printed in Brown, Genesis, I, 152-168; and the following documents probably written by Captain Archer: A Relation of the Discovery of Our River, from James Forte into the maine: by Capt.

This book, covering the period from the 28th of January, 1606, to the 14th of February, 1615, was in the possession of the company as late as 1623, but unfortunately no trace of the book has yet been discovered and even its existence has heretofore been unknown. Whatever may have been the source of control, the narrations of Captain Percy, Edward-Maria Wingfield, and Captain Newport indicate that the business of the company consisted chiefly in raising funds and equipping expeditions to be sent to Virginia under Captain Newport. This failure of the investment to bring in returns of gold and silver and of articles for trade, or to accomplish anything in the way of discovery of trade routes to the East Indies during the first three years, served to convince both King and undertakers that a change in method of control was essential. The document known as \u201cReasons against publishing the Kings title to Virginia. A justification for planting Virginia\u201d seems to show an agitation among the investors arising from fear lest the desire to placate Spain, or religious considerations, might lead the Crown to abandon the scheme. The arguments there adduced may well explain the readiness of the King to surrender not only the commercial and territorial control but also full rights of government to the corporate body of the Virginia company, and thus to avoid any rupture with Spain. Certain it is that the desire for more direct authority and for securing larger investments were the motives of the petitioners in asking for a new charter. As a result of this movement the letters patent of 1609 were issued, transforming the undertakers into a body politic. In this case also the documents are especially characteristic of the organization. Whereas the Crown was formerly the source of all power, beginning with 1609 the council of the company, acting as a standing committee for the adventurers rather than in the name of the King, exercised the controlling authority. After the charter of 1612 had provided for more frequent meetings of the generality, the council was gradually superseded by special committees and the tendency arose to decide all matters of importance in the general quarter courts and to insist upon all communications being addressed to the company rather than to the council. The act of incorporation erected a commercial company and made it the overlord of a proprietary province. It at once strengthened its plantation as a center for traffic and established a system for joint management of land and trade to extend over a period of seven years.  \n\u201cWhen the Privy Council demanded the records of the company, a receipt bearing the date April 21, 1623, was given to the secretary of the company for the \u2018several court books.\u2019 This document was discovered by the Editor among the Ferrar papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, in December, 1903. See List of Records, p. 171, No. 470. This document was recently found by the Editor in the Bodleian Library. Jbid., p. 121, No. 1.",

            "text": "UNDER SIR THOMAS SMYTHE 25 pelled against its will to submit to the treatment of its plantation as a penal colony by James I in his spasmodic efforts to develop a policy which should save England from an overpopulation of vagabonds.* With the exception of these unimportant relations with the Crown, the company seems to have conducted its business independently of royal aid or interference during the first decade of its existence as a corporate body. \n\nII.\u2014THE COURT BOOK It is therefore in the court book of the company and in its instructions, correspondence, and other records suggested under the preceding classifications II and III, that its activity and methods must be found. That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229-230, n. >This receipt covered these four volumes, \u201cthe other perticuler writings belonging to the company,\u201d and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th. Smithes tyme\u201d; the second was a \u201cparticular already delivered to the Com.\u201d in which appeared the \u201cStaple Commodities raysed in Sr. T. Smithes tyme\u201d; while the third formed a \u201ccollect of the publick workes made by Sr. Sa. Argall when he commenced\u201d and was entitled \u201cThe particulars of the Boates.\u201d Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states \u201cThere is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121-131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M.

However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress\u2014the fourth volume here mentioned\u2014was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company.",

Even our knowledge as to the economic condition of the colony is most indefinite and comes only from printed pamphlets issued by the company. Judging from the sources of information in the later period, this uncertainty is due to the disappearance of the letters themselves, since, after 1619, the published relations of individual planters, the declarations by the company, and even the records of the court books are all more general in character than the letters which were sent from the colony to the company. Furthermore, in the later period the daily acts of the colonists and their needs, as reported from time to time by returning ships, afforded the adventurers a body of information concerning the social condition of the colony which in form and accuracy left little to be desired. After the time of Captain John Smith not much was accurately known of the colony until the year 1617, when Captain John Rolfe and Ralph Hamor supplied statistics as to the numbers, condition, settlements, and resources of the colony as it then was. The individual enterprises of this decade in the life of the company are altogether unknown, except from a few contracts for shipping found here and there. Such movements must at least have been noted in the court book. Of the first \u201chundred,\u201d established in 1618, nothing is recorded except the single report, heretofore unknown, of a meeting of the committee for Smythes Hundred. But the greatest loss which we suffer through the disappearance of the court book is that of material which should throw light on the aims, motives, and unsuccessful efforts of the company and on the struggles and difficulties through which it passed. For example, there is a single reference to an attempt to found a college, but no information whatever on the subject. The factions which developed and which resulted finally in the dissolution of the company evidently existed in this period, for a letter from Chamberlain to Carleton, dated May 8, 1619, in which he speaks of the failure to reelect Sir Thomas Smythe as treasurer of the Virginia Company as having been \u201csomewhat bettered at a later meeting of the Summers Island Company by his choice as treasurer of that company,\u201d proves that the change was due to factional differences, although the extant court books open with the refusal of Sir Thomas Smythe to continue as treasurer.

            "text": "28 INTRODUCTION  \nthe petitions to the company and its action thereupon, and numerous other acts, revealing the relations and attitude of the individual members, are all unknown.*  \n\nIII.\u2014 DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY  \nOf the official documents issued by the company during the decade from 1609 to 1619 the most important have been unknown up to this time. They include the first instructions ever given to a governor of a colony by an English administrative body, and the records of the first suits entered by the company in chancery for the purpose of enforcing the payments of sums adventured in the company and of securing a part of the income from the lottery, which the company claimed had been withheld by the agent, William Leveson.?  \n\nThe knowledge which the administrators of the affairs of the company had gained from the early settlers, and their grasp of the necessities for exploration, for trade, and for the conduct of affairs in the plantation, has hitherto been a matter of surmise based on the relations of the planters. From the \u201cInstructions, orders, and constitutions to Sir Thomas Gates,\u201d \u00b0 in May, 1609, and a similar document given to \u2018Sir Thos. West Knight Lo: Lawarr\u201d? in 1609 or 1610 comes a revelation of the motives of the adventurers, as well as of the policy adopted and of the methods outlined for the prosecution of their efforts.  \n\nThese instructions to Gates and De La Warr afforded the authority for the termination of the previous government in Virginia, the stated ideas of the company as to locations for settlements, forts, and magazines, and concerning journeys inland. It also included an interesting reference to Raleigh\u2019s colonists. The general policy in administering the affairs of the colonists and the detailed orders as to the relations with the Indians, as far as they concern guards, trade, and treaties, and the daily life of the inhabitants, indicate a definiteness in the control of the company which formerly was not understood.  \n\nIn such a revelation of the knowledge of the country and of the natives there is a scattering information of such a character concerning this period appears in the discussions and quarrels recorded in the later court books.  \n\n> List of Records, pp. 123-124, Nos. 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31.  \n\nThere are three cases recorded in the chancery proceedings in which the company attempted to enforce the payment of adventured sums. The bill of complaint is identical in each case, with the exception of the names of the defendant and the sums they underwrote. The bill, dated April 28, 1613, against Sir Henry Nevile, Sir Henry Carye, and eighteen others is printed in Brown\u2019s Genesis of the United States, I, pp. 623-631, from a copy found among the Smyth of Nibley papers. It differs slightly in orthography only from the original record.  \n\nThe five recorded answers supply even more valuable information than the bills of complaints.  \n\n>This manuscript is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Ashmolean Manuscripts, 1147, folios 175-190\".

The company had become convinced that the policy of John Smith was a wise one, and hence it ordered that a number of plantations should be settled and that efforts should be immediately directed to building healthful and sufficient houses and to planting widely enough for the self-support of the community. Here was the germ which was to develop into the colony, but the plan was as yet by no means so far-reaching. A common store, a common magazine, common refectories, labor by groups with a superintendent for each five or six persons, the prohibition of trade with the Indians except through the truck merchant were economic methods which looked to the gain of the adventurer in London rather than to the development of a colonial settlement. When the settlers had become self-supporting and capable of defense, then measures were to be taken to provide returns, so \u201cthat our fleetes come not home empty.\u201d Discovery of the seas and of royal mines, exchange of commodities, the exaction of tribute, and the development of the resources of the country for the purpose of securing \u201cwines, pitche, Tarre, sope-ashes, Steele, Iron, Pipestaues, hempe, flaxe,\u201d silk grass, fishing for pearls, cod, and sturgeon were to be the sources of revenue. The instructions placed authority implicitly in the hands of the governor, who was expected to hear, but not necessarily to heed, the advice of the council and to judge according to \u201cnaturall right and equity then vppon the nicenes of the lawe.\u201d The agents of the corporation\u2014the governor and his council in Virginia\u2014received their authorization for the exercise of judicial as well as legislative powers through a commission. The one issued to Sir Thomas Gates is lost, but doubtless is as similar to that given to Lord La Warr as are his instructions. With the exception of a set of \u201cInstructions for such things as are to be sente from Virginia, 1610,\u201d these orders and commissions are the only documents which show anything of the direct authority exercised by the company over affairs in the plantation until the issue of the \u201cGreat Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes\u201d in November, 1618. Otherwise, the whole course of the activity of the company under Sir Thomas Smythe was in strong contrast with the work of Sir Edwin Sandys. It was a care on the part of the company is also seen in the general instructions of 1609 to the lieutenant-governor of Virginia, which are known only through a copy of the sixth article, preserved in the papers of the Marquis of Lansdowne. The commission bears the date February 28, 1610. It is printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 376-384. Printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 384-386. This set of instructions to Governor George Yeardley, although given late in 1618, belongs both in spirit and effect to the period of the Sandys-Southampton administration.",

In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1) Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2) Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3) A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation. London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4) Nevves from Virginia\u2014a poem. 1610. (5) A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610. (6) De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw\u2019s Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7) The New life of Virginea\u2014second part of Nova Britannia, by the Counsell of Virginea. London, May 1, 1612. (8) Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9) A booke called an Narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear arguments.\n\n@ Brown, Genesis, I, 774-779, 797-799. > Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312-316; (4) 360-373.

In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1) Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2) Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3) A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation. London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4) Nevves from Virginia\u2014a poem. 1610. (5) A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610. (6) De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw\u2019s Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7) The New life of Virginea\u2014second part of Nova Britannia, by the Counsell of Virginea. London, May 1, 1612. (8) Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9) A booke called an Narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear arguments.\n\n@ Brown, Genesis, I, 774-779, 797-799. > Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312-316; (4) 360-373.

In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1) Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2) Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3) A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation. London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4) Nevves from Virginia\u2014a poem. 1610. (5) A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610. (6) De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw\u2019s Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7) The New life of Virginea\u2014second part of Nova Britannia, by the Counsell of Virginea. London, May 1, 1612. (8) Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9) A booke called an Narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear arguments.\n\n@ Brown, Genesis, I, 774-779, 797-799. > Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312-316; (4) 360-373.

In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1) Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2) Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3) A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation. London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4) Nevves from Virginia\u2014a poem. 1610. (5) A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610. (6) De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw\u2019s Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7) The New life of Virginea\u2014second part of Nova Britannia, by the Counsell of Virginea. London, May 1, 1612. (8) Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9) A booke called an Narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear arguments.\n\n@ Brown, Genesis, I, 774-779, 797-799. > Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312-316; (4) 360-373.

            "text": "32 INTRODUCTION\n\nturers, declaring the intention to send a new governor and surveyours to the colony for the purpose, while that of the winter of the same year announces that any settlers may return to England who will. In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1) Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2) Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3) A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation. London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4) Nevves from Virginia\u2014a poem. 1610. (5) A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the Councell of Virginia. London, 1610. (6) De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw\u2019s Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7) The New life of Virginea\u2014second part of Nova Britannia, by the Counsell of Virginea. London, May 1, 1612. (8) Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9) A booke called an Narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear arguments.\n\n@ Brown, Genesis, I, 774-779, 797-799. > Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312-316; (4) 360-373. A fourth sermon preached by Richard Crakanthorpe, March 24, 1608/9, on the anniversary of the accession of James I, has favorable references to the project. See Brown, Genesis, I, 255-256. \u00a2 Brown either reprints all of these or cites the reference.

Then, too, the first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610-1612, martial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the company now proposed; the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a minimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and the produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early settlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall, like Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the Indians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted in the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south, which became self-supporting and independent of the \"supplies\" from England. This meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward the colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be abandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family had been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had been sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent. Whether the company made any resistance to this development within the settlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter, will only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain that by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They had then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of the produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the monopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619, when the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most eagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys, by this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House committee which reported against monopolies. To such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir George Yeardley in November, 1618, called \"The Great Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes,\" recognized the necessity for local government. They provided for two houses, the \"Council of State,\" to be chosen by the company in its quarter court, and the general assembly, to consist \"of the Council of State and two Burgesses.\" For the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall, &c., entered for publication on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by the lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611.

Then, too, the first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610-1612, martial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the company now proposed; the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a minimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and the produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early settlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall, like Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the Indians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted in the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south, which became self-supporting and independent of the \"supplies\" from England. This meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward the colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be abandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family had been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had been sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent. Whether the company made any resistance to this development within the settlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter, will only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain that by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They had then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of the produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the monopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619, when the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most eagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys, by this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House committee which reported against monopolies. To such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir George Yeardley in November, 1618, called \"The Great Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes,\" recognized the necessity for local government. They provided for two houses, the \"Council of State,\" to be chosen by the company in its quarter court, and the general assembly, to consist \"of the Council of State and two Burgesses.\" For the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall, &c., entered for publication on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by the lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611.

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. \n\nThese letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328-332, 400-402, 402-413, 416-417. \n\nSee Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734-1756.",

            "text": "36 INTRODUCTION either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

            "text": "36 INTRODUCTION either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

            "text": "36 INTRODUCTION either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

            "text": "36 INTRODUCTION either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

            "text": "36 INTRODUCTION either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

They indicate a tendency in the company to grant private monopolies and to encourage private settlements\u2014measures which indicate the growing importance of the undertaking and the development of individual trade. Only one series of documents relating to individual adventures is extant, those by which Lord Zouch\u2019s investment in Virginia was secured to him. His contracts were made in May, 1618, with John Bargrave and James Brett. There is also his warrant to John Fenner to pass to Virginia and trade with the colony and the savages in his pinnace Silver Falcon, in February, 1618/19. The other series of documents, which illustrate the legal forms and methods of the company, as also the way in which the first plantations were undertaken by private means, concern Smythe\u2019s Hundred and Berkeley Hundred. Among the Ferrar papers are the minutes of the meeting of the committee for Smythe\u2019s Hundred on May 8, 1618, the first record concerning the hundred, which provides for the sending out and equipment of thirty-five men at an expense of \u00a3657 9s. 4d. \n\nVII.\u2014SUPPLEMENTARY CONTEMPORARY CORRESPONDENCE AND RECORDS  \nIn addition to the documents which are either official records or similar to such records in character, there is a large amount of correspondence between officers of state in England and other individuals which by its reference throws light on the affairs of the company or gives additional or corroborative data. All of this which is earlier in date than 1616 has been published by Alexander Brown. There are seven letters, the dates of which fall between 1616 and 1619, that are of the same character; but they add nothing in fact to the other documents, although two of them reveal the measures taken even at this early date to impress youths and maidens for Virginia and to send reprieved prisoners to the colony. Of the documents of this character, which are given by Brown, perhaps the correspondence between the Spanish ambassador in London and the King of Spain is the most valuable, not in the trustworthiness of the data\u2014though much of it confirms other sources\u2014but in the revelation it contains of the part that Spanish relations played in the development of the company and especially in its decline during the following decade, while its reference to prevalent rumors, reports, and sentiment are extremely illuminating. There are thirty-seven of these documents in all, including the correspondence concerning the Spanish ship Chaloner. The Chamberlain-Carleton, Digby-Salisbury, Cottington-Salisbury, and Lee-Wilson correspondence add occasion for these documents see List of Records, p. 129, Nos. 77, 82, 98, 99. Ibid., No. 76.

Sir Edwin Sandys moved, that whereas the bringing over of Sassafras in so great aboundance, had brought the price thereof to so low a rate, as it was now worth little; for remedy whereof [(] if the Court so thought fitt) they would make an offer to the Company in Virginia to compound with them for the same: which being brought over in a lesse quantity and all into one warehouse might be araysed to a better value, whereof the benefit should be duly answered to them againe in ordinance Powder Shot, and other such munition, for their better [179] strength and safety: And that they would signifie so much in the Councils letter to the Governor which motion was well approved of, and thereupon it was ordered that it might be effected accordingly. It was likewise moved that some might be appointed to drawe the said Councils letter vnto the Governor which was to goe with the Shippe now bound for Virginia: whereupon the Court entreated Sir Edwin Sandys to take some paines therein as he had often formerly done in the like kind at whose request he was pleased to undertake the dispatch thereof. Captain Roger Smith being desirous to goe this present voyage to Virginia, moved that he might have the charge of some of those people that were now sent to be the Companies Tenants. And further that the Company would please to bestow upon him some means to make him the better fitt for the said voyage: for as much therefore as the said Captain Smith was recommended to be a gentleman very sufficient for that imployment, and in regard of his good experience already (having been heretofore in Virginia about some three years) might thereby do the Company great service: The Court was pleased for his better encouragement to give him 30s: freely to furnish him with necessaries and ordered that he should have the command of 50 persons now transported to be Tenants upon the Companies land. Sir Edwin Sandys motion for bringing over of Sassafras. Sir Edwin Sandys desired to drawe the Generall Tre. Captain Roger Smith to have 30s: & the Command of 50 persons under him.",

And therein to complaine of the former greivances tending to the vtter destruction and overthrow of both the said Plantations, whereof they doubted not but they should finde the like redresse as of many other monopolies of like nature which the lower house had called into question and by his Majesties gracious permission intended vtterly to extinguish. [189] It was therefore ordered that a Committee should be appointed for drawing the said petition and for this purpose nominated Sir Francis Wyat, Mr. George Sandys, and Mr. Deputy Ferrar who are desired to take some paines therein and to make it in substance agreeable to that which Sir Edwyn Sandys had delivered vnto them. The Patent being read and put to the question to know whether they would have it so to passe or desired any thing to be added thereunto, it was generally well approved of, and thought to be drawne fully and exactly, for which the Company gave vnto Sir Edwyn Sandys many deserved thankes for his great paines taken therein. Hereupon Mr. Wrote took occasion to pray the Court, to take into consideration such suites as now depend betweene the Company and any person, being heretofore commenced in the name of the Treasurer between the Company (which by this new Patent was hereafter to be called the Governor and Company) were not so concluded, as they must of necessity be enforced to begin their suites anew: whereunto answeare was made that this change of Title could be no prejudice at all to any such suites considering the former Patents should not be surrendered but remaine still in force.",

Mr. Woodall. Mr. Keightly. Mr. Bull. Mr. Meuerell. \n\nSir Edwyn Sandys being desired to make reporte what had been done concerning the new Patent, signified vnto the Company, that whereas the Lord Viscount Doncaster had formerly presented a letter from the Counsell to the king, wherein among other things they did humbly entreate his Majesty's most gracious favour, to renew [191] their Patent, and that the same might be also confirmed by Act of Parliament, the better to strengthen the Plantation in generall by engaging of the whole State in the interest and support of the Action: It pleased his Majesty to signify his gracious pleasure by my Lord of Doncaster to Mr. Attorney generall for drawing up the same: To which end he said, that he and Mr. Herbert and Mr. Deputy had attended Mr. Attorney about the same, presenting him the draught which had formerly been read here in Court: and having acquainted him with the order he had used throughout the said booke by reducing it into three heads, viz. the first containing such immunities as had been granted in their former Patents, the second some additions as they had taken out of the Somer Islands Patent, the third such new clauses as time & experience had taught, to be necessary for them: whereunto he added likewise a fourth which was the amplifying and enlarging some necessary points as were in generall words employed in their former Grants. In reading whereof Mr. Attorney well observed that their new Incorporation differing in name from the old (the Tier being in this called by the name of Governor) was not warrantable in lawe in that manner as they had drawn it, without surrender of the former Patents, for that it did thereby imply two distinct Corporations: But this point Mr. Attorney undertook to amend by altering the forme, and framing it another way: But as for such new clauses & additions which they had made, Mr. Attorney desired he might have a special warrant from his Majesty to that effect: To which purpose Sir Edwyn Sandys said there was now a petition drawn to be exhibited to his Majesty for procuring a reference to such of his Highness most honourable: Sir Edwyn Sandys report of what had been done about the new Patent.",

And forasmuch as Captaine Newce hath given so large a testimony of his experience and skill in Marshall discipline wherein he hath been exercised and employed a long time, upon many services in Ireland, as also in matters of fortification and other warlike experiments no whit inferior to any (as hath been also testified) and for that he hath also promised to employ his best endeavours and service, to the good of that Plantation (which is like to prove a matter of great consequence unto it) in consideration whereof although there be no present necessity or use of such an officer in Virginia (in regard of the perpetuall league lately made betweene the Governor there and the Indian King) yet to gratifie his worthy undertaking, the Company are pleased to grant him the said place of Marshall, with 50 men to be his Tenants. And if the State of their Cash (which the Adventurers are now desired to examine) will permit, they will pay him in hand one Moytie of the money that he desires, and the other Moytie upon Certificate from the Governor of his arrivall in Virginia: As for other conditions of the Contract to be made betweene the Company and him: It is agreed and ordered that the generall Committees assisted with some of the Counsell hereafter named, shall further treat and conclude with him about the same, touching all particularities whatsoever, and to this end are desired to meet at St. Edwyn Sandys house upon Saturday being the 14th of this present Moneth. \n\nA Patent granted him. The place of Marshall granted to Sr. William Newce. 50 men to be allowed him. A Committee appointed to treat with him.",

Captain Mathewe Somers petition is referred to the examination of the said Committees before whom he is required to make it appear what was due vnto his Uncle Sir George Somers, as likewise the justness of his Clayme thereunto in the right of his said uncle now deceased, whose heire he pretendeth himself to be. [196] Sir Edwyn Sandys moved, that for so much as Sir Richard Bulkley having purchased two shares of land for which he had paid in his 25th, intended now to make a particular Plantation in Virginia, and to send over 100 persons at his owne Charge: moved that he might for that purpose have a Patent granted vnto him: which motion was accordingly assented vnto. Sir Edwyn Sandys signified that there was one (unknown to him by face) was now in hand with an excellent Treatise consisting of these five speciall heads: Defence, Plentie, Health, Trade and Manners, all tending to the reformation of the Colony in Virginia, and the future advancement of the generall Plantation: moved therefore that the Court would be pleased to make request, that the said Treatise might be perfected against the next meeting: Whereupon the Court entreated the same might be ready against that time. It was likewise moved that for so much as there hath hitherto been observed so great neglect and remissness in the Government of Virginia, from time to time (to the infinite prejudice of that Plantation) in that they have not duly performed those directions, which have from hence been commended to their care and execution, whereby little or nothing hath been effected, answerable to the great care and charge the Company have been at, for planting good and staple Commodities.

Power to displace: And besides they had already power in their said Patent to displace the Governor upon just occasions: which was conceived to be as much as would be granted unto them by Acte of Parliament touching that point. The opinion of Mr. Attorney Generall. Mr. Smith likewise moved: That for so much as the lotteries were now suspended, which hitherto had continued the reall and substantiall food, by which Virginia hath been nourished: That instead thereof, she might be now preserved, by divulging some fame and good report, as she and her worthy Undertakers did well deserve, declaring that it could not but much advance the Plantation in the popular opinion of the Common Subjects, to have a faire & perspicuous history, compiled of that Country, from her first discovery to this day: And to have the memory and fame of many of her worthies (though they be dead) to live and be transmitted to all posterities: As namely Sir Thomas Dale, Sir George Somers, Sir Walter Rawleigh, the Lord De la warr, Sir Thomas Gates and divers others; whereunto were it not for suspicion of flattery he would wish also the names of many her other worthies yet living and some of them now present in Court, might have also their honours and good deservings commended to eternall thankefulnesse, for that our inabilities had as yet no truer Coyne.

And that the other might not only with like care take into his charge the Rents and debts that now and hereafter shall be due unto the Company (there being already above 1000\" to be answered unto them) but further also see those directions that he shall receive from home for the setting forward all staple Commodities duly and faithfully executed from time to time (wherein a very great neglect hath hitherto been observed to the infinite prejudice of that Plantation). And forasmuch as Captain William Newce hath been specially recommended unto this Company by divers honourable persons of this kingdom for his fidelity, judgement, and sufficiency to undertake and perform the said office and service of Marshall, as having ever been exercised in military affaires and Armes: And for the said place of Treasurer because Mr. Sandys was in like manner proposed, whom all men conceived to be every way sufficient to take that charge upon him: It was thought fit and ordered that the generall Committees, assisted with some of the Counsell, should meet together and advise as well for settling of the said offices and places and for accommodating them with fitting allowances and people. As also to take the like care that the New Governor shortly to be sent be well provided and accommodated fitting for his place and quality. Whereupon Mr. The officers of Marshall & Treasurer held very necessary, Captain Newce for the place of Marshall, Mr. Sandys for the place of Treasurer, the Generall Committees to advise for the settling of the said offices.",

Deputy having informed the Court of Mr. Newland's good affection to the Plantation and of his extraordinary paines and care he had taken about the Shipping of the persons transported in the Abigaile taken in at the Isle of Wight: In consideration whereof the Court was pleased to bestow upon him five shares of land, recommending the same to the confirmation of this Quarter Court. [208] It was likewise moved that for so much as Mr. Bonnall keeper of the King's Silkewormes at Otland had so well deserved of the Company by his care in procuring the Frenchmen from Languedoc who were heretofore sent to Virginia and had likewise reported well of Virginia to his Majesty, upon occasion of speech (commending the Mulberry trees in that Country to be of the best kind) moved therefore that the Court would please to gratifie his good deserving with the gift of some shares of Land and to make him a free brother of the Company whereupon it was ordered he should have two shares and have his admittance accordingly. The Auditors and Committees according to a former order of Court having taken into their consideration the many businesses incident to the Secretaries office (far exceeding that which was done by the former Secretary) thought it fit in consideration thereof to enlarge his Salary from twenty pounds per annum to forty pounds for the time to come and for the year past to reward him with twenty pounds more than his former stipend in respect of his paines extraordinary. Sir John Dauers signified that it was the request of my Lady Lawarre unto this Court that in consideration of her goods remaining in the hands of Mr. Rolfe in Virginia she might receive satisfaction for the same out of his Tobacco now sent home. But for so much as it is supposed the said Tobacco is none of the said Rolfe's, but belonged to Mr. Peirce, it was thought fit that Mr. Henry Rolfe should acquaint my Lady Lawarre of his Brother's offer (as he informs) to make her Ladyship a good and faithful account of all such goods as remain in his hands upon her Ladyship's direction to that effect. [209] Five shares of Land bestowed on Mr. Newland. Two Shares bestowed on Mr. Bonnell & admitted to be free. The Secretaries Salary enlarged.",

In consideration hereof the said Committees have thought fitt, the better to enable him hereunto to allow him 200 pounds in hand toward the Charge of his present setting out, and other 200 pounds vpon Certificate of his arryvall in Virginia: the severall allowance this Court having duly considered conceived to be very reasonable, and being put to the question did ratifie and confirme.

Sr. Edwyn Sandys, vnto whom the Court have now added Mr. Deputy Ferrar, Mr. Herbert, and Mr. John Smith, Mr. Jermine. \n\nThe five shares of land granted to Mr. Newland as a free gift of the Company in reward of his extraordinary paines taken in their service in 20 shares bestowed on Sr. Edwyn Sandys. \n\nThe alienating and selling of shares at undervalue.

Touching this point it was conceived no true estimate could be made till the number of the families were knowne and rectified; But for the price of Tobacco at 3d. per pound it was thought fit to be valued according to the goodnes thereof and at no certaine price. It was further signified that as it hath been the use and practise of forraigne kings and Monarchs (to their great glory and renowne) at certaine times to send some speciall worthy persons whom they call their Sendicks to visite all their Dominions and remoter Countries, and by vertue of their prerogative and power to examine with a curious eye the actions and carriage of all the principall Officers and Governors, to the end that those that had deserved well might be rewarded with honour, and others punished according to their Demerites; The like course have been thought fit by the Counsell here to be taken with the Officers in Virginia, and that a choyse Committee of men of worth and integritie might be authorised to examine and enquire into the actions and doings of former Officers, and thereof to return a good Account unto the Company here that they may proceed further therein according to the rules of Justice and equitie. Sir Edwin Sandys acquainted the Company with an exquisite discourse that a gentleman had made (though not perfected) for the advancement of the Plantation who desired his name might not be made knowne; which discourse he had divided into those five heads. The first was most necessarie, which was matter of food and sustenance for the Colony, whereof he had discovered the defects and proposed the way how it might be supplied. The Second was matter of health for preserving of which he had given excellent directions, observing the want thereof not to be through the ill condition of the Climate so much as through the disordered doings of the people and their misgovernment.",

He further signified that my Lady Dale, late the wife of Sir Thomas Dale deceased, that worthy Knight and great advancer of the Virginia Action, desired a Patent for a particular Plantation which was granted and that direction should be given to the Governor to allot the place according to her Ladyship's request if it be not already planted. The like Patent with like direction to the Governor was ordered to be made ready for Sir Dudley Diggs and his Associates. The like Patent upon request was granted to Sir John Bourcher and his Associates. Master Smith acquainted the Court that there was one exceeding skillful in making of Salt that accompanies Master Berkley in his Voyage to Virginia at his own charge as yet to purpose to try whether it may be there effected or no; and of one other also who was not only a founder of Iron but expert in making all manner of Potts, brewing vessels of Iron, who offered his best service if the Company so please and that for some small consideration from them towards the keeping of his wife in his absence, desiring but 20 Nobles at his now going and so much more at the year's end if he can effect any good for the Company; otherwise he will return again at his own charge touching which motion the Court hath referred him to Master Deputy to treat with him and conclude if he can.

[234] Intelligence being given likewise of one undertaking to plant Liquorish if he might have consideration according to his propositions was referred to the said Committees. A Roll for Adventurers to underwrite for a Joynt Stocke was for providing of Apparrell and other necessaries which Sir George Yeardley had signified the Colony had great need of, and would be profitable to the Adventurers. All the remayne of this former Magazine being sold was now offered to such as would please to subscribe what some they would willingly adventure, whereof they were desired to consider against the next Court. Sir Edwin Sandys signified that Sir Richard Bulkley having purchased two shares of Land of the Company, and undertaken to plant 100 Persons in Virginia for which they had granted him a Patent under Seal, desired the Company would please to allot him Elizabeth Island neere Cape Cod to plant upon. The Court agreed that direction should be given to the Governor to that effect. Mr. Webb moved that some course might be taken that the two Indian Maids might be disposed of to free the Company of the weekly charge that now they are at for the keeping of them. Whereupon some having moved that they might be sent to the Summer Islands at the charge of this Company, it was thought fit rather to refer it to the next Court to determine thereof. Touching Mr. Franck's request that Lieutenant Pearce might be required to give satisfaction unto Mr. Franck for the charge of 4 men and the goods sent unto his sons upon the last supply which Mr. Rolfe took into his possession to Mr. Peirce's use, the Court ordered that for so much as it appeared there was some reckoning between Mr. Franck and Mr. Peirce not yet reconciled nor brought to a head, that directions should be given to the Governor to examine the matter of One Undertaking to plant Liquorish. A Roll for Adventurers. Sir Richard Bulkley to have his Land allotted at Elizabeth City. Mr. Webb's motion for the two Indian Maids. Mr. Franck's request.",

This motion was well approved and the Court entreated the Committee hereafter named to make some Declaration to the severall Companies, Cities and Townes what portion of Land belongs unto them in respect of their moneys adventured, as also what the charge will be to plant the same with people; and lastly what Mr. Dauison chosen Secretary, Mr. Dauison made free & of the Counsell in Virginia.

Upon the humble petition of Joyce Lodge, the Court have ordered that she shall have one Share of Land of 50 Acres for the Adventure of her person and her thirds out of the Land due for her personal Adventure, being the estate of her said deceased Husband; and besides, the Court have been pleased to bestow upon her one Share of Land more for one hundred Acres old Adventure in consideration of her goods that she saith she left behind her in Virginia. And according to her request, ordered the same to be assured unto her under the Companies Seal.\n\nMr. Peirce moving the Court would please to assign him the place where he desires his land might be set out, some of Martine Hundred. He alleged that the said Lands were already possessed by them; but Mr. Peirce affirmed the contrary, whereupon the Court ordered that further enquiry should be made, and being found who had the priority or first possession, it should be assigned accordingly.\n\nIntelligence being given of two Ministers that offered themselves to go for Virginia, the Court referred them to be treated with and concluded by the Committees. And for so much as Sir Frances Wyat desired he might make choice of one that was willing to go with him, the Court assented thereunto.\n\nMr. Deputy moved that the Court would give order for sealing the Contract made with Mr. Ewens, Master of the George, being drawn up according to the Contract made with him, which was ratified by a former Court. The Court thought fit to commend it to his care to see the same performed accordingly, as also to seal his Commission.\n\nMr. Edward Hackluite assigned two Shares of 25 Acres Adventure to Edmond Hackluite, one John More being next heir to Richard Hackluite his father, who deceased desired it might pass the approbation of this Court, which was accordingly granted, they finding his said father upon search of the book no way indebted to the Company for the same.",

They entreated Mr. Abdy, Mr. Chamberlyn, Mr. Essington and Mr. Bull Committee to meet and consult concerning the sale of this Tobacco now come home and thereupon to write their letters of advice and direction to Mr. John De Clark speedily to try the market and to return them answer how the prices went, Mr. Alderman persuading that the deferring of the sale a little while would cause a good rise in the price. \n\nMr. Chamberlyn and Mr. Bull were entreated to keep account of this Mr. Chamberlyn and present return and to take order for discharge of the fraight and all other duties and it was ordered that all such moneys as Mr. John De Clark should receive upon sale of the said Tobacco should be made over to Mr. Abraham Chamberlin and Mr. Richard Bull who for the same are to be accountable to the Magazine Company. \n\nLastly, upon the importunate desire of the Adventurers of the Magazine to come to some head in this intricate and tedious Stock, Mr. Essington was desired with all expedition to make ready the Account some time the next week and to present it to the Auditor appointed by the last Quarter Court to whom for the speedier protecting of the business were added Mr. Abdy & Mr. Bull.",

Norton had presented a bill of a greater charge than he had formerly proposed vnto the Committee amounting to 80\u00a3, which he demands partly for clearing the apparrell of the Italian gentlemen glassmen engaged for debt, and partly for buying some materials for their Glass worke without which they could doe nothing; if the Company would please to discharge and satisfie they should have for their securitie to be repaid againe the goods of the said Italians turned out to them [252] vntill the said workmen might be able to satisfie that debt out of the profits of their labour. This being taken into consideration it was at length thought fitt that he be referred to the former Committee to be treated with about the same, who are to make reporte how it may be done without too great charge vnto the Company. \n\nIt was signified that the Ladie Lawarr desired the Court would please to grant her a Commission directed to Sr. Fraunces Wyatt, Mr. sending his bill is referred to the Committee. My Lady Lawarra requests to grant her a Commission to George Sandys and others to examine and certifie as well what goods and money of her late husband deceased came to the hands of Mr. Rolfe in the year 1611 and to require that according to his promise she may be satisfied. And also to cause the Cape Marchants and some others of the old Planters to examine how Captaine Argall disposed of and to whose use he employed the goods and provisions transported in the Neptune 1618 appearing to be of no lesse value than 1500\u00a3 whereby she is to demand satisfaction for the same. \n\nThe Court thereupon ordered that the Governor, Mr. George Sandys, Mr. Thorpe and some others whom they should think good should take the premises into their consideration, and enquire what goods and Debts belonged to the late Lord Delawarr deceased and to whose hands they came and were committed. And whatsoever shall appear upon examination and proofe to be due to cause a restitution to be made to their uttermost value, or otherwise certifie unto the Company here, that they may take such order therein for the recovery of them or the value as also of the debts as to justice shall appertain; Provided that her Ladyship out of the worth of the said goods take order that the Company may be satisfied for the Debt they stand engaged for her said husband the Lord Lawarr according to an order of Court the 14th of March 1618 and another formerly made the 14th of January 1618.",

After this upon better consideration, and for some reasons mentioned in the said order of Courte, the Company were willing to entertain the said bargaine againe into their hands; But since that time Captaine Norton had now presented them a bill of a new charge amounting to no less than 80 li, over and above the former sum of 150 li which he said was to be disbursed partly for redeeming the said workmens apparrell and Tooles engaged now for Debts, and partly for such materials as he feared could not be had in Virginia, and without which they could not proceed in their said worke; He therefore thought good to propose it to the consideration of this Courte that he might know their further pleasure herein, assuring them that there was nothing left in Stocke to discharge so great a sum. Whereupon after much dispute about it, it was at length moved and desired that if the Companies stocke were no ways able to go through with so great a charge that then this Courte would please clearly to release Captaine Norton from the Bargaine of his former Contract and to yield the same bargaine to private Adventurers that would be willing to undertake the same with more ease and least free was generally held to be both just and reasonable, and thereupon the private Adventurers being accordingly put to the question it was agreed with generall consent that Captaine Norton should thereby be discharged of the said contract and left free for private Adventurers to entertain the said bargaine upon the same conditions in point of benefit that the Company should have done.",

These said good undertakings were generally approved of and moved many then present to underwrite in the said Rolls, And for the better furtherance and advancement of this Action it was moved & thought fit that direction should be given to the Governor to afford his best assistance herein. The said Adventurers have made choice of Mr. Blany to be their factor or Agent to trade with the Indians for Furrs, and for this purpose also Mr. Bland hath undertaken to procure one to joyne with him that is very skillfull in those kind of Commodities if the Adventurers think so good. It was moved that seeing Mr. John Peirce had taken a Patent of Sir Ferdinando Gorge and thereupon seated his Company within the limits of the Northern Plantation as by some was supposed whereby he seemed to relinquish the benefit of the Patent he took of this Company, that therefore his said patent might be called in unless it might appear he would begin to Plant within the limits of the Southern Colony. Hereupon the Court appointed Mr. Roberte, Mr. George Smith, and Mr. Webb to treat with Mr. Peirce about it and certifie at the next Court what answer they should receive from him. For so much as the Physicians place to the Company was now become void by reason of the untimely death of Doctor Bohune slain in the action. Directions to be given to the Governor Mr. Blany to be their Factor. Mr. Peirce his Patent to be called in.",

With this offer the Court [258] was contented for the present to release his Tobacco and ordered that direction should be given to Mr. Swaine to make sale of so much Tobacco as should amount to the said sum of 44\" to be made over to the Company. \n\nMr. Wrote acquainted the Court that having taken into consideration the present State of the Companies Stocke and knowing it to be utterly exhausted and that all means of supply for the present are altogether ceased, he conceived it to be a part of his duty to offer vnto this Honorable Court such of his conceptions as may for the present supply the Companies necessitie with great plenty and defray ordinary charges. First therefore he propounded that whereas there are divers commodities in Virginia of good value in themselves, which by the ouermuch greedines of the Planters have beyond all moderation been sent over in that abundance as the price of them is so abased as they will hardly discharge the fraight, and are now unprofitable both to the Adventurers and Planters; and for instance he named that of Saxafras, heretofore of good value and now not worth anything; that therefore hereafter divers of these Commodities may be appropriated to the Company and termed the Companies Commodities. Amongst these he propounded Captaine Weldens motion to take out his Tobacco brought home in the Duty, paying his fraight. Mr. Wrote offered to the Company such of his conceptions as divers Commodities in Virginia of good value in themselves to be appropriated to the Company.",

And for the future, to prevent scandal, that there be a course taken to decry the price of Tobacco in Virginia, as being the only colour they have to make good their assertions, for that Commodity is become their money and is valued at 30 the pound certain, (be it good or bad) whereby they are nourished in that thirstless and pernicious humour of planting Tobacco: and the evil returns they make they attribute still to the oppression of the Adventurers here, never considering the baseness of their Commodities and the infinite loss the Company have sustained by it; this being not only the Destruction of more than half the last Magazine adventure but the consumption also of well nigh all the Companies Stock by sending the last supply of Prentices and maids for whom the Planters have repaid them again in nothing but Tobacco at 30 p pound. And yet notwithstanding the public Declaration of the Company and private information by frequent letters and otherwise of the base estimation and price of the Commodity and of their desire to be repaid in other Commodities, yet such is their opinion of this alone as it hath not been possible hitherto to awake them out of this strange dream; He therefore advised that besides the decrying of Tobacco, some course be taken that some other Commodity may be made their Coin and that Tobacco might be vented as a merchandise only of no certain price but according to the goodness; this he desired might be committed as the former; Whereupon the Court ordered that the former Committee should take it into their Consideration and certify their opinions what they should think fit to be done therein. \n\nMr. Wrote declaration of the sinister Courses & injurious Calumnies whereby this Company hath been abused.",

It was therefore moved that in gratificacion of his good endeavours herein the Court would please to admit him a free brother of the Company which request was thought very reasonable and being put to the Question was assented unto by erection of hands.",

Information was given that whereas divers noblemen and Gentlemen were still indebted to the Company vpon their subscriptions and in like manner certaine Bishops for money remaining in their hands vpon Collections, an offer was now made by one Mr. Waterhouse, a verie sufficient understanding gentleman for soliciting the said persons for payment of their said moneys if the Company shall please to imploy him in the said buisines and authorise him for the doing thereof. It was hereupon agreed that he should be entertained for this imployment provided his demands were reasonable and that he could give the Company good securitie for answering the moneys that he received from time to time to be paid into the Companys Treasury. Touching whereof the Court appointed these Committees to treat with him about the same, viz. Sr. Iohn Dauers, Mr. Abraham Chamberlyn, Mr. Deputy, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Edwarde, Mr. Tomlyns, Mr. Robert, or any four. Mr. Ayres informed the Court that there were some men that would willingly proceed in their Adventure but having paid in their moneys as may appeare by their bills yet they found their names left out in the printed booke and therefore desired they might be righted in those defects: The Court therefore referred this to the examination of the Auditors, upon whose report they have promised that right shall be done vnto them to their full satisfaction. For a declaration of the disposition of this money, see List of Records, No. 289, page 152, ante. Mr. Waterhouse entertained for Collecting in of subscriptions a Committee to treat with him some left out in the printed Book desired to be righted.",

Mr. Essington was entreated to perfect the Magazine Accounts to the end that such monneys as shall be due before Christmas might be divided amongst the Adventurers without longer delay: which was hoped would prove halfe a Capitall. Notice was also given that there were certaine sufficient men come out of Ireland who would undertake to transporte many hundreds of Cattle to Virginia this Springe vpon the same Conditions that Mr. Gookin had done; It was therefore moved that Southampton Hundred, Martins Hundred, Berkleys Hundred, and all other private Plantations that desired to have Cattle would be pleased out of hand to give speedy notice what numbers of Cattle they would have; being certainly knowne they might proceed to a further treaty with the said persons. Mr. Chamberlyne recommended vnto the Company one Mr. Staples, a preacher who having a brother in Virginia that had given him a good encouragement to come thither was desirous to goe ouer; Whereupon some of Martins Hundred seemed to be willing to entertaine him for their hundred. Mr. John Smith moved that whereas Mr. William Tracy before his going over to Virginia was arrested for 200 principal debt for which he putt in bayle 37 pounds 7 shillings 8 pence, suit hath since proceeded and been prosecuted so as the said cause was ready for judgment whereof stay was made until some witnesses might be brought in to certifie of the said Mr. Tracy's death. In respect whereof and for that he hath received information by letters that the said William Tracy dyed in Aprill last, he desires notice of such as came lately from Virginia that may be ready vpon occasion to witness the death of the said gentleman, touching which the Company promised to procure him as many as they could hereof.",

But their Lordships told them that they were not to dispute at that Board, and again gave them an absolute command to bring in all their Tobacco. \n\nAt this Report the Court remained much grieved and conceiving it a matter of greater importance and difficulty than to admit any present deliberation, especially of so few, they were resolved that the business should be reserved entire for the Preparative and Quarter Courts to take into their grave considerations how the Company should proceed between two such extreme difficulties as their Lordships command and the utter disheartening of all both Adventurers and Planters. Notwithstanding these apprehended disasters, M' Deputy exhorted the Company not to be discouraged for that he hoped God had still a hand in the protection of Virginia, who turned all things for the best, when divers former Projects in their first appearance seemed to tend toward the very destruction of the Plantation; and therefore hoped that having put their hands to the Plough they would not now look back nor be weary of well doing, for the Action itself was such, as he knew no man but confessed it to be most Christian, honourable, and glorious, and of high consequence unto this commonwealth; and though they might seem to some to have cast their bread upon the waters; yet after many days he doubted not but they should find it again, to their great comfort, the rather in regard their Lordships professed to wish the prosperity of the Plantation from whom we may not despair of help or redress upon further information.\n\nThe handwriting changes at the top of the following page to that of an unidentified copyist, referred to in the \u201cIntroduction\u201d as the fourth copyist.

And that although this some of money was but a small proportion to performe so great a worke, yet Mr. Copland said he doubted not, but to persuade the East Indy Companie (whom he meant to solicite), to make some Addition thereunto, beside he said that he had very effectually writt (the Coppie of which letter he shewed and was read) to divers Factories in the East Indies to stirr them vp to the like Contribution toward the performance of this pious worke as they had already done for the building of a Church at Wappinge where by his Report they have given about 400. It being therefore now taken into consideration whither a Church or a Schoole was most necessarie and might nearest agree to the intentions of the Donors: It was conceived that for so much as each particular Plantation as well as the generall either had or ought to have a Church appropriated vnto them, there was therefore a greater want of a Schoole than of Churches: As also for that it [276] was impossible with so small a proportion to compasse so great a charge as the building of a Church would require, they therefore conceived it most fitt to resolve for the erecting of a publique free schoole which being for the education of Children and grounding of them in the principles of religion, Civility of life and humane learning served to carry with it the greatest weight and highest consequence vnto the Plantations as that whereof both Church and commonwealth take their originall foundation and happie estate, this being also like to prove a worke most acceptable vnto the Planters, through want whereof they have been hitherto constrained to their great cost to send their Children from thence hither to be taught. Secondly it was thought fitt that this schoole should be placed in one of the fower Cities and they conceived that Charles Citty, of the fower did afford the most convenient place for that purpose as well.",

Upon the humble petition of M' Anthony Gosnold gentleman it is agreed and ordered first that he shall haue two shares of land in Virginia, due vnto him for the aduenture of 25\" in money paid into the Treasury to Sr. Thomas Smith as by his bill now shewed by him in Court under the Companies Seale though it were not sett downe in the printed booke under the Companies Seale may appeare.

Captain Henry Fortescue Uncle and Administrator of the goods and Chattells of Symond Fortescue who died intestate at Sea at his returne for England from Virginia, moued, that forsomuch as he cannot himselfe goe to Virginia to recover such landes, goods and Debts as are due vnto the said Symond Fortescue deceased whereof Sir George Yeardley stands indebted 250\u00a3, that it would therefore please this Honourable Court to write to the Gouernor to informe himselfe of the personall estate of the said Symond Fortescue and to afford his Kindred and friends all lawfull favour and Assistance for recovery of the said Fortescue\u2019s landes, goods and Debts: The Court conceived this motion to be verie reasonable and therefore ordered that direction shall be given to the Gouernor of Virginia to take such order in the premises as may be most agreeable to equity and good conscience. Elizabeth Smalley Widdowe hauing petitioned to the King against Captaine Argall pretending that he deteyned certaine goods from her to the value of 500\u00a3, and being referred by his Majesty to his Highnes Counsell for Virginia did now petition to the Companie to take hearing of the said cause according to his Majesty's Reference, whereupon the Counsell agreed to meet upon Friday following in the Written over Mr., 16455\u2014vol. 1\u201406\u2014\u201435.",

Forsomuch as it seemed the Companie intended to imploy the said Mr. Pountis in their seruice, that they would please in consideration hereof to giue the said priuate Adventurers send greater proportion of land for the 25 men formerly sent ouer [283]. As also some consideration for the goods remaining, whereof the Companie might make good vse. Touching the first, an answer was made that the Companie did not conceaue Mr. Pountis to be any way engaged vnto them, but rather had received much prejudice by their failing him of their promised Supplies, whereby he could effect nothing for want of meanes, where it did appeare he was so much disheartened as it made him put on a resolution to come home for England, had not the Companie given him some encouragement to stay by conferring this place vpon him, as also the managing of some other business. As for such goods of theirs as yet remained, it was lawfull and free for them to make their best market, whereby there could be no great losse. Mr. Deputy signified that he was to move the Court for grant of three seuerall Patents for particular Plantations unto such as would undertake to transport at their owne charge one hundred persons a piece to Virginia: the first for Sr. Charles North, the second for Mr. Crowe, the third for Mr. Leninge, with seuerall Patents the Company gaue order for drawing them vp in that vsuall forme against the Quarter Court. Whereas in drawing vp the Patents for Sr. Richard Worsley and his Associates, there was a mistake in setting downe of Anthony Jennings for Abraham, it was moved that the error might be amended at the next Court, which was granted. It was ordered by consent of the Adventurers of the old magazine that Mr. Abraham Chamberlen shall take vp as much money here as appeareth by the Account of John De Clarke to be due to the old Magazine and remaine in his hands, and pay the same ouer to Mr. Richard Bull that a dividend may be made to the Adventurers.",

Whereas the Company had formerly contracted with Captaine Norton for setting up of a glasse furnace in Virginia to make glasse and beads (as by the particulars of the said Contract more at large may appeare) It was now declared that for so much as the Charge of furnishing out the said Capt Norton (when it came to be particularly examined) did far exceed that proportion which he had before proposed to the Company insomuch as the Common Stock being altogether exhausted was no way able to performe the same, so that this great work whereof the Company had conceived so good a hope was like to have fallen to nothing for want of sufficient meanes [291] to goe forward with it; for which cause the Company having given it over it pleased certain private Adventurers to uphold the same and thereupon entertained the bargaine made with Capt. Norton and the Italians upon like conditions as the Company had done, and yet being unwilling to exclude the Company from a business so much concerning them they did agree they should joyne with them in a fourth part of the Charge and so partake a fourth of the benefit that should any ways accrue thereby. In consideration whereof as also for their better encouragement the said Adventurers moved that the Company would please to bestow amongst them all the lands that should be due for transportation of people sent thither to be employed upon the said work, which motion the Court conceived to be very reasonable and fit to be granted in respect of the great charge they have and must still be at in prosecution thereof; being therefore put to the question the Court confirmed the same unto them.

It was likewise moved that the Companie would please to admit Mr. Balmeford into their Society in respect he had deserved so well by his often attendance at Court and readiness to do the Companie service, for which cause the Court hath made him free and do intreat his accustomed pains and attendance in the service of the Companie. \n\n16455\u2014vol 1\u201406\u2014\u201436",

Which Patents were of two sorts: the one of such as were Adventurers by moneys paid into the Treasury, for which they had allowed 100 acres of land for every single share of Twelve pounds Ten shillings; the other being for Planters only, who had allowed fifty acres for every person transported to Virginia. According to which two formes the said Patents were drawn and accordingly engrossed, ready for the Seale, being these that follow: To Arthur Swayne, Nathaniell Basse, Adventurers, and to their Associates who undertake to transport 100 persons to Virginia.

Also wherein it is so ordered that none shall subscribe aboue 100\" nor any man for lesse than 20\". Whereof onely a Third part for the present voyage is to be employed in this Roll; there is already underwritten the Some of 900\" which Shippe is also departed. The fifth Roll which is the last though not the least in estimation is for the sending of Shipwrights and house Carpenters to Virginia where plenty of materials is to be had, so that the onely want was of skillfull and sufficient workemen in those kinde of professions whereof Divers did now offer themselves to goe, with whom the Colony being once furnished they will in short time be enabled with Pynnaces and Boates to make further discoveries vp into the Countrie; and by meanes of houses ready framed to their hands and afforded at reasonable rate, the Planters there and such as come newe over will be able to furnish themselves from time to time with substantiall houses well built and in a good manner to the comfort of the Inhabitants and future strength of the Plantation. Hereupon it was signified that it was not the intent and meaning of the former private Adventurers to exclude any or to appropriate the same solely to such as had already underwritten, but that it was free for any member of the Companie to ioyne with them and partake of the honour and [299] and profit that would arise vnto them thereby; whereupon many gentlemen then present did offer themselves. \n\nA letter to the Colony by the Company, concerning the third and fourth Rolls, is mentioned in List of Records, No. 279, p. 151, ante.",

Captaine Leeke presenting a Letter to this Court from the right Honourable the Lord Chamberlen directed vnto the Counsell and Company of Virginia; being opened and read, it appeared that his Lordship moved for two things in the behalfe of Capt. Leeke; the one was that he might be made one of the Counsell of State in Virginia (where he intended to plant himselfe); the other that he might have the place of Colonel conferred vpon him in respect of his sufficiency and experience to performe that office. Which place Capt. Leeke himselfe also said that he affected onely for the honors sake without desiring to put the Company to any Penny charge for the same; whereupon the Court being willing to satisfie his Lordship so far as conveniently they might in respect of his Lordship's good affection vnto the Plantation and Honourable endeavour to aduance the same, hath therefore made choice of a select Committee to take it into their consideration, viz. Sir Iohn Dauers, Mr. Wheatly, Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Ayres, Mr. Wrote, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Nicholas Farrar, Mr. Roger Smith, Mr. Abraham Chamblen, Mr. Baynham, Mr. Mellinge, or any 5 of them who for the better expedition of the business in regard of Mr. Leeke's sodaine going into the Country are desired to meet this next Friday being the 6th of this present Moneth about two in the Afternoone at Mr. Farrars and are entreated to make report of their opinions touching the premisses.

Bassey and his Associates for a particular Plantation, it was desired that the Patent might be renewed only for inserting the names of such as were to be his Associates, which the Court assented unto. \n\nM' Deputy acquainted the Court that one M' Leat, a Minister, being heretofore in Newfoundland and preacher there, whom M' Slany the merchant commended for his civill and good carriage, the said M' Leat having upon conference with some of Virginia heard a good report of that Countrey, was now desirous to goe over, not meaning to put the Company to any further charge than only to furnish him with necessaries and such bookes as shall be usefull unto him; hoping they would please to recommend him to the Governor (with whom he desires to remaine till a place in that Countrey become void) that he may be then preferred. \n\nThe Court thought very reasonable and referred him to the generall Committee to be treated and concluded with touching some moderate allowance to be bestowed upon him, and have appointed him to preach upon Sunday come sennight in St. Seyths Church in the afternoone, proposing severall Texts unto him to take his choice, but being more willing to take what text the Company would give him, they have appointed him the 9th of Isay, 2nd verse. \n\nM' Nicholas Farrar, being formerly chosen Treasurer by the Adventurers of the glassworks, moved that for so much as he had issued out 16455\u2014vol. 1\u201406\u201437.",

He brought the money also vnto the next Court and there spent read in the Box unopened: Whereupon the Court after a large and serious deliberation how the said money might be best employed to the use intended, at length resolved that it was fittest to be entertained by the Societies of Southampton Hundred and Martins Hundred, and each to undertake for a certaine number of the Infidell Children to be brought up by them, and amongst them in Christian Religion and some good Trade to live by according to the Donors religious desire; But Martins Hundred desired to be excused by reason their Plantation was sorely weakened and as then in much confusion: Whereupon it being pressed that Southampton Hundred should undertake the whole, they also considering together with the weight the difficulty also and hazard of the business were likewise very unwilling to undertake the managing thereof and offered an addition of 100\u00a3 more unto the former sum of 550\u00a3 that it might not be put upon them. But being earnestly pressed thereunto by the Court and finding no other means how to set forward that great work yielded in fine to accept thereof: Whereupon soon after at an Assembly of that Society the Adventurers entered into careful consideration how this great and [314] weighty business might with most speed and great advantage be effected: Whereupon it was agreed and resolved by them to employ the said money together with an addition (out of the said Societies purse) of a far greater sum toward the furnishing out of Captaine Bluett and his Companie being very able and sufficient workmen with all manner of provisions for the setting up of an Iron worke in Virginia, whereof the profits accruing were intended and ordered in a ratable proportion to be faithfully employed for the educating of 30 of the Infidell Children in Christian Religion and",

This request was thought verie reasonable, and hauing a Deed to this purpose ready drawne (according to the order of the former Court) which was now presented and read, the Court approved thereof and ordered it to be sealed. [317] M' Deputy signified that M' Leat the Minister being appointed to preach this last Sunday in St. Seyths Church vpon a Text the Company gaue him had performed the same with good approbation and being still desirous to goe to Virginia recommended to the Governor and Counsell there to remayne in expectance till some place in the Ministry become void, did therefore praye the Company would please to furnish him with some small allowance for bookes and other necessaries: which request hauing been formerly taken into consideration it was thought fit to allow him 20s to furnish him with booke and apparrell, and to pay for his transportation: which allowance the Court did well approve of. M' Deputy signified that one Henry Mansell in his petition to my Lord Keeper, amongst other his grievances he complained that the Virginia Company stood indebted vnto him in 60s aboue these six or seauen yeares; for which cause being present at the Summer Islands Court held on Monday last in the morning he was willed by the whole Court to attend the Preparative Court held for Virginia in the afternoone, where if he could make the said Debt appeare to be due vnto him they doubted not but order would be taken to giue him satisfaction; but he neither appeared then nor now.",

But for his own particular judgement, he doubted that neither of the two courses particularised in this last letter, now read in Court, would attain the effect so much desired: for to send for them into England and to have them educated here, he feared (upon experience of those brought by Sr. Tho: Dale) might be far from the Christian work intended. Again, to begin with building of a free school for them in Virginia, he doubted (considering that none of the buildings there intended had as yet prospered) by reason that as yet through their doting so much upon Tobacco, no such workmen could be had but at intolerable rate; it might rather tend to the exhausting of this sacred Treasure in some small fabric than to accomplish such a foundation, as might satisfy men's expectations; whereupon he wished again some meeting between the Gentlemen or his friends and Southampton Society, that all things being debated at full and judiciously weighed, some constant course might be resolved on and pursued for the proceeding in and perfecting of this most pious work, for which he prayed the blessing of God to be upon the Author thereof; and all the Company said Amen.\n\nIn the midst of this narration, a stranger stepped in presenting 4 books fairly bound sent from a person refusing to be named, who had bestowed them upon the College in Virginia, being from the same man that gave heretofore four other great books. The names of these he now sent were these, viz. a large Church Bible, the Common Prayer Book, Ursinus' Catechisme, and a small Bible richly embroidered: The Court desired the Messenger to return the gentleman that gave them their general acknowledgment of much respect and thanks due unto him. A letter also was presented from one that desired not as yet to be named with 25\u00a3 in gold to be employed by way of Addition unto the former contribution towards the building of a free school in Virginia.",

Whereas Sr. Francis Iones hath assigned under his hand and Seal all his interest unto three shares of land in Virginia unto Sr. Iohn Wolstenholme as by his said Assignment Dated primo October 1621 allowed by the Auditors may appeare, Nowe the said Sr. Iohn Wolstenholme hauing in like sort by his said Assignment given and granted the said shares unto Iohn Harrison his Servant, did now move they might accordingly passe the approbation of this Court. Whereupon the said three Shares being put to the question were confirmed unto the said John Harrison. Touching the Complaint of Mr. Anthony Ireby against one that had underhand (as he saith) sought to deprive him of his interest in two shares of land in Virginia, it was informed by Mr. Carter the Officer that the said Anthony Ireby had two yeares since in open Court passed away his said shares unto one Martin Earle who had likewise sold the same unto others with the approbation of the Court. Whereupon Mr. Carter was appointed to signify so much unto the said Ireby that he might be satisfied without farther Complaint. \n\nMr. Deputy acquainted the Court that one Mr. Io: Clarke being taken from Virginia long since by a Spanish Ship that came to discover that Plantation by whom he was carried to Spayne and there detained fower yeares thinking to have made him an instrument to betray that Plantation, that for so much as he hath since that time done the Company good service in many voyages to Virginia and of late went into Ireland for transportation of Cattle to Virginia he was an humble Suitor to this Court that he might be admitted a free Brother of the Company and have some shares of land bestowed upon him, which request the Court taking into consideration have been pleased first to grant him his freedome and have also thought fit that two shares of land old Adventure be given him as a free gift of the Company which they have recommended to the next Quarter Court for confirmation.",

Upon reading the order of the former Court touching Captain William Weldens undue performance of the trust reposed in him by the Company in breach of the Contract made with them, he being now present, moved, that forsomuch as he could not get the Committee (vnto whom this busines was formerly referred) to meet nor could stay any longer in Towne being to proceed upon other voyages, that this Court would therefore please to take this busines into their consideration and finally order it, and thereupon presented a writing vnto the Court which seemed to be framed in justification of himselfe and of what he had done, offering to proue whatsoever he had therein set downe. [826] Whereupon it being read and his reasons particularly examined, it was found and so adjudged by the Court to be very false and scandalous in many things as may appeare by the Answers made vnto each seuerall objection which were these that followe. To his first objection touching a promise of a supply of 50 men more (the Spring immediately after his first setting out) and that vpon the same termes as those formerly sent with him, though it was not expressed in his Contract yet he said it was promised by Sr. Edwin Sandys then Treasuror in his conference with him. It was denied and signified by Sr. Edwin Sandys that he neuer made any such promise, and that what he spake was but onely a Declaration of a purpose and intent of favour toward him for his better encouragement in that Action in case sufficient meanes came in and that he carried himselfe well whereby to deserue it of the Company. To his second Objection that he was promised 3 Shares of land to be set out for him, which the Governor denied to do in respect he had no such order from the Company, forsomuch as they remembred no such promise they referred him for this to his Contract which he being willed to shew said he had lost it. A letter of complaint from Weldon to Sir Edwin Sandys is referred to in List of Records, No. 168, page 139, ante.",

Welden did testifie it vnto them; But to salve this Capt. Welden saith that the Governor hath taken order that the Tenants should have the fruit of their labours for that first yeare, but vntill the Companies pleasure were knowne, and in case the Companie should Demaund it they should make it good out of their next Croppe. \n\nLastly he said that forsomuch as all that 900 weight of Tobacco he brought home vpon his owne Account (except 60 weight of Mr. Bucks for which he is to send him returnes) he bought with that apparrell, linnen, beddinge, brasse and houshold stuffe of good value he carried with him & sold there at reasonable rate as also in commiseration & recompense of his paines and trouble in their service that therefore the Companie would please to remitt him the 44 shillings staid vpon his Tobacco by a former order of Court (whereof 40 markes was giuen him to furnish him out and the rest allowed him for the passage of himselfe and two men) Whereupon Captaine Welden being willed to withdraw himselfe the Court tooke the premisses into their consideration and observing duly what the Governor had writ concerning him, signifying he had giuen no good Account of his place.",

Martin had excepted against and not spared to traduce some of the said Committee, notwithstanding they proceeded with as much respect and favour toward him as in reason could be required; that therefore it would please the Court to take this business againe into their owne hands and Debate the same in the presence of this generall Assembly. \n\nWhereupon the Court caused the said Certificate to be read which was in the name of the Counsell and Company for Virginia here resident.",

The Court thereupon taking this matter into their consideration did well approve of what Mr. Deputy had done, holding it unfit the Records of the Company should passe abroad without license of a Court. And touching Mr. Alderman Johnsons request in the name of the rest of the Commissioners, the Court are willing to give way thereunto and hath ordered the Secretary to attend the Commissioners with the said Court booke at their next meeting to be perused by them and after to bring the said booke againe. And for further caution hereafter it is ordered that neither the Court booke nor booke of Account nor the Kings Letters Patents to the Company nor any other matter of Record whatsoever shall be delivered to any except principall Officers of the Company without consent and license of the Court; and for that this order may the more duly be observed and kept, it is referred to the former Committee to consider thereof that it may be made a law. \n\nForsomuch as Mr. William Caninge hath been often warned to bring in his Account in respect his pretended claime of much money due unto him from the Company and yet hath refused hitherto to present them; it is therefore ordered he shall be once againe peremptorily warned to bring them in with intimation that if he faile hereof between this and the next Virginia Court the Company are resolved otherwise to proceed against him in legall course to force him thereunto.",

A request was made in the behalfe of Mr. Iohn Berkley, Master of the Iron worke in Virginia, that in respect he had with extraordinary Skill and industrie brought that long desired worke to so good forwardnesse as to vndertake so confidently to make Iron there by Whitsontyde next, as by his owne and Mr. Sandys letter appeared, the Companie would please for his better encouragement in so hopefull a worke to supplie him and his people with such prouision as he hath most earnestly desired in his letter, which charge he hath promised to repaye againe out of the first fruit of their labours. The request being taken into serious consideration and with all the benefit and consequence of so great a worke vnto the whole Plantation, and for so much as the Companies Stocke was quite exhausted, the Court againe entreated Mr. Deputy as formerly to take up so much money as might supplie him, for which he should be secured as before it hath been declared. Whereas Mr. Dike was entertained to be usher in the free scoole intended in Virginia, it was now signified that he having since shewed a willingness to resigne that place by reason of some other hopes he had to preferre himself here in England, the Committee thought fit in regard of his long waiting and Dependence upon that imployment to bestow upon him \u00a33 to discharge him with agreement and allowance this Court did well approve of. Mr. Deputy moved for drawing up a Patent for Sir Bowyer Worsley who intended to transport and plant divers persons in Virginia: Whereupon the Court ordered a Patent to be made ready for him against the next Quarter Court. Upon reading a letter presented in Court directed to Mr. Deputy Farrar from one Mr. Nicholas Hawes signifying of two Bills of Exchange made over unto him the said Hawes by Mr. Henry Rolfe payable long.",

            "text": "42 INTRODUCTION  \nIt also includes many original records of the colony, many eighteenth century transcripts of the original commissions, patents, and other records, and many recent transcripts and photographs of documents in the collections of England. The eighteenth century transcripts and the original documents and contemporary copies came to the Library of Congress from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s collection in two different groups: the first in 1815, when his library, purchased \u2018in a lump as it stood on the catalogue,\u201d was secured by Congress for the sum of $23,950; the second was secured when the books of Mr. Jefferson were sold at auction subsequent to his death in 1826. The catalogue of the auction sale classified those acquired by the Library of Congress at the latter date under two numbers as follows:  \n\u2018*No. 121. Records of the Virginia Company, 2 vols., fol. MS. (the authentic copy mentioned in Stith\u2019s History).  \n**No. 122. Old Records of Virginia, 4 vols. fol. MS. viz:  \n\u2018*A. Letters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625. (42) Transactions in council and assembly, their petition and his majesty\u2019s answer.  \n\u2018*B. (9). Orders from Feb. 1622 to Nov. 1627.  \n**C. (82) A. Foreign business and Inquisitions from 1665 to 1676. Transactions of the council from Dec. 9, 1698, to May 20, 1700.\u201d  \nThe volumes of Jefferson manuscripts relating to the company, which became the property of the Government in 1815, were as follows:  \n(1) First laws made by the Assembly in Va. anno 1623 (Used by Hening.)  \n(2) Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634. (Used by Hening.)  \n(3) Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, with a small quarto containing abstracts of Rolls in the offices of State bound into the volume. (Commonly known as the Bland copy, because so cited by Hening.)  \nManuscript letters of Thomas Jefferson in the Library of Congress. In this letter to William Hening, March 11, 1815, from Monticello, Mr. Jefferson stated that he could not retain a volume, since Congress had purchased his library.  \nThe \u2018Catalogue. President Jefferson\u2019s library .... (as arranged by himself,) .... to be sold at auction, at the Long Room, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington .... ..--. , 27th of February, 1829, Ber Seo ,\u2019 p. 4, is in the Library of Congress, Miscellaneous Pamphlets, Vol. 859, No. 14.  \nThis is classified as one folio manuscript in the catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1830, and the latter is doubtless the manuscript covering the period from 1626-1634. This manuscript also contains loose papers to 1632.  \n*Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1880, p. 167.  \n*Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1815, p. 73.  \nThis is probably the same manuscript as that mentioned above under the Jefferson catalogue as No. 122 (42). There is no other manuscript in the Library which corresponds to the title here given or to the description above.",

            "text": "42 INTRODUCTION  \nIt also includes many original records of the colony, many eighteenth century transcripts of the original commissions, patents, and other records, and many recent transcripts and photographs of documents in the collections of England. The eighteenth century transcripts and the original documents and contemporary copies came to the Library of Congress from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s collection in two different groups: the first in 1815, when his library, purchased \u2018in a lump as it stood on the catalogue,\u201d was secured by Congress for the sum of $23,950; the second was secured when the books of Mr. Jefferson were sold at auction subsequent to his death in 1826. The catalogue of the auction sale classified those acquired by the Library of Congress at the latter date under two numbers as follows:  \n\u2018*No. 121. Records of the Virginia Company, 2 vols., fol. MS. (the authentic copy mentioned in Stith\u2019s History).  \n**No. 122. Old Records of Virginia, 4 vols. fol. MS. viz:  \n\u2018*A. Letters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625. (42) Transactions in council and assembly, their petition and his majesty\u2019s answer.  \n\u2018*B. (9). Orders from Feb. 1622 to Nov. 1627.  \n**C. (82) A. Foreign business and Inquisitions from 1665 to 1676. Transactions of the council from Dec. 9, 1698, to May 20, 1700.\u201d  \nThe volumes of Jefferson manuscripts relating to the company, which became the property of the Government in 1815, were as follows:  \n(1) First laws made by the Assembly in Va. anno 1623 (Used by Hening.)  \n(2) Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634. (Used by Hening.)  \n(3) Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, with a small quarto containing abstracts of Rolls in the offices of State bound into the volume. (Commonly known as the Bland copy, because so cited by Hening.)  \nManuscript letters of Thomas Jefferson in the Library of Congress. In this letter to William Hening, March 11, 1815, from Monticello, Mr. Jefferson stated that he could not retain a volume, since Congress had purchased his library.  \nThe \u2018Catalogue. President Jefferson\u2019s library .... (as arranged by himself,) .... to be sold at auction, at the Long Room, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington .... ..--. , 27th of February, 1829, Ber Seo ,\u2019 p. 4, is in the Library of Congress, Miscellaneous Pamphlets, Vol. 859, No. 14.  \nThis is classified as one folio manuscript in the catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1830, and the latter is doubtless the manuscript covering the period from 1626-1634. This manuscript also contains loose papers to 1632.  \n*Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1880, p. 167.  \n*Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1815, p. 73.  \nThis is probably the same manuscript as that mentioned above under the Jefferson catalogue as No. 122 (42). There is no other manuscript in the Library which corresponds to the title here given or to the description above.",

Instructions, Commissions, letters of Advice and admonitions, and Public Speeches, Proclamations, &c. Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assembly. The entire set in the first group, acquired in 1829, is composed either of original documents or of contemporary transcripts, while the second paper of the second group belongs to the same period. The Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683, are a seventeenth century transcript. The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R. Hickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification of these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the company, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as the [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion, arising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of Virginia, William Stith and John D. Burk, and by the editor of many of the documents in 1809, William Hening. The following statements with regard to the first group made by Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1825, will serve as a basis for the attempt to ascertain the history and authenticity of those manuscripts:  \n\u2018The only manuscripts I now possess relating to the antiquities of our country are some folio volumes: Two of these are the proceedings of the Virginia company in England; the remaining four are of the Records of the Council of Virginia, from 1622 to 1700. The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to Stith's History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company, copied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of Southampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor Byrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These volumes happened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland, whose library I purchased, and with this they were sent to me. I gave notice of it to Mr. Zane, but he never reclaimed them.  \n\u2018The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the council. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin the History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from the council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he had made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably unobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his executor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes were sent to me as a part of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being handled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily opened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years.\u2019  \nFrom the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825.  \nCol. R. Bland died October 26, 1776.",

            "text": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624  \n(4) Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683. Instructions, Commissions, letters of Advice and admonitions, and Public Speeches, Proclamations, &c. Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assembly. The entire set in the first group, acquired in 1829, is composed either of original documents or of contemporary transcripts, while the second paper of the second group belongs to the same period. The Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683, are a seventeenth century transcript. The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R. Hickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification of these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the company, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as the [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion, arising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of Virginia, William Stith and John D. Burk, and by the editor of many of the documents in 1809, William Hening. The following statements with regard to the first group made by Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1825, will serve as a basis for the attempt to ascertain the history and authenticity of those manuscripts:  \n\u2018The only manuscripts I now possess relating to the antiquities of our country are some folio volumes: Two of these are the proceedings of the Virginia company in England; the remaining four are of the Records of the Council of Virginia, from 1622 to 1700. The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to Stith's History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company, copied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of Southampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor Byrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These volumes happened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland, whose library I purchased, and with this they were sent to me. I gave notice of it to Mr. Zane, but he never reclaimed them.  \n\u2018The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the council. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin the History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from the council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he had made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably unobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his executor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes were sent to me as a part of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being handled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily opened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years.\u2019  \nFrom the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825.  \nCol.

            "text": "44 INTRODUCTION  \nCONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK  \nThe two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the \u201cproceedings of the Virginia Company in England\u201d are the contemporary copies of the court book which were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the estate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or later. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have been when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he made a visit to England, that he made the purchase. That the books remained in the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by the fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the third William Byrd, who died in 1777; but these two volumes were not in the library of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac Zane. Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may be accepted; but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when he states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been returned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that Colonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contemporary copies of the court book in his History of Virginia is apparent from his description of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated to him by the \u201clate worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq.\u201d  \n\nMANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III  \nThe other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from Mr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue, belong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr. Jefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of the Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to Mr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of Virginia, he describes in a similar way.  \n\n@ William Byrd died December 4, 1704. See Byrd, History of the Dividing Line.  \nb \u201cCatalogue of the Books in the Library at Westover belonging to William Byrd, Esqr.,\u201d p. 437, in The Writings of Colonel William Byrd, edited by J. S. Bassett.  \nc For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion, pp. 78-84, post.  \n@ It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been acquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton Randolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by Justin Winsor.

            "text": "44 INTRODUCTION  \nCONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK  \nThe two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the \u201cproceedings of the Virginia Company in England\u201d are the contemporary copies of the court book which were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the estate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or later. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have been when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he made a visit to England, that he made the purchase. That the books remained in the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by the fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the third William Byrd, who died in 1777; but these two volumes were not in the library of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac Zane. Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may be accepted; but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when he states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been returned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that Colonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contemporary copies of the court book in his History of Virginia is apparent from his description of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated to him by the \u201clate worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq.\u201d  \n\nMANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III  \nThe other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from Mr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue, belong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr. Jefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of the Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to Mr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of Virginia, he describes in a similar way.  \n\n@ William Byrd died December 4, 1704. See Byrd, History of the Dividing Line.  \nb \u201cCatalogue of the Books in the Library at Westover belonging to William Byrd, Esqr.,\u201d p. 437, in The Writings of Colonel William Byrd, edited by J. S. Bassett.  \nc For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion, pp. 78-84, post.  \n@ It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been acquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton Randolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by Justin Winsor.

            "text": "46 INTRODUCTION  \nThe papers, after almost a century in the Capitol, were in a still more deplorable condition in 1901 than that described by Mr. Stith, but the loose pages have now been carefully and skillfully repaired. The order of contents of the volumes (while not chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the direction of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by the early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts are original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them, by the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of the period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province House was burned in Bacon\u2019s rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch in 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter half of the eighteenth century.  \nThe volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled \u201cLetters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625,\u201d is evidently the one referred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as \u201cthe other side of No. A 42.\u201d This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, called by Hening the \u2018Bland copy.\u201d In pages 1 to 14 of this volume are eighteen letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while pages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. The first group are holographs, but of a secretary or clerk not yet identified. The second are doubtless in the autograph of Edward Sharpless. Both are contemporary copies of the originals. The documents classed in the Jefferson catalogue as 122 (42) form the balance of this volume and also probably include the journal of the council and assembly, 1626-1634. The latter was evidently used by Hening in compiling his statutes.  \nPresuming that this fragile document, which is the only one concerning the company and the colony while controlled by the company, formed one volume, its contents was as follows:  \nNo. A 42:  \n1. (a) Miscellaneous letters from the Privy Council to the governor and council in Virginia in 1623, pp. 1-3. An unknown holograph.  \n(b) Declarations of the condition of the colony and answers thereto in 1623/4, pp. 3-7. An unknown holograph.  \nThis volume of correspondence is cited in the List of Records as the \u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia Company of London, Vol. III, pt. ii,\u201d thus including in Vol. III all of this miscellaneous manuscript material of the company.  \nb Edward Sharpless had been a clerk of the secretary of the colony, Christopher Davison, and succeeded him upon his death in the winter of 1623/4. He remained as acting secretary until his trial on May 20, 1624, for giving copies of the acts of the assembly to the commissioners of the King; John Sotherne then took up his duties.  \nSee Plates, post, Vol. II for illustrations of these holographs, and for evidence as to the autographs.",

Partly the holograph of Edward Sharpless and partly perhaps of Christopher Davison, the secretary of the colony from November, 1621, until his death in the winter of 1623/4. 4. Petitions to the governor and council in Virginia, pp. 58-63. Holographs as of the preceding. 5. A miscellaneous collection of letters between the Privy Council and the Commissioners for Virginia on the one hand and the governor and council in Virginia on the other, in 1625, pp. 68-70; a letter from the Virginia Company of London in 1626, p. 71, and a census of 1624, pp. 71-75. Unknown holographs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume. The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group. The last group of miscellaneous documents agrees in subject with the  \nThis volume is cited in the List of Records, as \u201cMSS.

            "text": "46 INTRODUCTION  \nThe papers, after almost a century in the Capitol, were in a still more deplorable condition in 1901 than that described by Mr. Stith, but the loose pages have now been carefully and skillfully repaired. The order of contents of the volumes (while not chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the direction of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by the early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts are original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them, by the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of the period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province House was burned in Bacon\u2019s rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch in 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter half of the eighteenth century.  \nThe volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled \u201cLetters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625,\u201d is evidently the one referred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as \u201cthe other side of No. A 42.\u201d This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, called by Hening the \u2018Bland copy.\u201d In pages 1 to 14 of this volume are eighteen letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while pages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. The first group are holographs, but of a secretary or clerk not yet identified. The second are doubtless in the autograph of Edward Sharpless. Both are contemporary copies of the originals. The documents classed in the Jefferson catalogue as 122 (42) form the balance of this volume and also probably include the journal of the council and assembly, 1626-1634. The latter was evidently used by Hening in compiling his statutes.  \nPresuming that this fragile document, which is the only one concerning the company and the colony while controlled by the company, formed one volume, its contents was as follows:  \nNo. A 42:  \n1. (a) Miscellaneous letters from the Privy Council to the governor and council in Virginia in 1623, pp. 1-3. An unknown holograph.  \n(b) Declarations of the condition of the colony and answers thereto in 1623/4, pp. 3-7. An unknown holograph.  \nThis volume of correspondence is cited in the List of Records as the \u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia Company of London, Vol. III, pt. ii,\u201d thus including in Vol. III all of this miscellaneous manuscript material of the company.  \nb Edward Sharpless had been a clerk of the secretary of the colony, Christopher Davison, and succeeded him upon his death in the winter of 1623/4. He remained as acting secretary until his trial on May 20, 1624, for giving copies of the acts of the assembly to the commissioners of the King; John Sotherne then took up his duties.  \nSee Plates, post, Vol. II for illustrations of these holographs, and for evidence as to the autographs.",

Unknown holographs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume. The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group.

Unknown holographs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume. The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group.

Unknown holographs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume. The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group.

Partly holographs as above. No. A 42. \u201cThe other side:\u201d 1. (a) Letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625. An unknown holograph. (b) Letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. Holographs of Edward Sharpless. 2. Instructions, commissions, proclamations, orders, warrants, and letters of the governor and captain-general of Virginia and of the assembly, pp. 36-53. Partly the holograph of Edward Sharpless and partly perhaps of Christopher Davison, the secretary of the colony from November, 1621, until his death in the winter of 1623/4. 4. Petitions to the governor and council in Virginia, pp. 58-63. Holographs as of the preceding. 5. A miscellaneous collection of letters between the Privy Council and the Commissioners for Virginia on the one hand and the governor and council in Virginia on the other, in 1625, pp. 68-70; a letter from the Virginia Company of London in 1626, p. 71, and a census of 1624, pp. 71-75. Unknown holographs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume. The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharpless and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group. The last group of miscellaneous documents agrees in subject with the  \nThis volume is cited in the List of Records, as \u201cMSS.

On a fly leaf among the loose papers is inscribed the following: \u201cRecords of W. Claybourne or Claiborne. / Joseph [Jokeg] / Tho Farloue & / Upton gent / Thos. Ba[u]rbag[e] / Clef Con\u00e9.\u201d This may belong to the records of the period after May 14, 1626, when William Claybourne was appointed secretary of the colony by Charles I, or it may have been placed in an earlier volume, or it may indicate that a part at least of the earlier volume was transcribed under his direction. Section B (9) of No. 122 in the Jefferson catalogue, cited as orders from February, 1622, to November, 1627, and including loose pages as late as 1634, is the only octavo manuscript of these records and has been saved from its almost useless condition by repair. That this is the original blotter of the court book of the governor and council in Virginia, containing the original record of suits tried before that body and of orders issued by it, is proved by the hasty and brief entries, giving the volume an entirely different character from those of the carefully elaborated transcripts of the clerks. The records of twenty-three courts held as here given and of the cases considered during the era of the authority of the company, consisting of about forty-five pages of manuscript, are noted in the list of the records of the company, but are not printed in this collection since they may be included more properly in a publication of the \u201cRecords of the Colony.\u201d  \nTHE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS RANDOLPH COPY  \nIt is now certain that at least two copies of the court book existed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, since the so-called John Randolph [of Roanoke] copy has recently come to light. It bears every evidence of being an eighteenth century transcript made from the contemporary copy now in the Library of Congress; the manuscript is of the century following that of the contemporary copy; the order, paragraphing, form of insertion of documents, and material is identical; but the omissions and errors arise from illegibility in the earlier manuscript. The other differences lie in occasional carelessness by the copyist and in the fact that the abbreviations are expanded and the spelling and the capitalization are modernized. The caption of the first volume of this eighteenth century copy is as follows: \u201cThe Ancient Records of this Colony under The Treasurer and Company.\u201d It opens with \u201cA Quarter Court held for Virginia at Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s house in @ The three volumes are in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, but they are so closely associated with the Library of Congress MSS. that they are discussed here rather than under the MSS. of Richmond.",

The final statement is as follows: \u201cThe rest of the Company\u2019s Acts are contained in a Second Volume.\u201d Volume II begins with a court of July 17, 1622, and closes on page 491 with the proceedings of June 7, 1624. It bears the caption, \u201cThe Records of the Company of Virginia, Vol. 2.\u201d Pages 492 to 502 include a list of \u201cThe names of the Adventurers for Virginia, as they were in the Year 1620.\u201d On the inside of the board of this volume is written the name, \u201cSam\u2019l Perkins of Cawson.\u201d There is a third volume of this series of transcripts which is described by Mr. Robinson thus: \u201cThe other volume begins with the first charter to the proprietors of Carolina dated the 24th of March, in the fifteenth year of Charles II, (1663) and ends on page 543 with report of the petition of Philip Laudwell against the Lord Effingham made by the Lords Committees of Trade and Plantations, Dated at the Council Chamber 26th of April 1689.\u201d This document ends on page 530. The volume closes on page 544 with \u201cA Memorial for obtaining a more perfect Rent Roll, & advancing Her Majesty\u2019s Quit Rents in Virginia.\u201d On the first cover is the date, \u201cSep 19, 1759.\u201d Mr. Brown thinks that these copies were made for Colonel Richard Bland from Colonel Byrd\u2019s volumes and passed to Theodorick Bland of the family of Cawson, the grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke, to whom they finally came. He adds that the Byrd volumes went to Mr. Jefferson with the Bland collection, which he bought about 1776, instead of the copies therefrom. Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name \u201cCawson\u201d in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theodorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke. The location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph of Roanoke is known. According to Mr. Brown, John Randolph in a codicil to \u201cSee an account of \u2018Two manuscript volumes now in the Library of Congress, at Washington, D. C.,\u2019 in The Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. 29, April, 1893.\u201d Not to be confused with Sir John Randolph, father of the Peyton Randolph whose library Jefferson says he purchased in 1778.",

It bears the caption, \u201cThe Records of the Company of Virginia, Vol. 2.\u201d Pages 492 to 502 include a list of \u201cThe names of the Adventurers for Virginia, as they were in the Year 1620.\u201d On the inside of the board of this volume is written the name, \u201cSam\u2019l Perkins of Cawson.\u201d There is a third volume of this series of transcripts which is described by Mr. Robinson thus: \u201cThe other volume begins with the first charter to the proprietors of Carolina dated the 24th of March, in the fifteenth year of Charles II, (1663) and ends on page 543 with report of the petition of Philip Laudwell against the Lord Effingham made by the Lords Committees of Trade and Plantations, Dated at the Council Chamber 26th of April 1689.\u201d This document ends on page 530. The volume closes on page 544 with \u201cA Memorial for obtaining a more perfect Rent Roll, & advancing Her Majesty\u2019s Quit Rents in Virginia.\u201d On the first cover is the date, \u201cSep 19, 1759.\u201d Mr. Brown thinks that these copies were made for Colonel Richard Bland from Colonel Byrd\u2019s volumes and passed to Theodorick Bland of the family of Cawson, the grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke, to whom they finally came. He adds that the Byrd volumes went to Mr. Jefferson with the Bland collection, which he bought about 1776, instead of the copies therefrom. Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name \u201cCawson\u201d in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theodorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke. The location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph of Roanoke is known. According to Mr. Brown, John Randolph in a codicil to \u201cSee an account of \u2018Two manuscript volumes now in the Library of Congress, at Washington, D. C.,\u2019 in The Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. 29, April, 1893.\u201d Not to be confused with Sir John Randolph, father of the Peyton Randolph whose library Jefferson says he purchased in 1778.",

It bears the caption, \u201cThe Records of the Company of Virginia, Vol. 2.\u201d Pages 492 to 502 include a list of \u201cThe names of the Adventurers for Virginia, as they were in the Year 1620.\u201d On the inside of the board of this volume is written the name, \u201cSam\u2019l Perkins of Cawson.\u201d There is a third volume of this series of transcripts which is described by Mr. Robinson thus: \u201cThe other volume begins with the first charter to the proprietors of Carolina dated the 24th of March, in the fifteenth year of Charles II, (1663) and ends on page 543 with report of the petition of Philip Laudwell against the Lord Effingham made by the Lords Committees of Trade and Plantations, Dated at the Council Chamber 26th of April 1689.\u201d This document ends on page 530. The volume closes on page 544 with \u201cA Memorial for obtaining a more perfect Rent Roll, & advancing Her Majesty\u2019s Quit Rents in Virginia.\u201d On the first cover is the date, \u201cSep 19, 1759.\u201d Mr. Brown thinks that these copies were made for Colonel Richard Bland from Colonel Byrd\u2019s volumes and passed to Theodorick Bland of the family of Cawson, the grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke, to whom they finally came. He adds that the Byrd volumes went to Mr. Jefferson with the Bland collection, which he bought about 1776, instead of the copies therefrom. Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name \u201cCawson\u201d in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theodorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke. The location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph of Roanoke is known. According to Mr. Brown, John Randolph in a codicil to \u201cSee an account of \u2018Two manuscript volumes now in the Library of Congress, at Washington, D. C.,\u2019 in The Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. 29, April, 1893.\u201d Not to be confused with Sir John Randolph, father of the Peyton Randolph whose library Jefferson says he purchased in 1778.",

The final statement is as follows: \u201cThe rest of the Company\u2019s Acts are contained in a Second Volume.\u201d Volume II begins with a court of July 17, 1622, and closes on page 491 with the proceedings of June 7, 1624. It bears the caption, \u201cThe Records of the Company of Virginia, Vol. 2.\u201d Pages 492 to 502 include a list of \u201cThe names of the Adventurers for Virginia, as they were in the Year 1620.\u201d On the inside of the board of this volume is written the name, \u201cSam\u2019l Perkins of Cawson.\u201d There is a third volume of this series of transcripts which is described by Mr. Robinson thus: \u201cThe other volume begins with the first charter to the proprietors of Carolina dated the 24th of March, in the fifteenth year of Charles II, (1663) and ends on page 543 with report of the petition of Philip Laudwell against the Lord Effingham made by the Lords Committees of Trade and Plantations, Dated at the Council Chamber 26th of April 1689.\u201d This document ends on page 530. The volume closes on page 544 with \u201cA Memorial for obtaining a more perfect Rent Roll, & advancing Her Majesty\u2019s Quit Rents in Virginia.\u201d On the first cover is the date, \u201cSep 19, 1759.\u201d Mr. Brown thinks that these copies were made for Colonel Richard Bland from Colonel Byrd\u2019s volumes and passed to Theodorick Bland of the family of Cawson, the grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke, to whom they finally came. He adds that the Byrd volumes went to Mr. Jefferson with the Bland collection, which he bought about 1776, instead of the copies therefrom. Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name \u201cCawson\u201d in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theodorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke. The location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph of Roanoke is known. According to Mr. Brown, John Randolph in a codicil to \u201cSee an account of \u2018Two manuscript volumes now in the Library of Congress, at Washington, D. C.,\u2019 in The Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. 29, April, 1893.\u201d Not to be confused with Sir John Randolph, father of the Peyton Randolph whose library Jefferson says he purchased in 1778.",

            "text": "50 INTRODUCTION  \nhis will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

            "text": "50 INTRODUCTION  \nhis will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

            "text": "50 INTRODUCTION  \nhis will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

            "text": "50 INTRODUCTION  \nhis will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

            "text": "50 INTRODUCTION  \nhis will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

That the Randolph copy was not made from the original records is evidenced by the fact that the abstracts are identical with those of the Hickman or \u2018Bland\u2019 copy. That both Hening and Burk used the Randolph copies of the court book and also the third volume of that series is proved by their descriptions of the volumes, while the page references to \u2018Ancient Records\u2019 cited by Hening coincide in each case with these three volumes. Mr. Hening speaks of three large folio volumes not in the orthography of the age of the events, and compiled without much regard to method for the purpose of forming material for a history of Virginia, and states that the first two volumes are minutes of the proceedings of the London Company, and the third an epitome of the legislative and judicial acts of authorities in Virginia, so far as then extant, which were regularly transmitted to England. These, he continues, were used by John Burk, who got them from John Randolph, and also by Skelton Jones, 1809, to complete Burk\u2019s History of Virginia. Mr. Burk himself declares that there are two large volumes, instead of three, as stated by Hening, \u2018containing the minutes of the London Company together with the proceedings of the Virginia Councils and Assembly, with little interruption to the middle of the reign of George II.\u2019 \n\nJEFFERSON TRANSCRIPTS \n\nThe three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia Records which came from the Jefferson Library in 1815 are unique, containing copies of records since destroyed. Two of them are attested by R. Hickman, the deputy clerk of the general court in 1722, and the third is the only seventeenth century transcript in our possession. Unlike the Randolph copies, the two large volumes include copies of records since destroyed. Of this group the \u2018First laws made by the assembly in Va. Anno 1623\u2019 bears on the back of the last page the following indorsement in Mr. Jefferson's hand: \u2018This was found among the manuscript papers of Sr. John Randolph and by the Honorable Peyton Randolph, Esq. his son was given to Tho. Jefferson.\u2019 and is attested as follows: \u2018Copia Test R. Hickman DC GC.\u2019 This early eighteenth century transcript was made by the same copyist as were the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, and is the volume used by Hening and referred to in his first volume, pages 121-129. It must also be the subject of a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Hening, April 8, 1815, in which he states that the manuscript marked \u2018A\u2019 contains laws of 1623-24, thirty-five acts, which was given him by Peyton Randolph from the materials used by Sir John Randolph, and which Mr. Jefferson declares to @Hening, Statutes at Large, I, 76 n.

Burk some of the printed laws of Virginia in his possession, since they were unique and could not be replaced. The internal evidence points to the fact that Hening also used the other volumes of this set, a fact corroborated by the following statement of Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Mr. George Watterson, May 7, 1815: \u2018\u201cI gave to Mr. Milligan a note of those folio volumes of the Laws of Virginia belonging to the Library which being in known hands, will be recovered. One is a MS. volume from which a printed copy is now preparing for publication.\u201d Mr. Hening was doubtless using them in the preparation of his later volumes. Certain it is that these documents form the basis for a part of his first volume, in which he cites the Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634, as belonging to Thomas Jefferson, and as having been \u2018purchased by him with the library of Peyton Randolph, from his executors.\u201d The third, the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, he states was bought by Mr. Jefferson \u2018from the executor of Richard Bland, dec\u2019d.\u201d The seventeenth century volume, entitled Instructions, Commissions, letters of Advice and admonitions and Publick Speeches, Proclamations, &c: Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assemblie, is a vellum-covered book, with an embossed figure on the back cover, and with the following: \u2018\u201cE/ 1621/ Publick, Letters / and Orders.\u201d On the outside of the front cover upside down is: \u2018\u201cE/ John Bland | Richard Bland | Alexander Morrison,\u201d while on the half that remains of the first fly leaf is the name \u2018\u201cNelson.\u201d On the fly leaf in the book in pencil is the statement: \u2018\u201cdate of MSS 1650-1695;\u201d and on the front cover similarly is: \u2018\u201c17th Century copie Bland.\u201d This presence of Richard Bland\u2019s name in the book shows that Mr. Jefferson secured it with the Bland Library. The writing of the volume is similar to the early seventeenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double /, and the formation of some of the letters. Evidently this is a collection of correspondence of the colony, transcribed from the court books and from the miscellaneous papers of the three volumes of the manuscript records of the company.

Burk some of the printed laws of Virginia in his possession, since they were unique and could not be replaced. The internal evidence points to the fact that Hening also used the other volumes of this set, a fact corroborated by the following statement of Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Mr. George Watterson, May 7, 1815: \u2018\u201cI gave to Mr. Milligan a note of those folio volumes of the Laws of Virginia belonging to the Library which being in known hands, will be recovered.

The writing of the volume is similar to the early seventeenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double /, and the formation of some of the letters. Evidently this is a collection of correspondence of the colony, transcribed from the court books and from the miscellaneous papers of the three volumes of the manuscript records of the company.

This is an error, since a contemporary copy has been found among the \u2018\u201cfragile papers\u201d in Jefferson\u2019s own possession at the time. bThomas Jefferson to John D. Burk, Monticello, February 21, 1803. eW. D. Johnston, History of the Library of Congress, I, 178. @Hening, Statutes at Large, I, 147, 152, 224.

            "text": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 is in calf and bears on the back the red label, \u201cVirg. Records.\u201d Bound into the back of this volume is a small quarto of twenty-five pages, containing outlines of documents in the Manuscript Records of the Company, which serves to identify the loose pages of the original records as Roll A. 42, and an abstract of Captain Argall\u2019s register during his government. The documents in the folio volume are charters, instructions, commissions, letters from the Privy Council, and other documents emanating from the Crown, together with one or two from the company and from the council in Virginia. That this volume is the one used by Hening in his Statutes and referred to as the \u201cBland copy\u201d is indicated by the contents as well as by the fact that it includes the quarto volume. His reason for citing it as the \u201cBland copy\u201d can only be surmised, namely, that he had Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that it had been secured with the Bland library, an erroneous designation as is proved by Stith\u2019s statement in his preface, that R. Hickman made a copy of the Records for Sir John Randolph. But the volume has been known for the past century as the \u201cBland copy,\u201d although its title as a \u201cHickman\u201d or a \u201cRandolph\u201d volume would be more appropriate. The conclusions which have been formed with regard to these original and contemporary manuscripts and the later transcripts disclose little concerning the circumstances under which they were made, or the original owners of the volumes. But the important facts to discover, in order to determine their authenticity, are the period of the transcript and the documents from which the copies were made, and these facts in each case have been ascertained. The documents there referred to by page are noted in the \u201cList of Records.\u201d The original register of Captain Argall has not been found.

            "text": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 is in calf and bears on the back the red label, \u201cVirg. Records.\u201d Bound into the back of this volume is a small quarto of twenty-five pages, containing outlines of documents in the Manuscript Records of the Company, which serves to identify the loose pages of the original records as Roll A. 42, and an abstract of Captain Argall\u2019s register during his government. The documents in the folio volume are charters, instructions, commissions, letters from the Privy Council, and other documents emanating from the Crown, together with one or two from the company and from the council in Virginia. That this volume is the one used by Hening in his Statutes and referred to as the \u201cBland copy\u201d is indicated by the contents as well as by the fact that it includes the quarto volume. His reason for citing it as the \u201cBland copy\u201d can only be surmised, namely, that he had Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that it had been secured with the Bland library, an erroneous designation as is proved by Stith\u2019s statement in his preface, that R. Hickman made a copy of the Records for Sir John Randolph. But the volume has been known for the past century as the \u201cBland copy,\u201d although its title as a \u201cHickman\u201d or a \u201cRandolph\u201d volume would be more appropriate. The conclusions which have been formed with regard to these original and contemporary manuscripts and the later transcripts disclose little concerning the circumstances under which they were made, or the original owners of the volumes. But the important facts to discover, in order to determine their authenticity, are the period of the transcript and the documents from which the copies were made, and these facts in each case have been ascertained. The documents there referred to by page are noted in the \u201cList of Records.\u201d The original register of Captain Argall has not been found.

In the Lenox branch of the New York Library is to be found a unique set of documents relating to the settlement of Berkeley Hundred in 1619, known as the Smyth of Nibley papers which \u201care from the collection of Virginia manuscripts originally brought together by John Smyth (or Smith) of Nibley, the historian of the Berkeleys, who was born in 1567 and died in 1641. The collection comprises over sixty papers, original and contemporary transcripts, relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and 1634. After passing into the hands of John Smyth the younger, and more recently into the Cholmondeley collection at Condover Hall, Shropshire, the manuscripts were offered for sale in January, 1888, by Mr. Bernard Quaritch, from whom they were lately bought and given to the New York Public Library by Mr. Alexander Maitland.\u201d* With the exception of the manuscripts in the Ferrar collection relating to Smythe\u2019s Hundred, these form the only extant records of the important movement for private plantations in Virginia under the r\u00e9gime of the company. Two other valuable documents are now in the possession of the Lenox Library, the holographic letter of John Pory, secretary of the colony, dated September 30, 1619, and Commissioner John Harvey\u2019s declaration of the State of Virginia in 1624.\n\nCOLLECTIONS OF AMERICANA\n\nThe manuscripts in the Library of Congress, the Smyth of Nibley papers in the New York Public Library, and the patent books in Virginia are the only original records of the company or of the colony previous to 1625 now in America. But there are two public collections of Americana which are extremely valuable for this period: The John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island, which contains only books on America published before the year 1800, and the New York Public Library.\n\n* Quoted from the New York Public Library Bulletin (1897), 1, 68, and (1899), III, 160. \n* List of Records, Nos. 133 and 640.",

            "text": "56 INTRODUCTION  \nIn the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the only documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a division of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by the Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an imperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary pamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has heretofore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch of supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of June 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John Brinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox Library. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled \"Virginia's God be Thanked,\" with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there are copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition to these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing \"The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\" and Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \"A valuation of the commodities growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\" are to be found in the Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox libraries. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by John Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Earl of Southampton, now to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries. The New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter Brown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains two unique publications of the company; the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620, which is the only copy known to the Editor. The other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of the declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King and of the council; Patrick Copland\u2019s \"Virginia\u2019s God be Thanked,\" and his Declaration how the monies were disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse\u2019s Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John Donne\u2019s Sermon, 1622. There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress. \"The Inconveniences\" was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in the Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London. A copy was in the Cholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May, 1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition that it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem valid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page in that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.",

            "text": "56 INTRODUCTION  \nIn the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the only documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a division of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by the Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an imperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary pamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has heretofore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch of supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of June 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John Brinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox Library. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled \"Virginia's God be Thanked,\" with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there are copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition to these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing \"The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\" and Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \"A valuation of the commodities growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\" are to be found in the Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox libraries. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by John Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Earl of Southampton, now to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries. The New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter Brown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains two unique publications of the company; the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620, which is the only copy known to the Editor. The other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of the declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King and of the council; Patrick Copland\u2019s \"Virginia\u2019s God be Thanked,\" and his Declaration how the monies were disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse\u2019s Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John Donne\u2019s Sermon, 1622. There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress. \"The Inconveniences\" was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in the Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London. A copy was in the Cholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May, 1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition that it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem valid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page in that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.",

            "text": "56 INTRODUCTION  \nIn the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the only documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a division of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by the Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an imperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary pamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has heretofore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch of supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of June 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John Brinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox Library. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled \"Virginia's God be Thanked,\" with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there are copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition to these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing \"The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\" and Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \"A valuation of the commodities growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\" are to be found in the Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox libraries. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by John Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Earl of Southampton, now to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries. The New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter Brown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains two unique publications of the company; the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620, which is the only copy known to the Editor. The other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of the declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King and of the council; Patrick Copland\u2019s \"Virginia\u2019s God be Thanked,\" and his Declaration how the monies were disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse\u2019s Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John Donne\u2019s Sermon, 1622. There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress. \"The Inconveniences\" was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in the Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London. A copy was in the Cholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May, 1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition that it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem valid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page in that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.",

            "text": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624  \nMay, 1887, describes such a broadside, which is known to have been purchased by Mr. Kalbfleisch. The second is A Note of the Shipping, etc., sent to Virginia in 1621. The Cholmondeley copy of this also was sold by Mr. Quaritch to Mr. Kalbfleisch. A third copy of the same is in the collection of printed broadsides of the Society of Antiquaries in London. The volumes of printed material relating to the Virginia Company, which are in the Harvard Library, have been mentioned above. Two private collections deserve mention for their comparatively large number of important publications of the company, the private collection in New York and that of Mr. Edward Ayer, in Chicago, Illinois. In addition to twenty other rare publications of the company, Mr. Ayer has a unique book entitled 'Greevoys Grones for the Poore,' 1621. It refers to the Virginia Company in its address only, and in the statement of the number of poor that had been sent to Virginia, but is of value for an understanding of that movement. The other private collection is of about the same size. It contains the duplicate of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox and the only known copy of a four-page tract entitled 'Declaration how the monies were disposed (being) collections for the Grammar Schooles,' by Patrick Copland. In the catalogue of Bernard Quaritch for May, 1887, the broadside of May 17, 1620, and the Note of the Shipping, 1621, are both noted as being unique since each contains the final clause: 'Who-soever transports himself or any other at his own charge unto Virginia, shall for each person so transported before mid-summer, 1625, have to him and his heirs forever 50 acres of land upon a first and 50 acres upon a second division.' A copy of the Note of the Shipping, 1621, in the Cholmondeley collection is similarly described in the fifth report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, page 341. The Quaritch copies were sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch, whose collection went to Mr. Lefferts, and finally through the dealers, Geo. H. Richmond or Dodd, Mead & Co., either to a private collection or to the Lenox Library. But the Lenox copies either do not correspond to these descriptions or were not purchased from Mr. Lefferts. The volumes of the Lefferts collection, which were not sold in America, were sent to Sotheby, England, but Mr. Eames of the New York Public Library states that no early Virginia material was allowed to return to England. The collection of Americana belonging to Mr. Ayer is open to the public through the Newberry Library. For the early Virginia material of the library see Index under 'Ayer, Edward.' This tract is described in the Appendix of the Fifth Report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, as follows: 'A Declaration how the monies, viz., 70\", 8s. 6d., were disposed, which was gathered (by Mr. Patrick Copland, preacher in the Royal James) at the Cape of Good Hope (toward the building of a free schoole in Virginia) of the gentlemen and mariners in the said ship; a list of whose names are under specified, &c. 4\u00b07 pp. Imprinted at London by F. K. 1622.'",

            "text": "58 INTRODUCTION\n\nTRANSCRIPTS IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\nOther attempts have been made to secure resources for research in America. Not only is there the aggregation of excerpts from the English documents in Richmond, as described above, and the acquisition of transcripts in the Library of Congress within recent years, but half a century ago a similar interest was displayed by collectors and historians in New York City, forming three collections which are to-day in the Lenox Library. William H. Aspinwall, a merchant, secured among other papers the Chalmers collection of letters and documents relating to Virginia from 1606 to 1775. They were in turn sold to Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, a lawyer and notable collector of New York City, from whom a part were purchased by the library, while others came to the Lenox with the Bancroft transcripts in 1898. Chalmers had been a clerk in the State paper office and seems to have taken these extracts, outlines, and sometimes full copies from the Plantation office papers, since he continually refers to them in his Politicall Annals. They are modernized transcripts, failing to follow the early orthography, abbreviations, and capitalization. The writing is cramped and often almost illegible, while the table of contents is incomplete and useless. They comprise (1) a series of brief outlines of Privy Council orders; (2) extracts from the Dudley-Carleton papers; (3) outlines of additional Council orders; (4) a calendar of certain of the colonial State papers; (5) outlines of council orders dealing with other trading companies. All of the original documents are at present in the Public Record Office and are noted in the Bibliographical List of Records following. The Bancroft papers relating to Virginia and the Simancas Archives are well bound, clear, and apparently careful, correct, and full copies of the documents included. The first two volumes of the Bancroft collection bearing on the Virginia Company are transcripts of many of the documents in the State paper office, probably made in 1852 by Noel Sainsbury, but the list is not complete. While the peculiar and characteristic signs of abbreviation are not followed, the orthography seems to be accurate throughout. Furthermore, the collection includes the document entire, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents is careful and correct. The \u201cSimancas Archives\u201d is a volume of transcripts of \u201cPapers in the Simancas Archives relating to the History of Virginia and other portions. \n\nSee a statement by Victor H. Paltsits, April 14, 1896, inserted in the first volume of these papers now in the Lenox. The documents transcribed in both the Chalmers-Barlow and the Bancroft volumes are noted in the List of Records under \u201cRemarks.\u201d",

The only document relating to Virginia which is not reproduced in that collection is a repetition of the proclamation of the King of England concerning tobacco, bearing the date November 12, 1624. \n\nCOLLECTIONS IN ENGLAND \n\nFERRAR PAPERS \n\nThe most unique collection in England for the study of the Virginia Company is that in the possession of Magdalen College, Cambridge. As the property of Nicholas and John Ferrar, who were second only to Sir Edwin Sandys in their activity in the company, it would be invaluable; but its importance is further enhanced by the fact that it contains the correspondence and papers of Sir Edwin Sandys himself. These seventy-eight papers, which are either records of the company or vitally concern it, cover the period of the Sandys-Southampton influence from 1617 to the summer of 1623. They were the property of Dr. Peckard, master of Magdalen College in 1790, and were bequeathed to the college upon his death. It is probable that the greater part of the collection came from the Ferrar family through Dr. Peckard\u2019s wife, Martha Ferrar, the great grand-daughter of John Ferrar, since the Virginia papers form but one-third of the group. The remaining papers concern family affairs only, and date from 1601 to the middle of the eighteenth century. Some of them are doubtless those received from the Earl of Dorset by Dr. Peckard, when he was preparing his Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar. \n\nThe first knowledge of the Ferrar papers in later years was communicated to the Virginia Magazine of History by Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Little Gidding, Ealing, England. He sent a number of transcripts and photographs of letters to the magazine for publication, among which were some half dozen bearing on the affairs of the company, but the number which he was permitted to reproduce was limited by the college. While Mr. Ferrar was completing a history of the Ferrar family the entire collection was deposited at his home, and it was therefore in Ealing in the fall of 1903 that the Editor was first permitted by the authorities of the college to \u201csee and note the contents\u201d of the papers. Before the following summer Mr. Ferrar had died and the collection had been returned to Cambridge, where complete transcripts of all letters and photographs of all documents relating to the Virginia Company were made for the Library of Congress under the supervision of the Editor. \n\nIn this work Dr. Peckard states that the Earl of Dorset had had his library searched and had sent him a few loose papers belonging to the Virginia Company.",
