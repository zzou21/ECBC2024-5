It would save excessive wear and tear upon the originals; it would enable the texts to be studied by investigators who cannot come to Washington; and it would encourage that thorough, detailed, and continuing study of them which their value and interest and a proper understanding of American history require. These reasons apply with peculiar force to the Records of the Virginia Company, unique in themselves and unique of their kind, and an additional one, in their case influential; that publication would make them available to persons who would not master the difficult chirography of the original. Their history is fully told in the Introduction by Miss Kingsbury, and their importance as a document emphasized in the Preface by Professor Osgood. Previous efforts to secure their publication extenso had not been successful. The present one originated in a proposal by Professor Osgood in behalf of the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association to edit them as a contribution to one of the Annual Reports of the Association; and although the work as issued is an independent publication of the Library, it has had the benefit of his expert counsel. It was at his instance also that Miss Kingsbury, then a graduate student in his department at Columbia, began the undertaking which she has so well accomplished, and which has consisted (1) in a complete transcript of the text itself; (2) in a close study not merely of this but of the numerous collateral and subsidiary documents both here and abroad; (3) in the preparation of the Introduction, Notes, Bibliography, and Index; and (4) in aid upon the proof.

    "8": "Preface  \nThe records, and especially the Court Book, of the Virginia Company of London have long been regarded as among the most precious manuscript treasures which have found a lodgment within the United States. Not only is their inherent value as an historical source very great, as has been explained by the editor in her introduction, but a sentimental value also attaches to them. This has a twofold origin. It arises, in the first place, from the fact that they belong at once to the romantic period of our own beginnings and to the heroic period of England's great struggle against absolutism. The men who figure in the pages of this record were at the same time playing their parts, on the one side or the other, in the controversies which were then beginning with James I, and which were to broaden and deepen under his son till England was plunged into the agonies of the great civil war. They were contemporaries, and in not a few cases associates, of Coke and Eliot and Hampden, of Bacon and Wentworth and Buckingham. The names of Sandys and the Ferrars stand high on the roll of patriots by which the first generation of the Stuart period is distinguished. These same men also, together with a long list of the merchants and nobles of the time, were deeply interested in discovery and colonization. As successors of Gilbert and Raleigh they were planting a new England beyond the Atlantic. About this enterprise still clung some of the spirit and memories of the Elizabethan seamen and their early struggles with Spain. In the days when Smythe and Sandys were active the prosaic age of English colonization had not yet begun. The glamour of romance, of the heroic, attaches to the founding of Virginia and Plymouth, and makes them fit subjects for the poet. By the time when the other colonies were founded the glow and inspiration had grown faint or wholly disappeared. In the Records of the Virginia Company some reflection may be seen of this early zeal, of the plans and ideals to which it gave rise. Even their pages, cast in a style which is quite unusual in records of this nature, make one realize that he is in the company of noble and earnest spirits, men who were conscious that they were engaged in a great enterprise. The Court Book itself, now that it is printed in full, will be found to be a worthy monument of English speech, as it was used at the close of the Elizabethan epoch and by contemporaries of Shakespeare and Bacon. The fate which probably befell the original of this record, and the unusual steps which it became necessary to take in order to secure and preserve a copy, were natural consequences of the struggles of the time, and add still further to the interest of the narrative.",
    "9": "6 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nthe text as we now possess it. Miss Kingsbury, by her use of the Ferrar papers, has been able to establish by the clearest proof the connection of Nicholas Ferrar with the transcription, and in many other ways she has added definiteness to the accounts usually given of the origin and preservation of the record as we now possess it. The transfer of the copy of the Court Book to Virginia and its transmission from hand to hand till, through the medium of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s library, it finally passed into the possession of Congress fittingly concludes the remarkable history of the preservation of this manuscript. The high estimate which has been placed on its value is evidenced not only by the use that has been made of it by historians, but by the long-continued efforts which have been made to secure its publication. In 1858 Mr. J. Wingate Thornton, in an article in the \u201cHistorical Magazine,\u201d explained the nature of the Court Book, told how it had been preserved, and insisted upon the importance of its being published. \u201cAs these volumes are of national rather than of local interest,\u201d said he, \u201creaching back to the very foundation of the English companies for colonizing America; as they have escaped the chances and mishaps of two centuries, on either side of the Atlantic, and as Providence has now placed them in the keeping of our National Congress, is it not our national duty to have them appropriately edited and published?\u201d The following year Mr. Thornton published a pamphlet in Boston, in which he outlined the history of the manuscript and again raised the question of its publication. But soon the Civil War came on, and plans of that kind, especially so far as they related to southern history, had to be postponed. But in 1868, three years after the close of the war, Mr. Edward D. Neill presented a memorial to Congress, in which he dwelt on the neglect by historians of these most valuable manuscripts. He stated that, while preparing his book entitled \u201cTerra Mariae,\u201d he had familiarized himself with the chirography of the records. He now offered to undertake their editing without compensation, if he might be furnished with two copyists for a limited time and be allowed a small sum for stationery and contingent expenses. But this offer met with no response, and Mr. Neill was forced to content himself with the publication of extracts from the manuscript in his \u201cHistory of the Virginia Company of London\u201d (Albany, 1869). In March, 1877, Mr. Robert A. Brock, of the Virginia Historical Society, published in the \u201cRichmond Daily Dispatch\u201d a \u201cPlea for the Publication of the Records of the Virginia Company.\u201d In 1881 Senator John W. Johnston, of Virginia, introduced into Congress a bill which was intended to provide for the publication of the records. This passed the Senate, but failed in the House. During three successive sessions between the years 1885 and 1888 Dr. J. Franklin Jameson applied to the Library Committee of Congress for permission to edit and publish the records without expense to the Government. His plan was to obtain a sufficient number of subscribers to justify the issue of the volumes by a private firm and to meet the cost of the sale. Another suggestion which he also made was the appointment of a commission which should concern itself with the publishing of",

While occupied with this matter Dr. Jameson explained the history and value of the records to the Rhode Island Historical Society, and his address was reviewed in the \u201cMagazine of American History\u201d (vol. 21, January-June, 1889, p. 82). But meantime some progress had been made with the actual printing of the Court Book. Mr. Conway Robinson had made copious extracts from it, especially of the documentary material which is contained in the second volume. His extracts the Virginia Historical Society published in 1889, under the editorship of Mr. R. A. Brock. Until the present time this edition, in two volumes, has served the purpose of most students. But the requirements of historical study in this country have now reached a point where more complete and critical editions of the sources are needed than have been common in the past. If this need was to be met, it became at once apparent that no body of records was better adapted for a beginning than those which related to the Virginia Company of London. In date and subject matter they stand at the very threshold of American history. In character they form a distinct and unique group of material. By the issue of a definitive edition of these records the demand which scholars have so long made for their publication would be met and satisfied. It was under the influence of considerations like these that the present work was undertaken. \n\nIn the preparation of this body of records for the press critical accuracy and helpfulness have been sought in all possible ways. The spelling of the original has been carefully preserved throughout, for in editing a source of this character and importance any attempt to modernize the text would be properly regarded as unjustifiable. Not only has the spelling been preserved, but also the signs and abbreviations which abound, the use of which the men of the period had inherited from still earlier times. So far as such a thing is possible in print, the text is exactly reproduced in these volumes, while an added element of reality is supplied by the photographs of specimen pages of the original manuscript. \n\nBrief notes have been added where it was necessary to explain or call attention to obscurities, omissions, or other irregularities in the text, the purpose being to enable the reader to gain information of this kind from the printed page with the same certainty as if he were using the manuscript. In the notes, cross references have also been given to the documents of the company and to its publications, when they have been found to reproduce, or to illustrate and make more definite, the statements which are contained in the Court Book. In citations of this kind the number of each document is given as it appears in the List of Records in the Introduction. In this way the unity of the records of the company as a whole receives illustration, and the investigator will be aided in any effort which he may make to learn all which they have to reveal in reference to any subject. Finally, the index completes the invaluable service which Miss Kingsbury has rendered in the editorship of the work.\n\nHersert L. Oscoop\nColumbia UNIVERSITY",

    "13": "The Character of the Company\n\nThe individual effort which had revealed itself at the close of the medieval period in other phases of the economic development and in the military history of the past quarter century was especially prominent in the movement in 1606 for a society of adventurers to trade in Virginia. The commercial advance had been due chiefly to private enterprise, and the naval expeditions into the West Indies against the Spanish had been fitted out and prosecuted by such adventurous spirits as Sir Francis Drake, while the zeal for exploration and for gold, which inspired John and Sebastian Cabot to search for a passage to Cathay and the East Indies in 1498, led Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh a century later to seek out the resources of the lands from Florida to Newfoundland. It is the same spirit of adventure which inspired the narratives of John Smith and Henry Spelman as they told of their relations with the Indians of America. But it is in the progress of both the commercial and the political life of England that the Virginia Company is important. For the plantation founded and nourished by a private concern as an enterprise purely for gain was the social cause from which developed the colony as a form of government. Its political organization is seen in its relations to the Crown, of which there were two distinct phases. During the first three years it was distinctly a creature of the King, the affairs of which were conducted by the King through a council created by himself and responsible to himself, while to the investors were left the privileges of raising the funds, furnishing the supplies, and sending out the expeditions. It was a modification of this form of management to which the government reverted after the dissolution of the Company in 1624, and again at the end of the century when royal colonies were substituted for proprietary and corporate forms throughout America. In the second phase the undertakers became distinctly proprietary, retaining the commercial responsibilities, but assuming governmental functions in place of the King. A comparison between the royal grants for discovery in the sixteenth century and those of the Virginia Company shows that there was an increase in the direct territorial relations between King and subject, a limitation upon monopoly.",
    "14": "12 INTRODUCTION of trade, and a tendency on the part of the Crown to retain directly or indirectly the powers of government. Thus, in the letters patent to Richard Warde, Thomas Ashehurst, and associates in 1501, to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, and to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584, the Crown conferred proprietorship of land with the right to grant it out in fee simple at will. But in 1606 the land was held by the undertakers, and again in 1609 by the adventurers and planters in free and common socage, as of the manor of Greenwich of the county of Kent. Under the first Virginia charter it was granted by the King to those approved by the council; under the second, by the members of the company to anyone who should have adventured a certain sum of money or his person. The fief, distinctly so called in the early charters, for which homage was to be rendered, with no service, however, save that of one-fifth of the gold and silver gained, had disappeared; and the only direct feudal relation with the King which remained arose from the requirement of a per cent of the precious metals. The monopoly of trade by which Warde, Gilbert, and Raleigh were allowed to seize and detain any one who trafficked within two hundred leagues of a settlement was altered in 1606 so that the planters had only the right of collecting a tax from such interlopers. The rights of government which had been surrendered absolutely to the grantees in the sixteenth century charters were reserved to the King by the letters patent of 1606 to be exercised through the council. In 1609 these powers were conferred on the company as an open body, it must be remembered, and thus differed from the earlier grants and from the later proprietary grants to Lord Baltimore or to William Penn. Although the charter emphasizes the government of the plantation, the Virginia Company was purely a commercial enterprise conducted by a private concern, even before the charter of 1609, as is shown by the history of its early years. It was backed by the patronage of the King, but only for the purpose of advancing the trade of the Kingdom in foreign parts and saving the Crown from expense and responsibility, as had been the policy in regard to the other trading companies. Nevertheless, it was a step toward colonial expansion, for, as has well been said, \u201cthe explorer is potentially a colonizer,\u201d and the army of laborers on the plantation became in time an army of free tenants in a colony. While in the spirit of its commercial life the company was closely allied to the efforts for exploration and search for gold, morally supported by Elizabeth in her feudal grants, in its organization, as well as in its purpose, it resembled the private companies for trade based on ancient charters, and in its development is to be understood only through a knowledge of both of these earlier movements.  \n\u00abBiddle, Cabot, Appendix, pp. 312, 314, for this charter.  \nbHakluyt, Principal Navigations, VIII, 17-23, 289-296.  \n\u00a9 Osgood, H.

    "15": "CHARACTER OF THE COMPANY\n\nThus in order to protect trade, but not for exploration and settlement, the ancient charters granted to the Merchant Adventurers in 1407 and 1462, and particularly the one of 1564, incorporated that company into a \u2018Body Politick.\u2019 The words of the grant declared its purpose to be \u2018for the good Government, Rule and Order of the Fellowship of Merchants Adventurers.\u2019 As also of all and every other of the subject of our heirs using the seate of Trade of the said Merchants Adventurers.\u2019 This was also the object expressed in the charter to the East India Company, although it contained an additional provision for the acquisition of lands by purchase. Monopoly of trade and powers of government over factors, masters, or others in the employ of the company were conferred, but the exemption from customs was to continue for only four years, and the only settlements provided for were to have the form of factories. It had been established as a regulated company, that is, one in which each individual invested his own capital subject to the rules of the company; but in 1612 by increasing the importance of the directors and investing sums for a limited period it became a joint stock company. \n\nAs a prototype of the companies later incorporated both for discovery and trade, such as the Virginia Company, the Muscovy or Russian Company, known as the \u2018Merchant Adventurers of England for the discoveries of lands and territories unknown,\u2019 was established in 1555 with a joint stock of \u00a36,000. Sebastian Cabot was appointed governor for life and with him was associated a board of directors of 4 consuls and 24 assistants. However, this company had also the rights of the companies for exploration\u2014that is, those of conquest, of acquiring lands, and of seizing the ships of any who should infringe on their monopoly of trade. \n\nIn 1583 a committee from the Muscovy merchants drew up a set of resolutions concerning a conference with M. Carlile upon his \u2018intended discoverie and attempt into the hithermost parts of America,\u2019 which was not dissimilar to the plan of Sir Walter Raleigh, and hence foreshadowed companies of the seventeenth century. It proposed to send forth 100 men for one year, providing \u00a34,000 for the adventure, in order to gain a \u2018knowledge of the particular estate of the country and gather what commodity. \n\n@Lingelbach, The Merchant Adventurers of England, 218-236 for extracts from the charters.

    "16": "14 INTRODUCTION may hereafter be looked for.\u201d Also, like the Virginia Company, it provided for a joint stock consisting of two groups, one of \u201cadventurers\u201d and one of \u201centerprisers,\u201d each to have one-half of the lands which should be divided among the members by the generality, but all trade was to belong to the adventurers and the corporation was to be closed after the first adventure. The scheme differed from the sixteenth century enterprises, which were especially intended for exploration, in that no question of government was considered, but it conformed to the ideas of Gilbert and Raleigh and of the trading companies, in that its rights over trade were to be purely monopolistic. Apparently this plan of the Muscovy Company stands as a connecting link between the ideas of the explorer and those of the trader and the planter, a plan which may be said to have been carried out by the Virginia Company. It is significant that many of the members of the Virginia Company were men who had taken part in the expeditions of the late sixteenth century and had been interested in certain private voyages of exploration carried on during the five years preceding the receipt of its first charter, while most of the leaders of this company were at the same time stockholders and even officers in the Muscovy Company, the Company of Merchant Adventurers, the East India Company, and later of the Turkey, the Guinea, and the African companies. It is unnecessary to cite the charters of other companies or to search the history of the trading corporations of the sixteenth century in order to show that the Virginia Company was similar in character. But, like the Muscovy Company and the East India Company, it was established to carry on trade in new and uninhabited lands, and hence had the additional features of a company whose purpose was exploration and plantation. The latter characteristic appears more especially in the charter, the former in the instructions and correspondence of the entire period of its life. The object of its first undertakers was doubtless to search for minerals and for a route to the southwest, and to secure for trade the materials which were native and peculiar to those regions. The plantation was a necessity for this purpose, and incidentally, because of the character of the country, it was forced to become a colony. To establish a settlement which should become a market for English goods, to advance the shipping, to spread the religion of the Kingdom were doubtless motives which aroused sympathy for the undertaking; but the arguments which brought investment were the opportunities for gain. The position of the Virginia Company in the development of English exploration and trade was therefore important, and the study of its history is of value not only for the light which it throws on Virginia itself but for an understanding of the economic condition of England as well. Nor is this all. The few private records which remain of the Merchant Adventurers Company and those of the East India.",
    "17": "CHARACTER OF THE COMPANY\n\nThe Company correspond so closely in form and in subject-matter to the court book of the Virginia Company that the similarity in form of organization and methods of conducting business is established. The fact that the private records, the books from which the knowledge of the actual financial transactions could be obtained, are missing in most cases, may prove that their loss in the case of the early Virginia Company is not due to intentional destruction, but to the general opinion of the period that such material was valueless. The only other enterprise of which there is sufficient material for anything like an exhaustive study is the East India Company, and hence its records combine with those of the Virginia Company to supply a source of information concerning all of these companies. The conclusion seems valid, therefore, that the great mass of minutes, orders, instructions, letters, and memoranda of the company for Virginia will aid in the interpretation of the comparatively few records of the earlier associations. The records of this company are necessary to enable one to comprehend the life of the other companies, as is its history to the understanding of their development. \n\nIt was during the life of the company that the plantation gradually assumed the aspects of a colony, that the settlement which was originally planned for exploration and the discovery of gold became a center for the development of the natural and agricultural resources of the surrounding country. The origin within the colony of the assembly, of local government, of private ownership of land, and of freedom of trade is to be found before the dissolution of the company by the Crown. Therefore the records of the company, as well as those of the colony, form the material through which the history of the beginnings of English colonies, viewed from the standpoint of the colonist, is to be gained. \n\nTheir value for the comprehension of the development of political institutions in England is not so patent. The growing correspondence between the Crown and the company and the interference in the acts of the company stand as evidence of the gradual increase of the interest of the Crown or its council in the undertaking. This interest was most apparent when the tobacco trade promised a revenue to the Crown, but the encouragement of the growth of other staple products, the spasmodic revival of acts touching English shipping and the balance of trade, and the maintenance of staple ports in England are all new activities appearing in the records of the company. Throughout, also, is apparent the readiness to allow the already uncertain economic policy to be altered or nullified by the political relations with Spain, or because of moral or whimsical views. \n\nThe gradual definition of policy on the part of the Stuarts, perhaps first apparent under Charles I, is closely connected with the leaders of the Virginia Company. The opinions expressed in the courts of the company by the adherents both of the Puritan party and of the party of the Crown, the correspondence between the Privy Council.",
    "18": "16 INTRODUCTION and the company, the letters and memoranda concerning the company and its policy, and the story of the formation of the Sandys and the Warwick factions, resulting in the dissolution of the company, furnish evidence of the gradual development of the despotic attitude of the Stuarts, especially in their reach for revenue and in their repression of the principles of freedom. The appointment of the commissions to investigate the affairs of the company and the condition of the colony, the creation of a commission for the control of the colony after the overthrow of the charter, the later appointment of a committee of the Privy Council for the same purpose are all steps in the growth of a colonial system and of a colonial policy. Although the maturity of this system and policy is not reached until after the Commonwealth, the influence of the associates of James I and of Charles I is apparent. Every phase of colonial development, from the mixed system which existed under the patent of 1606 to the chartered proprietary company after 1609 and the royal province after 1624, is here illustrated. The transition from the chartered to the Royal Government in 1624, the prelude to \u201cthe most important transition in American history previous to the colonial revolt,\u201d is only to be understood from these records, since the tendency to self-government in the colony is one of the pretended reasons for the overthrow of the company. All the steps of the change are to be traced in the royal correspondence, in the memoranda of the royal party, and in the record of the suit under the writ of quo warranto. The significance of such material is best understood from the fact that \u201cthe constitutional law and practice of the old colonial system has not yet been attempted to be known,\u201d and as yet no book has been written concerning the forms or functions of the British Government as employed in colonial administration.",
    "19": "The Records of the Company under Sir Thomas Smith\n\nTHE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AS IN 1606\n\nIn the year preceding the grant of a charter to the Virginia Company there had been movements along two lines for establishing plantations in Virginia, one by private investment and the other by royal patronage. Examples of the private interests are the enterprise of the Earl of Southampton in 1605 and that of Lord Zouch as set forth in his contract with Captain George Waymouth of October 30, 1605. In this Lord Zouch agreed to secure and provide two ships and 200 men of \u201carts suitable for a colony,\u201d and to pay \u00a3100 to Captain Waymouth for the transportation of the same. The interesting feature is the agreement, suggestive of feudal relations, that Lord Zouch should be the first officer and have the first choice of land, while Captain Waymouth as second officer should have second choice of land, which he was to hold from the former as lord paramount for himself, his heirs and assigns. At the same time Sir John Popham was busily engaged in the attempt to form royal colonies by obtaining charters from the Crown, whereby the territory from 34\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude should be taken under the protection of the King, and private settlements should thus be excluded. The plan which obtained followed neither course, though it was bound to result in a modification of Popham\u2019s scheme. The motives of the grantees and the arguments which induced the King in 1606 to abandon the policy of Elizabeth and to give royal patronage to the undertaking, and even to assume royal control, are set forth in a petition presented to Parliament in 1606, entitled \u201cReasons for raising a publique stocke to be imploied in the discovering of such countries as may be found most convenient.\u201d It is evident, however, that the unknown plan of investment in the adventure of 1606 is not here suggested, since there was no intimation of financial support by the King.

To the Kingdom and to the Crown were to redound the greatest gain. Ten thousand pounds a year were to be added to His Majesty\u2019s receipts by an increase of many thousand pounds in the imposts and customs; and furthermore it \u201cwould savour too much of affectation of a popular State to levie monies without imparting some convenient portion to his Majestie.\u201d But the value to shipping was emphasized perhaps more vigorously as developing a defence to the island, as furnishing a source for the necessities for ships\u2014cordage, pitch, tar, and resin\u2014and as protecting the shipping from decay. The desirability of a revival of the declining export trade, as well as that of establishing the importation of necessities from a part of the dominions, though distant, was urged, together with the importance of strengthening by settlement those countries already acquired by discovery. That such undertakings by private enterprise had been failures; that it was more honorable for the State to back an exploitation by public consent than by private monopoly; that public colonies were bound to be more obedient and industrious because of the greater confidence in the character of the control, were all reasons which had long before been set forth whereby to gain the support of the Crown.  \nCHARTER OF 1606.  \nThe royal aid as finally obtained for a colonial enterprise came in a somewhat different form. The letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates and others for plantations to be made in Virginia show that the investment was made solely by individuals, and that the joint stock was not public, although in the regulation of affairs in the colony the body of undertakers was to have little influence, even as far as its commercial interests in the plantation were concerned. The business management was left to the joint stock companies, and the magazine was controlled by a treasurer or cape merchant and by two clerks elected by the President and Council in the Colony. In fact, the only activity of the adventurers, so far as it is revealed in the extant documents, consisted in the choice in London of one or more groups of agents, called \u201ccompanies,\u201d to manage the goods sent out and received and to look after the profits. The undertakers were to have all lands with their resources.  \na For a reprint of the letters patent, see Brown, Genesis, I, 52-62, or Poore\u2019s Constitutions.  \nb Articles, Instructions and Orders for the government of the Colonies, November 20, 1606.

The right freely to transport subjects was granted the investors, while they were permitted customs free for seven years to export armor, provisions, and all necessities of life for the colonists. They could impose upon any subjects of the Crown, who were not adventurers, trafficking in those regions, a tax of 24 per cent of the articles concerned, and upon foreigners twice that amount, and thus maintain a control of the trade for twenty-one years. But the government of the colonies and of the territory of Virginia was reserved to the Crown through the council of thirteen for Virginia, which was to be appointed by the King and to reside in England. Instructions were issued and signed by the royal hand, which outlined the form of administering affairs in the settlement and created a council of thirteen in the colony. They conferred upon it the right to coin money and to pass ordinances which should be valid till altered by the Crown, provided that they should be consonant with the laws of England. This council in Virginia was to choose its own president for one year. It could remove him or any member for just cause and fill the vacancies. All civil causes and all lesser criminal cases were to be decided by the president and council, the former having two votes in case of a tie. Cases of manslaughter and the more heinous crimes were to be tried before a jury and were punishable with death. To the president and council was reserved the right of pardon. The council in England nominated to the Crown the persons to whom lands were to be granted by the King. It had, in fact, the supervision of affairs, appointed the first council in Virginia, issued orders for the conduct of the first expedition under Captain Newport, and provided a paper of advice as to the establishment of a fort and of a town. It is in this latter document that the first indication of the real motive of the undertaking is found.

The loss of the records, both of the council and of the \"companies\" for trade, covering this period, leaves, as the only source of information, both for affairs in England and in Virginia, the narratives of the early settlers. Of these the most important are the reports of Captain Newport, and the relations of John Smith, of Edward Maria Wingfield, and of George Percy.* The council had dispatched three expeditions, all under Captain Newport; one in December, 1606, in three ships with 120 emigrants; another in October, 1607, with two vessels and about the same number of passengers; and a third in August of 1608 with about 70 emigrants. The reports of Newport, Percy, Wingfield, and Smith encouraged the managers of the enterprise to continue their efforts, but proved that a change in object as well as in policy would be necessary. From Newport came descriptions of the fruitful- ness of the soil, of the quantities of fish and of timber, and of clay for making brick, and enumerations of the possible exports, comprising sturgeon, clapboard, wainscot, saxafrage, tobacco, dyes, furs, pitch, resin, turpentine, oils, wines, wood and soap ashes, iron, copper, pearls; but the reports as to the mines were vague. He declared that the country was rich in gold and copper, and took home with him earth to be assayed, while Smith, in A True Relation, states that he had been left to dig a rock which Captain Newport thought was a mine, but no mention of results is made. The full description of the country by Newport and also by Captain John Smith gave the council a clear idea of its geography, as is indicated by the instructions to Sir Thomas Gates in 1609. But the expedition, which penetrated to a distance of 160 miles up the river, brought the explorers to hostile tribes and left the council still uncertain, though hopeful of the discovery of a passage to the south sea. Furthermore, Captain Newport positively stated that there could be no commerce with the Indians, and all evidence shows that the natives were to be a resource for the necessities of life rather than for the exchange of lucrative objects of trade. Hence it is that the broadside which was issued by the company in 1609, as an incident of its *See John Smith, A True Relation, 1608, reprinted in Arber, Works of John Smith, 1884; Discourse of Virginia, by Edward Maria Wingfield, printed in the Archaeologia Americana, IV, 77-103; Observations gathered out of a Discourse of the Plantation in Virginia 1606, by George Percy, printed in Brown, Genesis, I, 152-168; and the following documents probably written by Captain Archer: A Relation of the Discovery of Our River, from James Forte into the maine: by Capt.

But the effort to develop the resources of the country and to found a settlement for such purposes rather than for exploration required larger investments and more men. Then, too, the regulation of the affairs of the colony without any control from the council in England meant continued jealousies and quarrels among such a small number of colonists and under such unsettled conditions. According to Wingfield the provisions for defense seem to have been insufficient, the magazine was mismanaged, and the relations with the Indians were strained. To John Smith must be attributed the wisdom of foreseeing the necessity of strong support from England and of the establishment of permanent colonial settlements and the development of the country for self-support. \n\nTHE CHANGE IN CHARACTER FROM 1606 TO 1609 The fact that the source of authority before 1609 was in the Crown is nowhere so clearly evidenced as in the records themselves. The fundamental documents emanated from the King and his Council or from the council for Virginia representing the royal authority, all instructions to officers bore the sign manual and all letters and reports from Captain Newport, from Edward-Maria Wingfield, and from his associates were addressed to the council for Virginia. Furthermore, the president and council appeared in the name of the Crown as the plaintiffs in a suit by which an attempt was made to enforce the contract with the master of the \u201cGift of God\u201d for supplying provisions to the passengers in a voyage to North Virginia. The direct relations of the planters to the Crown are similarly emphasized by two heretofore unpublished documents, which are in the Library of Congress, consisting of the oaths administered to the colonists and to the secretary of the colony. \n\nThe commercial status of the undertaking is more difficult to determine than the political. That the company was organized for the purpose of exploration and trade has been proved, but whether the control of trade was vested in the council or in companies or groups of undertakers is uncertain. The exact relation of the council to the plantation and of the Crown to the enterprise must have been stated in the \n\nFor a history of the organization of the company and of the founding of the colony, see Osgood, I, Chs. i-iv.

This book, covering the period from the 28th of January, 1606, to the 14th of February, 1615, was in the possession of the company as late as 1623, but unfortunately no trace of the book has yet been discovered and even its existence has heretofore been unknown. Whatever may have been the source of control, the narrations of Captain Percy, Edward-Maria Wingfield, and Captain Newport indicate that the business of the company consisted chiefly in raising funds and equipping expeditions to be sent to Virginia under Captain Newport. This failure of the investment to bring in returns of gold and silver and of articles for trade, or to accomplish anything in the way of discovery of trade routes to the East Indies during the first three years, served to convince both King and undertakers that a change in method of control was essential. The document known as \u201cReasons against publishing the Kings title to Virginia. A justification for planting Virginia\u201d seems to show an agitation among the investors arising from fear lest the desire to placate Spain, or religious considerations, might lead the Crown to abandon the scheme. The arguments there adduced may well explain the readiness of the King to surrender not only the commercial and territorial control but also full rights of government to the corporate body of the Virginia company, and thus to avoid any rupture with Spain. Certain it is that the desire for more direct authority and for securing larger investments were the motives of the petitioners in asking for a new charter. As a result of this movement the letters patent of 1609 were issued, transforming the undertakers into a body politic. In this case also the documents are especially characteristic of the organization. Whereas the Crown was formerly the source of all power, beginning with 1609 the council of the company, acting as a standing committee for the adventurers rather than in the name of the King, exercised the controlling authority. After the charter of 1612 had provided for more frequent meetings of the generality, the council was gradually superseded by special committees and the tendency arose to decide all matters of importance in the general quarter courts and to insist upon all communications being addressed to the company rather than to the council. The act of incorporation erected a commercial company and made it the overlord of a proprietary province. It at once strengthened its plantation as a center for traffic and established a system for joint management of land and trade to extend over a period of seven years.  \n\u201cWhen the Privy Council demanded the records of the company, a receipt bearing the date April 21, 1623, was given to the secretary of the company for the \u2018several court books.\u2019 This document was discovered by the Editor among the Ferrar papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, in December, 1903.

The records of the corporation reveal as clearly as do its broadsides and pamphlets that it was a business venture. These records may be grouped into seven classes. \n\nTHE CLASSES OF RECORDS \n\nI. The fundamental documents of the company were those by virtue of which it had its legal formation, and consisted of the letters patent, charters, and orders in council issued by the King and Privy Council. \n\nII. The activity of the adventurers was recorded in the court books, which comprised the minutes of the transactions of the company. In those books were kept the discussions and decisions with regard to the plantation, the granting of land, and all financial policies and plans for developing the enterprise and increasing the income. \n\nIII. In carrying on its business the company gave commissions to the governors of the colony, issued regulations for the settlers, and, from time to time, sent instructions to the governor and council of the colony. It also granted lands and patents, entered into contracts, issued receipts, made pleas in court, and kept statements of accounts. \n\nIV. From the colony itself came reports, declarations, letters, and complaints. They were an essential part of the records of the company and often determined its course of action. \n\nV. To the public, for the purpose of inspiring confidence, securing adventurers, and maintaining the interest and support of its members, as well as of defending itself against the accusations of its enemies, the company issued advertisements, broadsides of its shipping investments, declarations, pamphlets, and sermons. \n\nVI. A large part of the information which came to the company was derived from private correspondence between members of the company and individual planters. Furthermore, there was a gradual tendency to permit individuals or groups of individuals of the company to form stock companies for trade or plantation, and records of these transactions formed a valuable supplement to those of the company itself. \n\nVII. To the student of history another group of supplementary material is of great value. It comes from the records of contemporary companies, corporations, and towns, as well as from the correspondence of officers of state or of other persons who were not directly concerned in the transactions of the Virginia Company. \n\nFor the documents in these various classes, see the classifications by Roman numerals at the left of each entry under the \u201cList of Records,\u201d post, pp. 121-205.",

In both instances the protection desired was granted.  \n\nWhen the financial stringency forced the adventurers to great efforts in 1614, and they appealed unsuccessfully to Parliament for aid, the Privy Council attempted to arouse confidence in the undertaking throughout the country. It passed orders urging the city companies of London to invest sums in the Virginia lottery, and in the following year it addressed similar orders to the \u201cSeveral Cities and Townes of the Kingdome,\u201d with special letters to the lieutenants of County Surrey. But the aid thus secured was not such as to draw upon the resources of the Crown, and the attempt of members of the company to gain a monopoly of the tobacco trade in 1616 met with the same opposition as had similar efforts on the part of the merchant adventurers in previous years.  \n\nOn the other hand, the company was compelled to seek new avenues of revenue.  \n\n@For the documents of the period from 1606-1609 not mentioned by Mr. Brown in his Genesis of the United States, most of which have recently been discovered, see List of the Records of the Virginia Company, post, pp. 121-125, Nos. 1-38.  \n\nIn March, 1619, Abraham and John Jacobs received a grant for the collection of customs or imports on tobacco. This became an important feature of the business of the company in its later procedure.

That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 2, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were \u201cother perticuler writings belonging to the company.\u201d The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington. The contents of the \u201cother perticuler writings,\u201d none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a \u201cbooke of perticulers\u201d containing the \u201cPublic workes: done in Sr. T. Smithes tyme,\u201d and showing \u201cthe plenty of Armes &c left in Sr. Th.

To supply the loss of these documents of the company, both during the control of the council and after that control had passed into the hands of the company by virtue of the charter of 1612, there is a considerable mass of material, which affords a fair outline of the transactions of the company and the life of the colony. But much of this information is lacking in the completeness and authenticity which would have been supplied by the court book and the other records. The greatest loss is perhaps that of definite knowledge concerning the financial status of the company. The sums adventured by individuals and corporations is preserved in two alphabetical lists; but, so far as is known, only one of these lists is official, and that includes the names of the particular adventure about the year 1610. The other is an unpublished list apparently both incomplete and unofficial, and was probably made somewhat later than 1618 at the order of the court, although the date 1618 has been assigned to it in the Manchester papers, where it is to be found. From the records of the various London companies and from records of English towns, as also from adventures sealed to individuals by the Virginia Company, comes the most authentic information concerning the large sums invested during this decade. In a similar way the knowledge, otherwise to be found in the court book and \u2018The particulars of the Boates,\u2019 concerning the ships dispatched and the sums expended for the equipment of planters, individuals, and companies, is scattering and indefinite. The broadsides issued are calls for adventurers, planters, and colonists, with the requirements or statements concerning the lottery schemes; but they do not furnish the wide information which is found in those of the later period. So far as revenue is concerned, there was probably little except that which came from new adventurers. This paper is evidently a series of rough notes of heads and references to prove charges of mismanagement by the Sandys faction. It is in the handwriting of Sir N. Rich.

Even our knowledge as to the economic condition of the colony is most indefinite and comes only from printed pamphlets issued by the company. Judging from the sources of information in the later period, this uncertainty is due to the disappearance of the letters themselves, since, after 1619, the published relations of individual planters, the declarations by the company, and even the records of the court books are all more general in character than the letters which were sent from the colony to the company. Furthermore, in the later period the daily acts of the colonists and their needs, as reported from time to time by returning ships, afforded the adventurers a body of information concerning the social condition of the colony which in form and accuracy left little to be desired. After the time of Captain John Smith not much was accurately known of the colony until the year 1617, when Captain John Rolfe and Ralph Hamor supplied statistics as to the numbers, condition, settlements, and resources of the colony as it then was. The individual enterprises of this decade in the life of the company are altogether unknown, except from a few contracts for shipping found here and there. Such movements must at least have been noted in the court book. Of the first \u201chundred,\u201d established in 1618, nothing is recorded except the single report, heretofore unknown, of a meeting of the committee for Smythes Hundred. But the greatest loss which we suffer through the disappearance of the court book is that of material which should throw light on the aims, motives, and unsuccessful efforts of the company and on the struggles and difficulties through which it passed. For example, there is a single reference to an attempt to found a college, but no information whatever on the subject. The factions which developed and which resulted finally in the dissolution of the company evidently existed in this period, for a letter from Chamberlain to Carleton, dated May 8, 1619, in which he speaks of the failure to reelect Sir Thomas Smythe as treasurer of the Virginia Company as having been \u201csomewhat bettered at a later meeting of the Summers Island Company by his choice as treasurer of that company,\u201d proves that the change was due to factional differences, although the extant court books open with the refusal of Sir Thomas Smythe to continue as treasurer.

They include the first instructions ever given to a governor of a colony by an English administrative body, and the records of the first suits entered by the company in chancery for the purpose of enforcing the payments of sums adventured in the company and of securing a part of the income from the lottery, which the company claimed had been withheld by the agent, William Leveson.?  \n\nThe knowledge which the administrators of the affairs of the company had gained from the early settlers, and their grasp of the necessities for exploration, for trade, and for the conduct of affairs in the plantation, has hitherto been a matter of surmise based on the relations of the planters.

The company had become convinced that the policy of John Smith was a wise one, and hence it ordered that a number of plantations should be settled and that efforts should be immediately directed to building healthful and sufficient houses and to planting widely enough for the self-support of the community. Here was the germ which was to develop into the colony, but the plan was as yet by no means so far-reaching. A common store, a common magazine, common refectories, labor by groups with a superintendent for each five or six persons, the prohibition of trade with the Indians except through the truck merchant were economic methods which looked to the gain of the adventurer in London rather than to the development of a colonial settlement. When the settlers had become self-supporting and capable of defense, then measures were to be taken to provide returns, so \u201cthat our fleetes come not home empty.\u201d Discovery of the seas and of royal mines, exchange of commodities, the exaction of tribute, and the development of the resources of the country for the purpose of securing \u201cwines, pitche, Tarre, sope-ashes, Steele, Iron, Pipestaues, hempe, flaxe,\u201d silk grass, fishing for pearls, cod, and sturgeon were to be the sources of revenue. The instructions placed authority implicitly in the hands of the governor, who was expected to hear, but not necessarily to heed, the advice of the council and to judge according to \u201cnaturall right and equity then vppon the nicenes of the lawe.\u201d The agents of the corporation\u2014the governor and his council in Virginia\u2014received their authorization for the exercise of judicial as well as legislative powers through a commission.

With the exception of a set of \u201cInstructions for such things as are to be sente from Virginia, 1610,\u201d these orders and commissions are the only documents which show anything of the direct authority exercised by the company over affairs in the plantation until the issue of the \u201cGreat Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes\u201d in November, 1618. Otherwise, the whole course of the activity of the company under Sir Thomas Smythe was in strong contrast with the work of Sir Edwin Sandys. It was a care on the part of the company is also seen in the general instructions of 1609 to the lieutenant-governor of Virginia, which are known only through a copy of the sixth article, preserved in the papers of the Marquis of Lansdowne. The commission bears the date February 28, 1610. It is printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 376-384. Printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 384-386. This set of instructions to Governor George Yeardley, although given late in 1618, belongs both in spirit and effect to the period of the Sandys-Southampton administration.",

The problem of marketing the products of the colony, which concerned the later company, did not arise until toward the close of the period, when a single unsuccessful effort was made to gain a monopoly of the sale of tobacco. In order to increase the capital stock, the company made personal appeals and issued printed statements and descriptions which it scattered broadly. The story is told in the lists of adventurers cited above, in the earnest endeavors to secure new planters and new adventures from individual town and guild, in the efforts to enforce the payment of sums already adventured, in a few receipts concerning tobacco, in the lottery schemes, which were legalized by the charter of 1612, and in printed broadsides and declarations. Thus the sums adventured by individuals, by the various London companies, and by the towns of England are given in a series of requests for adventure and in bills of adventure issued by the company and found in the records of those companies and towns; as also in private collections. The chancery proceedings, in three suits, state that the company attempted to secure an adventure of \u00a318,000 and the equipment of 600 men during the year 1611, and the failure to accomplish its purpose was set forth by the defendants as a reason for refusing to pay the sums adventured. Incidentally there was mentioned an income in the year 1613 of \u00a38,000 from the lottery, of \u00a32,000 from the sale of the Somers Islands, and of \u00a3600 or \u00a3800 from the disposal of the ship De La Warr. However, with the exception of an unpublished letter from Sandys to the mayor of Sandwich concerning the adventure by that town, in which he inclosed a list of the subscribers to that particular adventure, with the sums set down by each, the official records reveal but little as to the sums which must have been received by the company. In a similar manner there are unauthentic records of economic value concerning the lotteries and the importation of tobacco. Of the latter a few receipts and memoranda among the papers of Lord Sackville and the Earl De La Warr are positively \n\n*For the text of these adventures, see Brown, Genesis, I, 238, 252-3, 308, 391-2 (has signature of secretary and seal of company), 452-3, 453-4, 461-2, 463-5; II, 496 (signature and seal), 555.

Of the former, there is a \u201cDeclaration for the Lottery,\u201d published in 1615 by the company, and an order of the Privy Council, together with letters urging the towns of the Kingdom to adventure in this the second great lottery of the company.* A letter from the governor of the Virginia Company to the mayor and aldermen of Ipswich is to the same effect, but none of these documents tell of the income therefrom. The only record which will give an idea of the value of the first lottery is in the chancery proceedings, and relates to a suit of the company with William Leveson to secure moneys from the lottery, in which the sum received in 1613 is here stated to have been \u00a32,793 and 10 shillings.

The broadside of February, 1611, is of most value, in that the classes of emigrants with the numbers of each desired are specified, while that of 1610 is a defense against the slander of recently returned colonists, and emphasizes the former need of artificers as colonists. The broadsides of 1613 and 1615 concern the drawing of the lotteries, the latter declaring in a general way the prosperous condition of the country and announcing the prizes and rewards, thus affording some conception of the sums received from such an enterprise. The publications of the year 1616 disclose, as well as assert, the prosperity of the settlement and the assurance of its success, though giving no statistical information. That of April arranges for the first division of lands among old adventurers and promises the same to new adventurers. \n\n*Brown, Genesis, II, 760-766.

In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the company, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concerning the colony, which were published by the company.

A True and sincere declaration further explains the unsatisfactory condition of the colony by reference to the incompetence of previous governors, furnishing perhaps the best historical narrative which was issued by the company during the first period of the plantation. It also holds out the promise of improved conditions under Gates and De La Warr, who are to be shortly sent to Virginia with a complete outfit of men and provisions. The second document describes the southern part of the country and cites the advantages of Florida as evidence of the opportunities in Virginia. After the time of De La Warr the published accounts of the plans, movements, and successes of the colonists became more complete. While the statements of De La Warr in his Relation are a bare outline of the conditions as he found them and the improvements in trade and discovery to which Captain Argall had contributed, together with his lordship\u2019s plans for the future, it is of value as forming, with Hamor\u2019s narrative four years later, a surprisingly accurate and satisfactory treatment of the development in the colony during those years. Hamor gives a clear statement of the methods and success of Captain Dale in his relations with the Indians, of his organization and reform of the colony, and of his establishment of order therein, and reveals clearly the state of affairs on the arrival of Gates, the cause of the failure heretofore, and the details of the building of the successive towns, with descriptions and statistics for each. He gives also a historical narrative of the relations with the various Indian tribes and his knowledge and statements concerning the resources of the country are equally satisfactory. While Whittaker\u2019s Good Newes from Virginia and The New Life of Virginea are of value as corroborative evidence, they add but little to the knowledge of conditions or resources, and evidently were written more in the spirit of the poem of 1610, being intended to inspire confidence in the management of the colony, in the new system, and in the officers installed, as well as to arouse enthusiasm in the project. It is evident that these publications are of more direct value in the study of the progress of the colony and tell at first hand but little more than the methods employed by the company to gain its end, but, together with the other reports from the colony which are preserved in manuscript form, they to an extent supply what has been lost by the disappearance of the court book. They prove that there was a gradual change in the motive and means of the company, due entirely to the exigencies of the case. The failure to discover precious metals forced the",

Then, too, the first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610-1612, martial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the company now proposed; the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a minimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and the produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early settlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall, like Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the Indians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted in the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south, which became self-supporting and independent of the \"supplies\" from England. This meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward the colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be abandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family had been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had been sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent. Whether the company made any resistance to this development within the settlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter, will only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain that by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They had then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of the produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the monopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619, when the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most eagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys, by this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House committee which reported against monopolies. To such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir George Yeardley in November, 1618, called \"The Great Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes,\" recognized the necessity for local government. They provided for two houses, the \"Council of State,\" to be chosen by the company in its quarter court, and the general assembly, to consist \"of the Council of State and two Burgesses.\" For the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall, &c., entered for publication on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by the lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611.

The great difference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular sentiment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of administration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u201copposition\u201d in parliament cannot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. \n\nIV.\u2014LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY \n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from individuals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve conditions. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown, especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were \n\n[List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.] There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619.

The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \"A Register book during the Governorship of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for the time present, principal Governor of Virginia\" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long contest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period. \n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe, addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134-138.

His contracts were made in May, 1618, with John Bargrave and James Brett. There is also his warrant to John Fenner to pass to Virginia and trade with the colony and the savages in his pinnace Silver Falcon, in February, 1618/19. The other series of documents, which illustrate the legal forms and methods of the company, as also the way in which the first plantations were undertaken by private means, concern Smythe\u2019s Hundred and Berkeley Hundred. Among the Ferrar papers are the minutes of the meeting of the committee for Smythe\u2019s Hundred on May 8, 1618, the first record concerning the hundred, which provides for the sending out and equipment of thirty-five men at an expense of \u00a3657 9s. 4d. \n\nVII.\u2014SUPPLEMENTARY CONTEMPORARY CORRESPONDENCE AND RECORDS  \nIn addition to the documents which are either official records or similar to such records in character, there is a large amount of correspondence between officers of state in England and other individuals which by its reference throws light on the affairs of the company or gives additional or corroborative data. All of this which is earlier in date than 1616 has been published by Alexander Brown. There are seven letters, the dates of which fall between 1616 and 1619, that are of the same character; but they add nothing in fact to the other documents, although two of them reveal the measures taken even at this early date to impress youths and maidens for Virginia and to send reprieved prisoners to the colony. Of the documents of this character, which are given by Brown, perhaps the correspondence between the Spanish ambassador in London and the King of Spain is the most valuable, not in the trustworthiness of the data\u2014though much of it confirms other sources\u2014but in the revelation it contains of the part that Spanish relations played in the development of the company and especially in its decline during the following decade, while its reference to prevalent rumors, reports, and sentiment are extremely illuminating. There are thirty-seven of these documents in all, including the correspondence concerning the Spanish ship Chaloner.

The Collections of Documents, 1616-1624  \nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE RECORDS  \nThe character of the documents of the company after 1619 is fundamentally the same as in the preceding decade. Virginia was still a proprietary province with a commercial company as an overlord, and therefore the company was still the immediate source of all government in the colony. To it came all appeals from colonial authorities; it exercised control over all commerce, both from and to Virginia; it granted all land and all privileges. Although the number of documents emanating from the Crown \u2014 that is, of the first class \u2014 is large, they are rather an indication of the increasing wealth and importance of the company, than of royal interference. They concern the regulation of trade, complain of the abuse of power by the company, or provide for the investigation of its acts rather than assume any authority in the direct administration of its affairs. In them interference in the management is foreshadowed, but it is not until the dissolution of the company that the Crown again becomes the proprietor. The mass of materials which form the records for this period is much greater than in the earlier decade. This is due on the one hand to their preservation in two or three collections, and on the other especially to the vast growth of business in the company and the rapid development from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement. Thus the minutes of the company, forming the second class of documents, show that it conducted a larger amount of business than any other proprietary company. These minutes comprise two large volumes of the court book, and fill 741 manuscript pages. In the third class there are nine letters from the company to the governor and council in the colony, and twelve from the latter body to the company, in addition to a large number of receipts, commissions, instructions, and laws. A mass of material belonging distinctly to the plantation serves as a part of the records of the  \n@ See documents under Class I in the List of Records.  \n> For this statement, as also for a full understanding of the character of the company, see Osgood, The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century, I, 61.  \n\u00a2 Grouped under Class II in the List of Records.  \n@ Tbid., Class III.",

This group consists of the \u201ccourt booke\u201d of the council of the colony during the last year of the authority of the company, covering about 65 pages; 54 commissions, orders, proclamations, and warrants to subordinates in the colony issued by the governor and council in Virginia, and 35 petitions to the same body from the members of the colony. The publications of the company for this final period of its existence number 3 large broadsides, 11 declarations containing 168 printed pages, and 4 sermons and treatises made up of 150 pages. The supplementary official material found in the correspondence between individuals of the company and of the colony or between members of the company in England, in addition to the records of the private companies within the larger body, includes many documents and memoranda. Sixty-six of these are preserved in the Manchester papers, while 78 are from the Ferrar papers, which are now first made known and published. The unofficial material, consisting of records of other companies, of towns, and of correspondence touching on the affairs of the company or colony, numbers about 40 documents. The relative value of the various classes of the records for this period has been altered by the preservation of the court book which has made the other material supplementary, or even subsidiary, with the exception of the correspondence; for in it is either recorded or summarized the information which the company had received from all other sources, or which it imparted to individuals or to the public by other means. But the fact that the other records are supplementary does not decrease their value, for they often furnish the data which are the basis of the acts and conclusions of the company, while some of them also reveal the legal or political processes of the company, of the colony, of the courts, or of the sovereign authority, and others are of great value in the light which they throw on the dissenting party within the company. The subject-matter of the court book, as well as the character and contents of the various documents, proves the changed condition which the increase of business had brought about, since a large proportion of the records deal with the founding and conducting of private enterprises, and many of them are really documents of a private nature. It is apparent that the company still looked upon the colony as a source of income for the investors, but that the ulterior object. \n\n@Grouped under Class IV in the List of Records.

    "52": "442 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY to acquainte them with some alterations he had made therein, differing from the former Patents, especially in two points, namely in the head, and in the body thereof. First in the head, That whereas in the former Patents their chiefe officers were called by the name of Treasuror, he had in this given him a more eminent title, by styling him their Governor; because the name Treasuror seemed to imply an inferior officer and one that was to be an Accountant. And because the Northerne Colony Adventurers had to their Territories given the name of New-England, he thought fit that theirs did still retaine the old name of Virginia; for by this meanes all Virginia should be theirs. For the body of this Patent, as namely in their new Incorporation, he said, he had likewise differed from the former in two points: first in the material part thereof, by abridging the same, and restraining it only to such Adventurers and Planters as have at least one share of Land of 100 acres in Virginia. In the formal part thereof, as well to avoid the infinity of names by reason of the multitude of Adventurers (increasing still more and more), as for that many were already named in a former Patent, he therefore thought good in this to name only the Lords of the higher house of Parliament, and add thereunto these words comprehending in effect all the rest: viz: together with all other [188] Adventurers and Planters in Virginia. Some other necessary alterations and additions, he said he had made in some other part of the said Patent, which in the reading he would notify unto them, desiring their attention to the reading thereof, and to give their best advice about the same. \u2014 Before the Patent was read through, because the Afternoone was far spent, it was upon a motion agreed and ordered that the Court should continue till all businesses were ended. A motion of some sort was also moved by some of the Somers Islands company that the Court would please to think of some Course that might be forthwith taken signifying the great hinderance and losse that both the late Proclamations and Plantations had sustained by the late Proclamation and Grant of the sole importation of Tobacco to certaine Patentees: As likewise under",

The Patent being read and put to the question to know whether they would have it so to passe or desired any thing to be added thereunto, it was generally well approved of, and thought to be drawne fully and exactly, for which the Company gave vnto Sir Edwyn Sandys many deserved thankes for his great paines taken therein.

And forasmuch as Captain William Newce hath been specially recommended unto this Company by divers honourable persons of this kingdom for his fidelity, judgement, and sufficiency to undertake and perform the said office and service of Marshall, as having ever been exercised in military affaires and Armes: And for the said place of Treasurer because Mr. Sandys was in like manner proposed, whom all men conceived to be every way sufficient to take that charge upon him: It was thought fit and ordered that the generall Committees, assisted with some of the Counsell, should meet together and advise as well for settling of the said offices and places and for accommodating them with fitting allowances and people.

Sir Iohn Dauers delivered (and referred it to the Consideration of the Court) a motion that fell out to be made after the treaty of the Committees concerning the former officers was concluded: which was that in regard of the usual constitution of men and lands to belong to every chief officer's place, and some reason & experience had found that the officers Tenant were chiefly regarded and the general Companies Tenant the more neglected: it therefore might be fitting to cast and allot all the Governours and other officers Tenant into the number of the publique and out of [205] the whole profit belonging to the Company, and the said Governour and other officers should have their proportionable to the number of Tenants appointed unto them. By which means there would be a more general care for the advancing publique affaires and profit of the general Company since all the officers interest and Commodity was therein employed; which motion being conceived an Innovation and to overthrow things already established was (as the case now stood) thought more likely to introduce a conceit in the people of inconstancy of their government; and consequently a discontent than such a due reformation as might be hoped. Nevertheless it was worthy consideration whether the Treasurers place and other hereafter to be established might not very fittingly be referred to receive their proportionable maintenance from the profits of the publique Tenants since it was very probable that these officers so to be maintained would employ their own care, and likewise by their diligent watchfulness induce the former established officers, to bestow their pains more fully and diligently for the raising of the Companies profit and not so much to intend their own particulars: which motion was thought fit to be considered of hereafter.",

Mr. Waterhouse commended by Sir John Dauers. \n\nSt. Edwyn Sandys signified that my Lord of Southampton desired this Court to excuse him for his absence at this time being withheld upon extraordinary occasion: and though long absent yet his Lordship had been exceeding carefull of their buisines: for no longer agoe than Saturday last he signified that some of the Counsell having met at his Lordship's house, had conference for many howers together, about weighty buissinesses concerning Virginia: where they first took into their consideration the establishing of the Counsell of State there as likewise concerning the Governor and Secretary: whose Commissions continuing but for three yeares in certaine, did both expire in November next. In supply of the first they have already made choice of a worthy gentleman to be their Governor: namely Sir Francis Wyat who was shortly to set out to Virginia and to take his place at the expiration of Sir George Yeardley's Commission and not before: It was also well knowne unto them the choice that had been made of two new officers namely of Mr. George Sandys to be Treasurer of Virginia: and Sir William Newce to be their Marshall. But touching the Secretary of State there that now is namely (Mr. Porey) it remained to know their Pleasure whether they would continue him still in his said office or make a Change. Whereupon it was signified that for so much as Mr. Porey had not carried himself well in the said place to the contentment of the Company it was conceived to be the generall purpose of the Court to change him for a better so neere as they could and therefore desired some other might be nominated unto them. \n\nWhereupon Mr. Deputy gave notice of four worthy gentlemen that had been recommended unto him for that place all of them well bred sufficiently well qualified so as the meanest seemed much worthy of a better place not in respect of the quality thereof but in respect of the entertainment belonging thereunto so as it was his grief they had not places for them all but must be enforced to dismiss three of them. The names of the said gentlemen were these Mr. Paramore, Mr. Davison, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Waterhouse who hath been recommended by Sir John Dauers for three things especially. \n\n[228] At this point in the manuscript the handwriting returns to that of Nicholas Ferrar\u2019s assistant, referred to on page 270 as Thomas Collett.

[229] Sir Edwin Sandys declared further that they had taken into consideration matter of future support of the Plantation to supplie if they could now other helps do fail out of that contribution which is presumed will be given by each Citie, Towne, and Burrough towards the sending of their poore with whom they are pressed into Virginia, which justification offer being made vnto the lower house of Parliament vpon an occasion of the like complaint of the poore which are burdensome to many parishes, it was accepted of that house with a verie great and gratefull applause; It was therefore thought fit that some choyce bill should be drawn.",

The long teyning of many high price of Tobacco is the cheifest cause of Commodities neglected. Other men might be appointed to drawe a bill to that purpose against the next Parliament that the poore may hereafter be sent to Virginia at the charge of the parish where they live, which he wished the Company to consider of against the next Court. M' Casewell likewise moved that some course might be thought on to stir up the Companies here in London that had adventured money towards the Plantation in Virginia to do the like there by building of some Towne as they had already done in Ireland to their good profit, which motion was well approved of and thought fit to be prosecuted to effect. Touching Tobacco, which hath been always so generally affected by the Planters in Virginia, Sr. Edwin Sandys signified how extremely displeasing it was to the King and scandalous unto the Plantation and unto the whole Company, that notwithstanding it hath been prosecuted these many years by many wise and worthy persons and wasted in that time a Masse of money, yet it hath not produced any other effect, then that smokie weed of Tobacco; and therefore the Counsell, as heretofore it may appear by all their former instructions and letters, so now again had taken it into their consideration how they might restraine the generall planting thereof or at least bring it downe to a far lesse proportion and quantitie than now is made. He further declared that the cheifest cause that all other Commodities were neglected was found to be the long maintaining of the high price of Tobacco at 3s the pound, which had already destroyed a Magazine of at least 1000s charge unto certaine Adventurers for Apparell and other necessarie provisions whereof the Colony stood in need; which they repaid again in nothing but Tobacco, forcing it at that price upon the Cape Marchant, whereof a good part of it was scarce sold for 3s per pound; and now again they have repaid the whole Company in the like manner at the same price for all the charge they have been at for sending them Apprentices, Servants, and wives, which cost the Company here near 2000s. The action of the Privy Council for suppressing the importation of tobacco is cited in List of Records, No. 263, page 149, ante.",

Touching this point it was conceived no true estimate could be made till the number of the families were knowne and rectified; But for the price of Tobacco at 3d. per pound it was thought fit to be valued according to the goodnes thereof and at no certaine price. It was further signified that as it hath been the use and practise of forraigne kings and Monarchs (to their great glory and renowne) at certaine times to send some speciall worthy persons whom they call their Sendicks to visite all their Dominions and remoter Countries, and by vertue of their prerogative and power to examine with a curious eye the actions and carriage of all the principall Officers and Governors, to the end that those that had deserved well might be rewarded with honour, and others punished according to their Demerites; The like course have been thought fit by the Counsell here to be taken with the Officers in Virginia, and that a choyse Committee of men of worth and integritie might be authorised to examine and enquire into the actions and doings of former Officers, and thereof to return a good Account unto the Company here that they may proceed further therein according to the rules of Justice and equitie. Sir Edwin Sandys acquainted the Company with an exquisite discourse that a gentleman had made (though not perfected) for the advancement of the Plantation who desired his name might not be made knowne; which discourse he had divided into those five heads. The first was most necessarie, which was matter of food and sustenance for the Colony, whereof he had discovered the defects and proposed the way how it might be supplied. The Second was matter of health for preserving of which he had given excellent directions, observing the want thereof not to be through the ill condition of the Climate so much as through the disordered doings of the people and their misgovernment.",

The fourth was that whereon all mens eyes were fixed, namely Wealth, shewing how the Planter may whon and much gaine to himselfe set up a abundance of good and Staple Commodities whereof the Climate is knowne as capable as any in the world. The fifth and last head treated of Religion, civilitie of life, and how to keepe the people in amity and good agreement amongst themselves. The Court hereupon made a generall request that the gentleman might please to proceed to the perfecting of the said worthy worke and that a Committee might be appointed at the next Court to peruse it and so recommend it to the care of the Governor to make a beginning in that course that is like to conduce so mainly to the advancement of the Plantation. The Duty returned. The Deputy signified that whereas the Duty was now returned from Virginia and attended in the Downes for her direction whether to goe, ordering to send the Counsell and Committees having met about it have given order to Mr. Arthur Swaine to send her to Flushing and had also agreed with Mr. Arthur Swayne, a Marchant of London, commended for his fidelitie & sufficiency to be their factor there for putting off their Tobacco to their most profit, allowing him 2 in the C for his paynes, which he was contented with, and to this end gave him a Commission under the Companies Seale & certaine Instructions which the Counsell thought necessary for his direction in the business whereof he doubted not but that they should have a good Account of his doings.

He likewise signified that he had received intelligence of a Ship lately arrived in Ireland that came from Virginia, but what Ship it should be he knew not but hoped it was the Tryall which was yet behinde.

Master Deputy signified that it was thought fit a Pinace should be provided to be ready against September next for carrying the Silkworme seed for which my Lord had writ into Italy, France, and Spayne, which is promised to be here by that time. He further signified that my Lady Dale, late the wife of Sir Thomas Dale deceased, that worthy Knight and great advancer of the Virginia Action, desired a Patent for a particular Plantation which was granted and that direction should be given to the Governor to allot the place according to her Ladyship's request if it be not already planted. The like Patent with like direction to the Governor was ordered to be made ready for Sir Dudley Diggs and his Associates.

The Court thought fit that my Lord of Canterbury be moved to solicit these Bishops that are in arrear vpon Account by his graces Letter for paying in their Collections. It was likewise moved that the knights and gentlemen as also the Merchants and Citizens might be called vpon for payment of their moneys due by subscriptions which was referred to this next Quarter Court to be considered of.

The Court agreed that direction should be given to the Governor to that effect. Mr. Webb moved that some course might be taken that the two Indian Maids might be disposed of to free the Company of the weekly charge that now they are at for the keeping of them. Whereupon some having moved that they might be sent to the Summer Islands at the charge of this Company, it was thought fit rather to refer it to the next Court to determine thereof.

They will take it as a most singular favour that they may enjoy their former liberty for bringing their Commodities into England and transporting them elsewhere; But to be bound to bring in all their Commodities and to pay Custome here for all (howsoever markett rule abroad) in that they humble desire to be pardoned and most earnestly beseech your Lordships that they may not be compelled for these subsequent reasons and divers other weighty considerations. \n\n1. It is liberty and freedome that his Majesty's Subjects throughout his Dominions do generally practise and enjoy to be free to carry their Commodities to the best Market. \n\n2.

The same Company have granted divers Sub patents with the same privileges as they themselves enjoy whereby some of the Pattentees have been induced to go in person being men of noble and worthy families to expend great sums of money in the Plantation and some other their whole estates and it is not in the Companies power now to revoke or restrain them without a general disheartening of all present and future Adventurers. \n\n4. Many Commodities do now begin and are like to arise in Virginia that will not be vendible in England as namely Fish, Caviarie, Pipestaves, quantities of Sassafras, and Sarsaparilla and the meaner sort of Tobacco, which in other forraigne parts will yield something but being brought hither will not yield nor discharge the Custome. \n\n5. They do not conceive that they have power to dispose of the goods of Private Planters in Virginia who are free and have merited by their long and hard service all manner of freedome and encouragement. \n\n6.

Mr. Deputy acquainted the Court that one Mr. Copeland, a Minister lately returned from the East Indies, out of an earnest desire to give some furtherance vnto the Plantation in Virginia, had been pleased as well by his owne good example as by persuasion to stir up many that came with him in the Ship called the Royall James to contribute towards some good worke to be begun in Virginia: insomuch that he had procured already a matter of some 70 pounds to be employed that way and had also writ from Cape Bona Speranza to divers factors in the East Indies to move them to some charitable contribution thereunto, so as he hoped they should see very shortly his letters would produce some good effect amongst them, especially if he might understand in what manner they intended to employ the same. It was therefore ordered that a Committee should be appointed to treat with Mr. Copeland about it, and for so much as he had so well deserved of the Company by his extraordinary care and pains in this business it was thought fit and ordered that he should be admitted a free Brother of this Company and at the next Quarter Court it should be moved that some proportion of Land might be bestowed upon him in gratification of his worthy endeavours to advance this intended worke, and further it was thought fit also to add him.

The Committee nominated were these, viz. Sr. Dudly Diggs. Sr. Edwin Sandys. Sr. Io: Dauers. [290]",

It being formerly referred to a select Committee, vizt. Sr. Edwin Sandys, Mr. Wrote, Sr. Io: Dauers, Mr. Cranmer, Mr. Deputy Farrar, Mr. Berblocke, Mr. Io: Smith, Mr. Secre. Davison, Mr. Gibbs. They are now againe entreated to take some paines in drawing up of the said Publication, that such as haue been Adventurers may be stirred up to plant their land, which will be to the great advancement of the generall Plantation as well as their owne private benefit. Mr. Deputy signified that the Auditors according to the order of the Quarter Court in June last had made a true and perfect Account of all such somes of money as haue been received by the benefit of the Running Lotteries, and had also in the said Accounts declared the uses whereupon the said moneys haue been expended from time to time for the advancement of the Plantation, which Accounts they had according to the direction of the said Court presented in all humble Duty and thankfulness unto his Majesty. The whole great Some of which Accounts amounted to about 29000 pounds as may appeare, though it was by divers reported to haue been a far greater Some. He further signified that Mr. Barbour having had his Accounts particularly examined by the Auditors touching his receipt by the said Lotteries, who audited the same the last Terme and allowed thereof for which he was then to haue had his Quietus est, Mr. Deputy therefore moved that he might now have it at this Quarter Court, but Mr. Barbour rather desired that his Quietus est might be respited till the next.",

Whereas the Company had formerly contracted with Captaine Norton for setting up of a glasse furnace in Virginia to make glasse and beads (as by the particulars of the said Contract more at large may appeare) It was now declared that for so much as the Charge of furnishing out the said Capt Norton (when it came to be particularly examined) did far exceed that proportion which he had before proposed to the Company insomuch as the Common Stock being altogether exhausted was no way able to performe the same, so that this great work whereof the Company had conceived so good a hope was like to have fallen to nothing for want of sufficient meanes [291] to goe forward with it; for which cause the Company having given it over it pleased certain private Adventurers to uphold the same and thereupon entertained the bargaine made with Capt. Norton and the Italians upon like conditions as the Company had done, and yet being unwilling to exclude the Company from a business so much concerning them they did agree they should joyne with them in a fourth part of the Charge and so partake a fourth of the benefit that should any ways accrue thereby. In consideration whereof as also for their better encouragement the said Adventurers moved that the Company would please to bestow amongst them all the lands that should be due for transportation of people sent thither to be employed upon the said work, which motion the Court conceived to be very reasonable and fit to be granted in respect of the great charge they have and must still be at in prosecution thereof; being therefore put to the question the Court confirmed the same unto them. Mr. Deputy signified that whereas it pleased the Company to rest the exhibiting of his Accounts till this Quarter Court in respect that moneys were not then ready to discharge those debts which he and some others stood engaged for for many kinds of provisions taken up for the use and service of the Company yet having now satisfied a",
    "171": "558 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY good part of the said Debte (so as there remayned onely but 100\" for the Companie to paye) he thought good to present his Account as it was though not fully perused that they might be acquainted with the State thereof and so leaue it to their pleasure for the auditing of it, but the Court conceived it more convenient to respite the same till the next Quarter Court, hoping by that time sufficient meanes would come in to the full finishing of his Account. Concerning Sr. Edwin Sandys Account Mr. Deputy signified that he would ere long be here himselfe to present the same vnto them, when he doubted not but he would giue the Companie good satisfaction. \n\nThe Committee appointed by the former Court having taken into consideration what proportion of allowance they conceived to be necessarie for the present support and maintenance of a Vice admiral in Virginia, whereof they conceived there was a verie great necessity and that the want of such an Officer hath been no small losse and preinduce vnto the Companies Ships and provisions and other publique service, have thought fit in respect of the quality of the place to state the same with 300 acres of land and the number of 12 Tenants to be placed thereupon for the planting and cultivating thereof, which allowances were thought verie reasonable and thereupon being put to the question were ratified and confirmed. \n\nAnd for so much as Mr. Io: Pountis was especially recommended for the said place of Vice admiral in respect of his sufficiency and continuall regard of the publique good and of the Companies directions (in consideration whereof he was by a former Court chosen to execute the said place by Commission provisionally for one yeare until it might be further confirmed vnto him by order of a Quarter Court) It is therefore now agreed and ordered that the said Io: Pountis shall continue in the place of Vice admiral for three yeares beginning from the date of these presentes. \n\nWhereas there was a contribution of 70\" freely given by certaine gentlemen and Mariners of the East India Company that came home in the Royall Tames which they desired might be employed towards the",

They also signified further that an unknown person out of a zealous affection to advance so pious a work had given 30 pounds more, both which sums were now brought into the Court and laid upon the Table. It was also further declared in the report of the said Committee being entered at large in the Court held the last of October that they thought fit for the maintenance of the said Schoolemaster and his Usher to be placed in the said Schoole to allow no lesse than 1000 acres of land and five persons beside an Overseer of them which they thought fit should be forthwith sent upon this former charge (in condition of Apprentices) to manure and cultivate the said lands, with allowance of land and Servants being intended for this as a Collegiate Schoole, the Court conceived to be very reasonable and thereupon being put to the question were accordingly confirmed. \n\nForasmuch as it was also informed that Mr. Copland was a good means by his own example to move the aforesaid Companie to give that contribution of 70 pounds being Preacher in the said Ship and had further also writ to divers Factories in the East Indies to stir them up to the like charitable contribution towards this pious work: It was therefore thought fit and ordered that the said Mr. Copland by way of gratification should have 3 shares old Adventure bestowed upon him as a free gift and should also be admitted a free Brother of the Company. It was likewise moved that the Companie would please to admit Mr. Balmeford into their Society in respect he had deserved so well by his often attendance at Court and readiness to do the Companie service, for which cause the Court hath made him free and do intreat his accustomed pains and attendance in the service of the Companie. \n\n16455\u2014vol 1\u201406\u2014\u201436",

Whereas Captaine Martin preferred a petition to the Preparative Court complaining of divers grievances which he desired the Company to take into their considerations, an offer was made unto him that if he would surrender his old Patent which had been so often questioned and complained of both by the Company here and by the Governor and Counsell of State in Virginia in respect of the unlawful privileges therein; directly contradicting the standing orders of the Company which required all Patents to be made alike with equal favour (excepting the difference of Rent) unto all, he should then not only have a new Patent in as large and ample manner as any other whatsoever but should also have what further favour and assistance for redress of his said grievances, as the Company in equity could afford him, notwithstanding...",

Martin refused to deliver up his said Patent, saying that he would petition to the Quarter Court touching the premisses, and stand to the censure and judgement thereof. Whereupon the matter being now againe propounded and a Coppie of his Patent openly read, many just exceptions were taken thereat in respect it contained greater immunities than the Company may or can grant by the King\u2019s Letters Patente, insomuch as the Court thought fit for their better information to refer it to a select Committee to be reviewed; and thereupon did nominate Mr. Herbert, Mr. Iermyn, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Wrote, Mr. Earle, Mr. Nicholas Farrar, Mr. Gibbs, authorising them or any fower of them to meet about the same at Mr. Farrars house when Mr. Deputy shall appoint, and to call Capt.

Which Patents were of two sorts: the one of such as were Adventurers by moneys paid into the Treasury, for which they had allowed 100 acres of land for every single share of Twelve pounds Ten shillings; the other being for Planters only, who had allowed fifty acres for every person transported to Virginia.

The Third Roll was for sending of Maids to Virginia to be made Wives, which the Planters there did very much desire; by the want of whom have sprung the greatest hinderances of the increase of the Plantation, in that most of them esteeming Virginia not as a place of Habitation but only of a short sojourning, have applied themselves and their labours wholly to the raising of present profit and utterly neglected not only staple Commodities but even the very necessities of man's life; in regard whereof and to prevent so great an inconvenience hereafter, whereby the Planters' minds may be the faster tied to Virginia by the bonds of Wives and Children, care hath been taken to provide them young, handsome, and honestly educated maids, whereof 60 are already sent to Virginia, being such as were specially recommended unto the Company for their good bringing up by their parents or friends of good worth: These maids are to be disposed in marriage to the most honest and industrious Planters who are to defray and satisfie to the Adventurers the charges of their passages and provisions at such rate as they and the Adventurers' Agents there shall agree; and in case any of them fail through mortality, it is ordered that a proportionable addition shall be made upon the rest.

Captaine Leeke presenting a Letter to this Court from the right Honourable the Lord Chamberlen directed vnto the Counsell and Company of Virginia; being opened and read, it appeared that his Lordship moved for two things in the behalfe of Capt.

Which place Capt. Leeke himselfe also said that he affected onely for the honors sake without desiring to put the Company to any Penny charge for the same; whereupon the Court being willing to satisfie his Lordship so far as conveniently they might in respect of his Lordship's good affection vnto the Plantation and Honourable endeavour to aduance the same, hath therefore made choice of a select Committee to take it into their consideration, viz.

Again, to begin with building of a free school for them in Virginia, he doubted (considering that none of the buildings there intended had as yet prospered) by reason that as yet through their doting so much upon Tobacco, no such workmen could be had but at intolerable rate; it might rather tend to the exhausting of this sacred Treasure in some small fabric than to accomplish such a foundation, as might satisfy men's expectations; whereupon he wished again some meeting between the Gentlemen or his friends and Southampton Society, that all things being debated at full and judiciously weighed, some constant course might be resolved on and pursued for the proceeding in and perfecting of this most pious work, for which he prayed the blessing of God to be upon the Author thereof; and all the Company said Amen.\n\nIn the midst of this narration, a stranger stepped in presenting 4 books fairly bound sent from a person refusing to be named, who had bestowed them upon the College in Virginia, being from the same man that gave heretofore four other great books.

    "252": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 had become the development of the resources of Virginia instead of the production of wealth through mines and the opening of new trade routes. As a result of this change in commercial object had come the need of larger, more numerous, and more scattered settlements in the colony, and of greater co-operation on the part of the settlers, although it may well be claimed that the latter necessity had been urged upon the leaders by the mismanagement of Captain Argall during the three years previous to the change in administration. In order to increase the number of planters, concessions of privilege had been made to private parties or groups as early as 1618, since such investments were doubtless easier to secure when the adventure was under the immediate control of the undertaker. Similarly, for the purpose of stimulating capital and gaining the co-operation of the planters, the division of land, promised in 1609, was proclaimed in 1616. Free tenancy was now guaranteed to all individuals, even to indented servants, at the expiration of seven years. The organization of joint stock companies for the management of trade, which supplanted the magazine, was a movement toward private enterprise. Hence it is that these subjects, together with those which concern the importation and sale of tobacco, occupy the greater part of the court book, and must have consumed most of the attention of the corporation. The burden of discussion in the courts concerned the best means of marketing the products, whereas in the earlier decade it must have related to the increase of capital. The records of the colony were no longer simple reports to the company and instructions from the proprietor, but assumed the character of political documents, since liberty of land and trade, and the creation of numerous plantations and scattered settlements resulted in the growth of \u201cpolitical conditions and forces side by side with the commercial and economic.\u201d The minutes of the colonial legislative assembly, the records of the colonial court, the petitions to the governor and council, and the commissions and orders granted by that body are all distinctively new features in the records. Here is evidence of the creation of the colony, with its body of free citizens, out of the plantation, with its body of half-servile laborers.\n\nTHE JEFFERSON LIBRARY IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS The records of the company under the administration of Sir Edwin Sandys and the Earl of Southampton, or the copies of them so far as extant, are to-day scattered among many public and private collections both in England and in America. The Library of Congress at Washington possesses by far the largest and most important collection in this country. It contains the contemporary certified copy of the court book from 1619 to 1624, as well as a mass of original correspondence, or contemporary copies of the same, between the company and the council in Virginia.",
    "253": "42 INTRODUCTION  \nIt also includes many original records of the colony, many eighteenth century transcripts of the original commissions, patents, and other records, and many recent transcripts and photographs of documents in the collections of England. The eighteenth century transcripts and the original documents and contemporary copies came to the Library of Congress from Thomas Jefferson\u2019s collection in two different groups: the first in 1815, when his library, purchased \u2018in a lump as it stood on the catalogue,\u201d was secured by Congress for the sum of $23,950; the second was secured when the books of Mr. Jefferson were sold at auction subsequent to his death in 1826. The catalogue of the auction sale classified those acquired by the Library of Congress at the latter date under two numbers as follows:  \n\u2018*No. 121. Records of the Virginia Company, 2 vols., fol. MS. (the authentic copy mentioned in Stith\u2019s History).  \n**No. 122. Old Records of Virginia, 4 vols. fol. MS. viz:  \n\u2018*A.

Transactions of the council from Dec. 9, 1698, to May 20, 1700.\u201d  \nThe volumes of Jefferson manuscripts relating to the company, which became the property of the Government in 1815, were as follows:  \n(1) First laws made by the Assembly in Va. anno 1623 (Used by Hening.)  \n(2) Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634.

    "254": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624  \n(4) Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683. Instructions, Commissions, letters of Advice and admonitions, and Public Speeches, Proclamations, &c. Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assembly. The entire set in the first group, acquired in 1829, is composed either of original documents or of contemporary transcripts, while the second paper of the second group belongs to the same period. The Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683, are a seventeenth century transcript. The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R. Hickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification of these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the company, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as the [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion, arising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of Virginia, William Stith and John D. Burk, and by the editor of many of the documents in 1809, William Hening. The following statements with regard to the first group made by Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1825, will serve as a basis for the attempt to ascertain the history and authenticity of those manuscripts:  \n\u2018The only manuscripts I now possess relating to the antiquities of our country are some folio volumes: Two of these are the proceedings of the Virginia company in England; the remaining four are of the Records of the Council of Virginia, from 1622 to 1700. The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to Stith's History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company, copied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of Southampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor Byrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These volumes happened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland, whose library I purchased, and with this they were sent to me. I gave notice of it to Mr. Zane, but he never reclaimed them.  \n\u2018The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the council. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin the History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from the council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he had made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably unobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his executor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes were sent to me as a part of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being handled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily opened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years.\u2019  \nFrom the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825.  \nCol. R. Bland died October 26, 1776.",
    "255": "44 INTRODUCTION  \nCONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK  \nThe two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the \u201cproceedings of the Virginia Company in England\u201d are the contemporary copies of the court book which were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the estate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or later. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have been when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he made a visit to England, that he made the purchase. That the books remained in the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by the fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the third William Byrd, who died in 1777; but these two volumes were not in the library of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac Zane. Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may be accepted; but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when he states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been returned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that Colonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contemporary copies of the court book in his History of Virginia is apparent from his description of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated to him by the \u201clate worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq.\u201d  \n\nMANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III  \nThe other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from Mr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue, belong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr. Jefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of the Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to Mr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of Virginia, he describes in a similar way.  \n\n@ William Byrd died December 4, 1704. See Byrd, History of the Dividing Line.  \nb \u201cCatalogue of the Books in the Library at Westover belonging to William Byrd, Esqr.,\u201d p. 437, in The Writings of Colonel William Byrd, edited by J. S. Bassett.  \nc For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion, pp. 78-84, post.  \n@ It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been acquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton Randolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by Justin Winsor. See Narrative and Critical History of the United States, III, 158.  \ne Hening, Statutes at Large, I, p. viii.",
    "256": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1634\n\nThat these are the papers discussed by Stith is proved by comparing them with the Hickman (Bland) transcripts. In his preface, Stith confirms the description by Mr. Jefferson, but he apparently destroys the latter's theory that the papers had been in the possession of Peyton Randolph since the death of Sir John Randolph in 1736. Mr. Stith wrote his preface in 1746, and suggests that they were at that time in the possession of the House of Burgesses, although he does not make a positive statement to that effect. His assertions are worth recording, since they carry the history of the volumes back thirty years and also throw light on the Hickman transcripts. \n\n\u201cIt must chiefly depend upon such of our Records, as are still extant. Many of them doubtless perished in the State-house at James-Town, and by other Accidents: and those, which have survived the Flames and Injuries of Time, have been so carelessly kept, are so broken, interrupted, and deficient, have been so mangled by Moths and Worms, and lie in such a confused and jumbled State (at least the most ancient of them) being huddled together in single Leaves and Sheets in Books out of the Binding, that I foresee, it will cost me infinite Pains and Labour, to reduce and digest them in any tolerable Order, so as to form from them a just and connected Narration. And some of them have been lost, even since Mr. Hickman was Clerk of the Secretary\u2019s Office. For I cannot find, among the Papers in our Offices, some old Rolls, to which he refers. I have therefore been obliged, in a few Points, to depend upon the Fidelity of that Gentleman\u2019s Extracts out of our oldest Records, made for the Use of Sir John Randolph. But these things were so far from discouraging and rebuffing me, that they were rather an additional Spur to my Industry. For I thought it highly necessary, before they were entirely lost and destroyed, to apply them to their proper Use, the forming a good History. But as the House of Burgesses in a late Session, upon my shewing their moldering and dangerous State to some of the Members, have justly taken them into their Consideration, and have ordered them to be reviewed and fairly transcribed, I doubt not, by their Assistance, and with the Help of the late Sir John Randolph\u2019s Papers, and such others, as are in the Hands of private Gentlemen in the Country, and will undoubtedly be readily communicated to further so noble and so useful a Design, to be able to collect and compose a tolerably regular and complete History of our Country.\u201d \n\nHence, we are again left in a quandary. The papers may have come into Peyton Randolph\u2019s possession through the arrangement made by the burgesses for their transcription; but no transcript made directly from the documents as late as 1745 is known to us. Whether they were borrowed from the province by Mr. Stith or by Peyton Randolph, his brother-in-law, or by some other historian or antiquarian is not yet proved; and our only evidence that Jefferson secured them from Peyton Randolph\u2019s executor is his statement made twenty years after the date of the purchase. \n\n\u201cStith, History of Virginia, preface, p. viii.\u201d",
    "257": "46 INTRODUCTION  \nThe papers, after almost a century in the Capitol, were in a still more deplorable condition in 1901 than that described by Mr. Stith, but the loose pages have now been carefully and skillfully repaired. The order of contents of the volumes (while not chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the direction of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by the early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts are original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them, by the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of the period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province House was burned in Bacon\u2019s rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch in 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter half of the eighteenth century.  \nThe volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled \u201cLetters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625,\u201d is evidently the one referred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as \u201cthe other side of No. A 42.\u201d This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, called by Hening the \u2018Bland copy.\u201d In pages 1 to 14 of this volume are eighteen letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while pages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. The first group are holographs, but of a secretary or clerk not yet identified. The second are doubtless in the autograph of Edward Sharpless. Both are contemporary copies of the originals. The documents classed in the Jefferson catalogue as 122 (42) form the balance of this volume and also probably include the journal of the council and assembly, 1626-1634. The latter was evidently used by Hening in compiling his statutes.  \nPresuming that this fragile document, which is the only one concerning the company and the colony while controlled by the company, formed one volume, its contents was as follows:  \nNo. A 42:  \n1. (a) Miscellaneous letters from the Privy Council to the governor and council in Virginia in 1623, pp. 1-3.

He remained as acting secretary until his trial on May 20, 1624, for giving copies of the acts of the assembly to the commissioners of the King; John Sotherne then took up his duties.  \nSee Plates, post, Vol. II for illustrations of these holographs, and for evidence as to the autographs.",

The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above.

Claybourne or Claiborne. / Joseph [Jokeg] / Tho Farloue & / Upton gent / Thos. Ba[u]rbag[e] / Clef Con\u00e9.\u201d This may belong to the records of the period after May 14, 1626, when William Claybourne was appointed secretary of the colony by Charles I, or it may have been placed in an earlier volume, or it may indicate that a part at least of the earlier volume was transcribed under his direction. Section B (9) of No. 122 in the Jefferson catalogue, cited as orders from February, 1622, to November, 1627, and including loose pages as late as 1634, is the only octavo manuscript of these records and has been saved from its almost useless condition by repair. That this is the original blotter of the court book of the governor and council in Virginia, containing the original record of suits tried before that body and of orders issued by it, is proved by the hasty and brief entries, giving the volume an entirely different character from those of the carefully elaborated transcripts of the clerks. The records of twenty-three courts held as here given and of the cases considered during the era of the authority of the company, consisting of about forty-five pages of manuscript, are noted in the list of the records of the company, but are not printed in this collection since they may be included more properly in a publication of the \u201cRecords of the Colony.\u201d  \nTHE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS RANDOLPH COPY  \nIt is now certain that at least two copies of the court book existed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, since the so-called John Randolph [of Roanoke] copy has recently come to light. It bears every evidence of being an eighteenth century transcript made from the contemporary copy now in the Library of Congress; the manuscript is of the century following that of the contemporary copy; the order, paragraphing, form of insertion of documents, and material is identical; but the omissions and errors arise from illegibility in the earlier manuscript. The other differences lie in occasional carelessness by the copyist and in the fact that the abbreviations are expanded and the spelling and the capitalization are modernized. The caption of the first volume of this eighteenth century copy is as follows: \u201cThe Ancient Records of this Colony under The Treasurer and Company.\u201d It opens with \u201cA Quarter Court held for Virginia at Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s house in @ The three volumes are in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, but they are so closely associated with the Library of Congress MSS. that they are discussed here rather than under the MSS. of Richmond.",

Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name \u201cCawson\u201d in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theodorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke.

Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D. C., as follows: \u201cA complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by himself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Virginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d* Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619-1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Hening as \u201cAncient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of  \n@See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson\u2019s father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond.  \nA letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Conway Robinson.  \n*For the extracts from the \u201cAncient Records,\u201d Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76-113 (collated readings given), 113-120, 145, 146, 209, 223.",

That the Randolph copy was not made from the original records is evidenced by the fact that the abstracts are identical with those of the Hickman or \u2018Bland\u2019 copy. That both Hening and Burk used the Randolph copies of the court book and also the third volume of that series is proved by their descriptions of the volumes, while the page references to \u2018Ancient Records\u2019 cited by Hening coincide in each case with these three volumes. Mr. Hening speaks of three large folio volumes not in the orthography of the age of the events, and compiled without much regard to method for the purpose of forming material for a history of Virginia, and states that the first two volumes are minutes of the proceedings of the London Company, and the third an epitome of the legislative and judicial acts of authorities in Virginia, so far as then extant, which were regularly transmitted to England. These, he continues, were used by John Burk, who got them from John Randolph, and also by Skelton Jones, 1809, to complete Burk\u2019s History of Virginia. Mr. Burk himself declares that there are two large volumes, instead of three, as stated by Hening, \u2018containing the minutes of the London Company together with the proceedings of the Virginia Councils and Assembly, with little interruption to the middle of the reign of George II.\u2019 \n\nJEFFERSON TRANSCRIPTS \n\nThe three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia Records which came from the Jefferson Library in 1815 are unique, containing copies of records since destroyed. Two of them are attested by R. Hickman, the deputy clerk of the general court in 1722, and the third is the only seventeenth century transcript in our possession. Unlike the Randolph copies, the two large volumes include copies of records since destroyed. Of this group the \u2018First laws made by the assembly in Va. Anno 1623\u2019 bears on the back of the last page the following indorsement in Mr. Jefferson's hand: \u2018This was found among the manuscript papers of Sr. John Randolph and by the Honorable Peyton Randolph, Esq. his son was given to Tho.

It must also be the subject of a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Hening, April 8, 1815, in which he states that the manuscript marked \u2018A\u2019 contains laws of 1623-24, thirty-five acts, which was given him by Peyton Randolph from the materials used by Sir John Randolph, and which Mr. Jefferson declares to @Hening, Statutes at Large, I, 76 n.

Burk some of the printed laws of Virginia in his possession, since they were unique and could not be replaced. The internal evidence points to the fact that Hening also used the other volumes of this set, a fact corroborated by the following statement of Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Mr. George Watterson, May 7, 1815: \u2018\u201cI gave to Mr. Milligan a note of those folio volumes of the Laws of Virginia belonging to the Library which being in known hands, will be recovered. One is a MS. volume from which a printed copy is now preparing for publication.\u201d Mr. Hening was doubtless using them in the preparation of his later volumes. Certain it is that these documents form the basis for a part of his first volume, in which he cites the Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634, as belonging to Thomas Jefferson, and as having been \u2018purchased by him with the library of Peyton Randolph, from his executors.\u201d The third, the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692, he states was bought by Mr. Jefferson \u2018from the executor of Richard Bland, dec\u2019d.\u201d The seventeenth century volume, entitled Instructions, Commissions, letters of Advice and admonitions and Publick Speeches, Proclamations, &c: Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assemblie, is a vellum-covered book, with an embossed figure on the back cover, and with the following: \u2018\u201cE/ 1621/ Publick, Letters / and Orders.\u201d On the outside of the front cover upside down is: \u2018\u201cE/ John Bland | Richard Bland | Alexander Morrison,\u201d while on the half that remains of the first fly leaf is the name \u2018\u201cNelson.\u201d On the fly leaf in the book in pencil is the statement: \u2018\u201cdate of MSS 1650-1695;\u201d and on the front cover similarly is: \u2018\u201c17th Century copie Bland.\u201d This presence of Richard Bland\u2019s name in the book shows that Mr. Jefferson secured it with the Bland Library. The writing of the volume is similar to the early seventeenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double /, and the formation of some of the letters. Evidently this is a collection of correspondence of the colony, transcribed from the court books and from the miscellaneous papers of the three volumes of the manuscript records of the company.

The documents in the folio volume are charters, instructions, commissions, letters from the Privy Council, and other documents emanating from the Crown, together with one or two from the company and from the council in Virginia. That this volume is the one used by Hening in his Statutes and referred to as the \u201cBland copy\u201d is indicated by the contents as well as by the fact that it includes the quarto volume. His reason for citing it as the \u201cBland copy\u201d can only be surmised, namely, that he had Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that it had been secured with the Bland library, an erroneous designation as is proved by Stith\u2019s statement in his preface, that R.

    "265": "54 INTRODUCTION  \nThe Library of Congress has recently acquired a large number of transcripts of those manuscripts now in the libraries of Great Britain pertaining to the Virginia Company or to the colony under the authority of the company. It thus possesses reproductions of all of the Virginia material in the British Museum, the Privy Council office, the Bodleian Library, and the Magdalene College Library, Cambridge. In the Public Record Office all docquet notices on Virginia, all records of suits in chancery and the admiralty pertaining to Virginia, and the quo warranto in the King\u2019s Bench, by which the company was dissolved, as well as the most important documents and correspondence, have been transcribed or photographed for the Library of Congress, but the correspondence of the planters, the less important correspondence of the company, and mere memoranda are yet to be transcribed. The latter material is fairly outlined in the Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574 to 1660, and in the Appendix of the eighth report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, or is printed elsewhere in full.  \nThe collection of publications by the company belonging to the Library of Congress is fairly good. It contains twelve of those which were issued before 1616, but of the later books it has only three. The Declaration of 1620, the Declaration by Waterhouse in 1622, and John Donne\u2019s Sermon of the same year, in addition to Smith\u2019s General History, are the only ones of the eighteen now extant which are in the Library.  \n\nDOCUMENTS IN RICHMOND  \nThe colonial records in Richmond, Virginia, relating to the period of the company are extremely few in number. Fortunately the original documents, which are in the Library of Congress, were borrowed or abstracted from the state house in time to save them from destruction during the Revolution or by fire in 1865. There are, however, two volumes of original records in the Virginia State land office containing grants of land in 1623 and 1624, which were evidently entered by William Claybourne, at that time surveyor for the colony. The history of contemporary documents before 1625, which are located in the district of the old settlement, may thus be briefly told.  \nThe valuable collections of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond embrace the John Randolph of Roanoke transcripts described above, while the State library has three sets of transcripts and one set of abstracts from the British Public Record Office. Of the latter the De Jarnette papers, 1606-1691, include only 4 All of these papers are included in the List of Records.  \nWilliam G.

In the Lenox branch of the New York Library is to be found a unique set of documents relating to the settlement of Berkeley Hundred in 1619, known as the Smyth of Nibley papers which \u201care from the collection of Virginia manuscripts originally brought together by John Smyth (or Smith) of Nibley, the historian of the Berkeleys, who was born in 1567 and died in 1641. The collection comprises over sixty papers, original and contemporary transcripts, relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and 1634. After passing into the hands of John Smyth the younger, and more recently into the Cholmondeley collection at Condover Hall, Shropshire, the manuscripts were offered for sale in January, 1888, by Mr. Bernard Quaritch, from whom they were lately bought and given to the New York Public Library by Mr. Alexander Maitland.\u201d* With the exception of the manuscripts in the Ferrar collection relating to Smythe\u2019s Hundred, these form the only extant records of the important movement for private plantations in Virginia under the r\u00e9gime of the company. Two other valuable documents are now in the possession of the Lenox Library, the holographic letter of John Pory, secretary of the colony, dated September 30, 1619, and Commissioner John Harvey\u2019s declaration of the State of Virginia in 1624.\n\nCOLLECTIONS OF AMERICANA\n\nThe manuscripts in the Library of Congress, the Smyth of Nibley papers in the New York Public Library, and the patent books in Virginia are the only original records of the company or of the colony previous to 1625 now in America. But there are two public collections of Americana which are extremely valuable for this period: The John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island, which contains only books on America published before the year 1800, and the New York Public Library.\n\n* Quoted from the New York Public Library Bulletin (1897), 1, 68, and (1899), III, 160. \n* List of Records, Nos. 133 and 640.",
    "267": "56 INTRODUCTION  \nIn the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the only documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a division of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by the Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an imperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary pamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has heretofore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch of supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of June 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John Brinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox Library. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled \"Virginia's God be Thanked,\" with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there are copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition to these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing \"The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\" and Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \"A valuation of the commodities growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\" are to be found in the Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox libraries. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by John Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Earl of Southampton, now to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries. The New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter Brown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains two unique publications of the company; the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620, which is the only copy known to the Editor. The other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of the declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King and of the council; Patrick Copland\u2019s \"Virginia\u2019s God be Thanked,\" and his Declaration how the monies were disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse\u2019s Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John Donne\u2019s Sermon, 1622. There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress. \"The Inconveniences\" was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in the Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London. A copy was in the Cholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May, 1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition that it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem valid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page in that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.",
    "268": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624  \nMay, 1887, describes such a broadside, which is known to have been purchased by Mr. Kalbfleisch. The second is A Note of the Shipping, etc., sent to Virginia in 1621. The Cholmondeley copy of this also was sold by Mr. Quaritch to Mr. Kalbfleisch. A third copy of the same is in the collection of printed broadsides of the Society of Antiquaries in London. The volumes of printed material relating to the Virginia Company, which are in the Harvard Library, have been mentioned above. Two private collections deserve mention for their comparatively large number of important publications of the company, the private collection in New York and that of Mr. Edward Ayer, in Chicago, Illinois. In addition to twenty other rare publications of the company, Mr. Ayer has a unique book entitled 'Greevoys Grones for the Poore,' 1621. It refers to the Virginia Company in its address only, and in the statement of the number of poor that had been sent to Virginia, but is of value for an understanding of that movement. The other private collection is of about the same size. It contains the duplicate of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox and the only known copy of a four-page tract entitled 'Declaration how the monies were disposed (being) collections for the Grammar Schooles,' by Patrick Copland. In the catalogue of Bernard Quaritch for May, 1887, the broadside of May 17, 1620, and the Note of the Shipping, 1621, are both noted as being unique since each contains the final clause: 'Who-soever transports himself or any other at his own charge unto Virginia, shall for each person so transported before mid-summer, 1625, have to him and his heirs forever 50 acres of land upon a first and 50 acres upon a second division.' A copy of the Note of the Shipping, 1621, in the Cholmondeley collection is similarly described in the fifth report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, page 341. The Quaritch copies were sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch, whose collection went to Mr. Lefferts, and finally through the dealers, Geo. H. Richmond or Dodd, Mead & Co., either to a private collection or to the Lenox Library. But the Lenox copies either do not correspond to these descriptions or were not purchased from Mr. Lefferts. The volumes of the Lefferts collection, which were not sold in America, were sent to Sotheby, England, but Mr. Eames of the New York Public Library states that no early Virginia material was allowed to return to England. The collection of Americana belonging to Mr. Ayer is open to the public through the Newberry Library. For the early Virginia material of the library see Index under 'Ayer, Edward.' This tract is described in the Appendix of the Fifth Report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, as follows: 'A Declaration how the monies, viz., 70\", 8s. 6d., were disposed, which was gathered (by Mr. Patrick Copland, preacher in the Royal James) at the Cape of Good Hope (toward the building of a free schoole in Virginia) of the gentlemen and mariners in the said ship; a list of whose names are under specified, &c. 4\u00b07 pp. Imprinted at London by F. K. 1622.'",
    "269": "58 INTRODUCTION\n\nTRANSCRIPTS IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\nOther attempts have been made to secure resources for research in America. Not only is there the aggregation of excerpts from the English documents in Richmond, as described above, and the acquisition of transcripts in the Library of Congress within recent years, but half a century ago a similar interest was displayed by collectors and historians in New York City, forming three collections which are to-day in the Lenox Library. William H. Aspinwall, a merchant, secured among other papers the Chalmers collection of letters and documents relating to Virginia from 1606 to 1775. They were in turn sold to Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, a lawyer and notable collector of New York City, from whom a part were purchased by the library, while others came to the Lenox with the Bancroft transcripts in 1898. Chalmers had been a clerk in the State paper office and seems to have taken these extracts, outlines, and sometimes full copies from the Plantation office papers, since he continually refers to them in his Politicall Annals. They are modernized transcripts, failing to follow the early orthography, abbreviations, and capitalization. The writing is cramped and often almost illegible, while the table of contents is incomplete and useless. They comprise (1) a series of brief outlines of Privy Council orders; (2) extracts from the Dudley-Carleton papers; (3) outlines of additional Council orders; (4) a calendar of certain of the colonial State papers; (5) outlines of council orders dealing with other trading companies. All of the original documents are at present in the Public Record Office and are noted in the Bibliographical List of Records following. The Bancroft papers relating to Virginia and the Simancas Archives are well bound, clear, and apparently careful, correct, and full copies of the documents included. The first two volumes of the Bancroft collection bearing on the Virginia Company are transcripts of many of the documents in the State paper office, probably made in 1852 by Noel Sainsbury, but the list is not complete. While the peculiar and characteristic signs of abbreviation are not followed, the orthography seems to be accurate throughout. Furthermore, the collection includes the document entire, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents is careful and correct. The \u201cSimancas Archives\u201d is a volume of transcripts of \u201cPapers in the Simancas Archives relating to the History of Virginia and other portions. \n\nSee a statement by Victor H.

    "270": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 of America between 1608 and 1624, made for Alexander Brown and many of them used by him in his book, The Genesis of the U. S. The only document relating to Virginia which is not reproduced in that collection is a repetition of the proclamation of the King of England concerning tobacco, bearing the date November 12, 1624. \n\nCOLLECTIONS IN ENGLAND \n\nFERRAR PAPERS \n\nThe most unique collection in England for the study of the Virginia Company is that in the possession of Magdalen College, Cambridge. As the property of Nicholas and John Ferrar, who were second only to Sir Edwin Sandys in their activity in the company, it would be invaluable; but its importance is further enhanced by the fact that it contains the correspondence and papers of Sir Edwin Sandys himself. These seventy-eight papers, which are either records of the company or vitally concern it, cover the period of the Sandys-Southampton influence from 1617 to the summer of 1623. They were the property of Dr. Peckard, master of Magdalen College in 1790, and were bequeathed to the college upon his death. It is probable that the greater part of the collection came from the Ferrar family through Dr. Peckard\u2019s wife, Martha Ferrar, the great grand-daughter of John Ferrar, since the Virginia papers form but one-third of the group. The remaining papers concern family affairs only, and date from 1601 to the middle of the eighteenth century. Some of them are doubtless those received from the Earl of Dorset by Dr. Peckard, when he was preparing his Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar. \n\nThe first knowledge of the Ferrar papers in later years was communicated to the Virginia Magazine of History by Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Little Gidding, Ealing, England. He sent a number of transcripts and photographs of letters to the magazine for publication, among which were some half dozen bearing on the affairs of the company, but the number which he was permitted to reproduce was limited by the college. While Mr. Ferrar was completing a history of the Ferrar family the entire collection was deposited at his home, and it was therefore in Ealing in the fall of 1903 that the Editor was first permitted by the authorities of the college to \u201csee and note the contents\u201d of the papers. Before the following summer Mr. Ferrar had died and the collection had been returned to Cambridge, where complete transcripts of all letters and photographs of all documents relating to the Virginia Company were made for the Library of Congress under the supervision of the Editor. \n\nIn this work Dr. Peckard states that the Earl of Dorset had had his library searched and had sent him a few loose papers belonging to the Virginia Company.",
    "271": "60 INTRODUCTION  \nThese papers are loose, many of them being much damaged, and it is apparent that they are a part of a larger collection which must have been neglected while in the possession of the family. There are some envelopes without letters, many rough memoranda by both Nicholas and John Ferrar, some account books, and some rough drafts of petitions to the House of Commons and of discussions on the silkworm. The autographs which they furnish of both Nicholas and John Ferrar have been of no little interest, as well as value, for the identification of other papers in the Public Record Office, and in the Library of Congress. Furthermore, the proof that Nicholas Ferrar himself supervised the transcript of the court book is thus gained. In this collection are twenty-three papers which are veritable records of the company. Two documents give our only knowledge of the financial affairs of Smythe\u2019s Hundred, slight indeed, but from them comes additional information concerning the system of organization of the societies for private adventure. Sundry other unique though scattered documents are among these papers, such as receipts for money expended, showing the method of business, reports of committees, and of proceedings of the commissioners, revealing the bitterness of the factions, drafts or original records of certain courts, forming the only proof of the accuracy of the copies of the court books, and three new proceedings of the courts of the Somers Islands Company. One of the latter is evidently a blotter and reveals the methods used in keeping the court book. The quo warranto in English, which was served upon the treasurer and company, would have been of the greatest value had not the original record of the suit in the King\u2019s Bench just been discovered. Another document of great value is the receipt referred to above, which proves that a court book was regularly kept by the company from its very beginning. It reveals how much has been lost. The series, consisting of twenty letters from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar, shows more clearly than any other documents we possess who the real managers of the affairs were and what was the spirit of the Sandys faction. The absolute confidence which Sir Edwin Sandys had in John Ferrar and his great love for both of the brothers is significant. Moreover, the knowledge of the affairs of the company, the careful watch over every act and movement affecting the business, the deep and earnest plans for the advancement of its interests revealed in these letters prove that Sir Edwin Sandys was the keen financial manager of the undertaking. It was evidently he who determined what the policy should be; he was apparently the statesman.  \n@ List of Records, Nos. 76, 138, 164, 258, 259, 303, 304, 394, 421, 423, 470, 479, 539, 541, 543, and the quo warranto.  \n\u00bb For these letters see [ibid., Nos. 120, 131, 135, 136, 171, 181, 191, 197, 211, 219, 271, 275, 282, 307, 315, 316, 317, 364, 368.",

Much of the personal feeling and animosity that existed is here shown, and much also which reveals actual financial conditions. The last group of these papers comprises thirty-five letters, all but one or two of which were written by planters or adventurers, resident in the colony, to Sir Edwin Sandys.* Of these, five came from Governor Yeardley, ten from either John Pory or George Thorpe, secretaries in the colony at different times, and two from the cape merchant; of the remainder, at least ten are from colonists whose opinions and reports have not reached us in any other way. These letters are as full of complaint with regard to the insufficient supplies sent with new planters, as are the letters in the Manchester papers which Sir Nathaniel Rich and the Earl of Warwick used as a basis of accusation against the management of the company, but they differ from the other complaints in that they are kindly in spirit. Mr. Pory\u2019s letters are full of definite information concerning the affairs, needs, and hopes of the colony, while Governor Yeardley also gives some valuable statements with regard to new settlers, the council, the relations with the Indians, and the government of the colony; both complain of the scant provisioning of the new settlers. The burden of the Yeardley letters, however, is the investigation of the affairs of Captain Argall and the consequent criticism drawn upon himself from Lord Rich. Unfortunately, comparatively few additional data are afforded concerning the Argall affair either by Pory or by Yeardley. The planters themselves tell much of their condition and of the districts in which they have settled, but the theme of their letters is most likely to be a demand for promised payments or a complaint as to the scarcity of provisions and clothes. The attitude toward Yeardley is generally favorable, John Rolfe alone supporting Argall and criticizing the governor. As from all correspondence of such a character, new ideas are gained, new points of view, and often additional knowledge of relations with the Indians and with one another. Many of these letters are annotated by John Ferrar, revealing the degree of importance which he attached to their various and often conflicting statements.\n\nPUBLIC RECORD OFFICE\u2014MANCHESTER PAPERS\n\nA class of documents, very similar in character but of quite different spirit, is the Manchester papers, now in the Public Record Office, London. Robert, Earl of Warwick, and his cousin, Sir Nathaniel Rich, were both members of the company. \n\n* For these letters, see List of Records, Nos. 93, 94, 115, 119, 184, 153, 156, 158, 166, 173, 179, 180, 235, 238, 239, 241, 243-250, 252-255, 285, 343, 466."
