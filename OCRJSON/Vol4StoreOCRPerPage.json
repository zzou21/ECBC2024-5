    "11": "Preface\n\nThe records of the Virginia Company during the first three months of the years\nfrom January, 1622/23 to January, 1824/25, picture the final attempts to regulate\nand develop the tobacco trade with Virginia. Then follow papers revealing the\nbitter attack upon the Earl of Southampton and the adventurers associated with\nhim, by Sir Nathaniel Rich and the defenders of Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s regime,\nThroughout the whole period are portrayed the struggle of the planiation to recover\nfrom the Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, and the efforts made by the\nofficials in London and by the Governor, Council, and Assembly in Virginia.\n\nThe most important and perhaps unique document of the entire series published\nin volumes IIT and TV of the Reeords of the Virginia Company is the Records of Pros\nceedings upan Tnformation of Que Warranto in the Court of King\u2019s Beneh, found by\nthe editor in the Public Record Office, London. It, alone, covers one hundred pages\nof volume IV. The largest number of documents come from the Afanuseript\nRecords of the Virginia Company, Volume IIT, Like volumes L and II, comprising\nthe minutes of the London company, it is deposited in the Library of Congress,\nWashington, Distriet of Columbia, Tn it are spread the ollicial papers of the\nGovernor, Council and Assembly of Virginia, They include letters to and from\nthe officers of the Virginia Company of London, comiuuissions issued, orders declired,\npetitions granted, warrants for clections, statements of the condition of the eolony\nand other documents revealing the bistory of the plantation.\n\nA long series of papers shedding much light on the terrifie conflict within the\nCompany, resulting in its dissolution by Quo Warranto proceedings, comes from\nthe Manchester Papees, now in the Publie Record Office, Londen, being largely\nletters and memoranda of Sir Nathaniel Rich.\n\nThe Colonial Office Papers in the Publie Record Office, the Ferrar Papers, and\nthe Papers of Lord Sackville, now deposited at Knole Park, Kent, each supplied a\nnumber of important documents.\n\nIn this volume, then, is to be found the record of the dissension within the\ncompany that brought about the close of the corporation and the end of the first\nperiod of the colony\u2019s history, At the same time the beginning of Virginia as a\nerown colony is set forth. Here also is portrayed the settled life of the phintntion.\nMuch is told of the colonists and their efforts to create an organized and systematic\ngovernment, to produce commodities that would provide the necessities for living,\nand to develop resources that might result in needful trade with the Indians and\nwith England.\n\n",
    "12": "Two documents of importance, inadvertently omitted at first, but now numbered\nCCOXLYV A and CDANXAVULA, will be found, not in their chronolagicsl place,\nbut at the end of the volume, as Addenda,\n\nThe editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Dr. Hubert Hall for his labors\nin Supervising the transeript of the Quo Warranto Proceedings and in translating\nthe entire document.\n\nAsin the previous volume, the editor is deeply indebted to Professor 4. Franklin\nAnimeson for his continued enre in secing the document through the press; to Marian\nCorter Anderson for her assistance in preparing the manuseript for the press and in\nthe difficulties of reading the proof. Tlelen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the\nindex for this volume as she did for Volume II], and to her again the editar wishes\nto express appreciation of her contribution.\n\nA part of the expense of arranging the manuscript, reading the proof, and\nmaking the index was met by a grant from the Social Science Research Couneil.\n\nDecerspen 1, 1934.

    "57": "MARCH (?), 123 33\n\nFor it is necessarie to be knowne, that the Counsell, Comittees and Com-\npanics having first concluded on the Offices necessarie for the menaging\nof this Contract, as also of their rewardes by way of Sallarie (according\nto the fifte Article of the Contract): The Officers themselves were lastly\nchosen in both the Courts: and the burthen was imposed upon the chiefe\nof them, in a free and unanimous eleccion, contrary to their most earnest\nand often iterated desires,\n\nIt is also further to be knowne, that by reason of these troubles,\nboth the chiefe Officers and divers of the Comittees having voluntarily\nsurrendred their places, and greatly importuned the Courts, to accept\nof their Surrenders; yet the same have beene refused, and they continued\nin their offices, much contrary to their wills, and most earnest suits,\nwhereas contrariwise these Articles are propounded in that manner, as\nthough the Officers had bin ambitious of this imployment, and conse-\nquently were to undertake it with all indignities. Then whieh noething\ncan be more untrue and unjust.\n\n1. To the first Article it is answered, that the matter therein conteyned\nis allready regulated in the Quarter Courts of bothe the Companies.\nAnd that the Officers or Agents of the companies have noe more to doe\nin the bringing in of the Varinaes Tobacco, then any other perticuler\nmember that liste to adventure his stuck therein: By which order of the\nsaid Quarter Courts, it is declared that the perticuler Adventurers for\nthe said Varinaes Tobacco are to bring in the proporcion expressed by\nthe Contract: the Bodies of the Campanies bearing a tenth part with\nthem. But in case of any misfortune by losse of their Tobaceo without\nthe default of the said Adventurers, they are not to be farther charged\nalso with restitucion or recomipence: but the same is to rest upon the\nwhole body of the Comipanies, and consequently to be answered out. of\nthe Companies publique Stocks: and if these should not suffice, then out\nof the stocks of the Generall Adventurers returned from the Plantations,\nas heretofore in like cases had beene usually done.\n\n2. In the second Article, the Question is likewise resolved by bothe the\nQuarter Courts; vizt. that generally the Adventurers and Planters, both\nfor price and payment, are to goe in equall lines: Neither of which are to\nbe ordered or concluded by the officers, but by the Generall Courts them-\n\n",
    "58": "34 RECORDS OF TILE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nselves; the matter being first seriously debated and prepared by the\nComittees. And in favour of the poorer sorte of Planters, there have\nbeene divers other wayes devised and resolved upon, by the generall\nconsent of bothe the Courts; beth for the advancing of their prices, and\nexpediting of their payments.\n\n3. To the third Article it is answered, that it is grounded wholy upon\nerrors, An error it is, to conceave that the rating of charges, is in the\npower of the Officers: being reserved (as all other important matters) to\nthe Generall Courts. An error it is, to thinke, that the labour of the\nOfficers, consisteth wholy or chiefly in the matter of Sale: the well 1en-\naging of the Contract extending itselfe in the difficulties thereof to a\nmuch larger Compasse. And lastly it is an error and misinformacion,\nto suy that the Salaries amount unto five and twenty hundred poundes:\nwhereas they come but to Seaventeene hundred poundes. But to the\nmatter itselfe of this article, the answere is not difheult. For the charges\nto be imposed wilbe lighter or heavier according to the proporcion greater\nor lesser of Tobaceo to be brought in, and that with this comfort both to\nAdventurers and Planters that the greatnes of the quantity will diminishe\nihe perticnler charge; and the smallues of the quantity will enhance the\ngenerall price.\n\nBut whereas there is mencion made of the selling the Tobacco together,\nit is to be observed that the course thereof lately propounded, by these\nObjeectors, is subject to Fraude and much wrong both to the IKinge\nand Companies: vizt. that certaine Undertakers, being members of the\nCompanies, should rayse a greate Stock in money, to buy of all the\nTobacco by way of whole Sale. For considering the courts in the vaca-\ncious are often times very thinne, and the Somer Tandes Court by the\nLetters Pattents may consiste of Highte persons onely: these Under-\ntakers may easily attayne to be the greater parte of the Courts, and con-\nsequently may be both Buyers and Sellers at the same time. A feare\nnot eauseles, but grounded on former experience; whereby some of these\nOhjectors have made themselves rich, by the great losse and detriment\nof the Adventurers and Companies.\n\n",
    "59": "MARCH (?), 1623 35\n\nTo the 4th Article the answere is, that the Court have allready ordered\nthat the Custome and freight shalbe diseharged by the Officers, who are\nto be secured from damage by the goodes in their custody.\n\n5. To the 5 article it is likewise answered that the Courts with General\nconsent (onely one dissenting) have taken full order for seeurity both of\ngoodes and money: which orders have beene read before the Lord Trens-\nuror, and wee suppose they are more exquisite for caution on ull sides,\nthen are used in anie other Company whatsoever, as at the making o\nthen: was openly acknowledged. The perticularities whereof are to\nlong to be here sett downe: but are ready to be shewen to any that shal\ndesire to see them. Whereunto wee may add a strict oath, which is to\nbe administred to all the Officers of what degree soever, for just and\nequall dealing, both in keeping, preserving, selling and accompting for\nthe goodes; as also in making the paymnts at such time as they shal\ngrowe due whercin the Officers also from time to time are to be directed\nby the Courts.\n\n6. To the Sixte Article, it is answered, that by vertue of the Contract,\nthe Proclamation mencioned was presently to come forth. But upon\nmocion from the Lord Treasuror, the Companies have consented, that\nit may be forborne till the Twentith of June: at which time the Lord\nTreasurer hath promised that it shalbe published. Of the performance\nof whose promise, though the Propounder here seeme to make soe great\ndoubt; yet the Companies will make none at all: and therefore hold it\nunfitt to follow the Propounders stepps any further; in which it seemeth\nthat jealousy hath outrun their duety.\n\n7. To the Seayenth it is answered that the Officers are to he aecomptable\nfor all charges, if five and twenty hundreth poundes will serve, the re-\nmayne is to be restored. If more he necessary, that which wants must.\nagayne be leavied. That the Officers out of their owne estates, should\nbeare those uncertaine burthens, of desperate debts, suits in hawe, shrink-\nage and the like, is soe farr not onely from Equitie, but from all ordinarie\nreason, that they hope the Propounders themselves upon better cousider-\nacion will retract the Question.\n\n",

For\nthe Twelve pence on the pound amounted to much more then the vallue\nof one entire halfe, not onely of the meaner, but also of the muddle sort\nthereof as experience hath shewed.\n\n9. To the Ninth Article, which layeth aspersions on the Officers\u2019 persons,\nthe Answere is pluine. The two chiefe Officers were chosen by the Ballat-\ning hox with 63 votes for them, and not above five against them. The\nKighte Comittees were chosen by ereecion of handes out of the normber of\nSixteene, named by the Courts to stand for the places: In which nomber\nof Sixteene, were divers of these objectors.

Of which Bighte, six have beene yearely chosen\nComiittees and Assistants for these Three yeares last past; neither amy\njust execepeion can be taken to any of therm by mindes unpossessed with\npartiallity or mallice, neither are the companies to be blamed in this er\nother their eleecions, if they have rather made choise to entrust their\nGoodes in the hands of men untainted for integritie and honesty. then in\ntheires, whose wisdome hath beene for their owne pertieulur benefitt,\nwho in their former menagements of Tobacco have reduced Seaven thow-\nsand poundes sterling to Fower thowsand poundes, and who never yet\ngave up any faire account of the Companie\u2019s goodes.\n\n[Indorsed:}| Aunsweare to eerten Propositions exhibited to the Lord\nTreasuror concerning the Contract.\n\n",
