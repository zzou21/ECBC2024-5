    "11": "[Refer ks\n\nNote\n\nIn 1906 the Library of Congress published, in two quarto volumes entitled \u201cThe\nRecords of the Virginia Company of London,\u201d the text, from the manuscript in\nthe Library, of the Court Book containing the minutes of that company\u2019s mectings,\nand of the meetings of its council, from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624, together\nwith an elaborate and learned introduction by Miss Susan Myra Kingsbury, now\nprofessor of social economy in Bryn Mawr College, and a list prepared by her of\nadditional documents illustrative of the company\u2019s history from the date of its\nchartering until after its dissolution by the Crown and the consequent conclusion\nof its business, These documents, 764 in number, are listed, with bibliographical\nreferences as to their sources, in the section of Miss Kingsbury\u2019s first, volume\n(pp. 119-205) entitled \u2018List of Records.\u201d The project of publication formed at the\ntime when those volumes were issued contemplated the printing, in additional\nvolumes, of the documents thus listed, or of all those among them that had any\nhistorical significance. Their texts are now to be presented, in two volumes num-\nbered III, IV, of The Records of the Virginia Company of London. The texts\nhave been prepared by Miss Kingsbury with great care and accuracy. The first\n273 of the documents arranged for publication are presented in the present volume.\nA nearly equal number, completing the series, will be presented in Volume IV, now\nin the printer\u2019s hands. The two volumes will constitute an addition of great magni-\ntude, and of the highest interest, to the materials for the early history of Virginia, and\ntheir preparation, distinctly a labor of love on the part of Miss Kingsbury, places all\nfuture students of that history under a heavy debt of gratitude to their accomplished\neditor.\n\nHerpert Putnam,\nLibrarian of Congress.\nVv\n",

    "13": "Prefare\n\nThe documents contained in Volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia\nCompany of London are original papers, official and other, of (he company or relating\ntoit. While the Court Book of the Virginia Company, published as Volumes I and II\nof this series, presents minutes of the meetings of the corporation, the sueceeding\nvolumes contain materials that vivify its decisions and decrees, explain the difficulties\nmet and overcome by that redoubtable group of adventurers, reveal the petty jeal-\nousies of the administrators, and especially record the controversy between the\ncompany and the Crown that resulted in the dissolution of the corporation and the\nereation of the first erown colony of Great Britain.\n\nFour official sets of records are herein printed or cited. Two are published in full.\nOne set is the original papers contained in the volume, now preserved in the Library\nof Congress, which has long been referred to as \u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia\nCompany, Volume III.\u201d One set embodies records of action in law courts by the\ncompany or against the company. \u2018They are taken from the records of the various\nBritish courts and were found in the Public Record Office. Two sets are not here\nincluded as originally planned. They have been published in full since this series\nwas begun. One is the \u201cCourte Booke\u201d of the colony, February 4, 1622/23, through\nFebruary 9, 1632/33. Jt is now printed under the title \u201cMinutes of the Council and\nGeneral Court of Colonial Virginia,\u201d edited by Dr. H. L. McIlwaine (Richmond, Va.,\n1924), The other set of documents has been published in the \u2018Acts of the Privy\nCouncil, Colonial\u201d, volume I (London, 1908). Some actions of the council that\nconcerned the Virginia Company of London are not to be found in that publication.\nThey are therefore here printed. The collection called the Sackville Papers, dis-\ncussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I, page\n114, was, by the courtesy of the third Lord Sackville, examined by Prof. A. Percival\nNewton, of the University of London, and the documents relating to Virginia were\nprinted in 1922 in the American Historical Review, Volume XXVII, pages 493 to\n538 and 738 to 765. Those bearing dates earlier than 1623 are not here reprinted.\n\nIncluded in this volume are manuscripts from two collections that are unique.\nThe \u201cSmyth of Nibley\u201d papers give the history of a single settlement, called Smyth\u2019s\n(or Smith\u2019s) Hundred, that is typical of the verious hundreds of the colony. They\nextend from February 3, 1618/19, to August 1, 1622, inclusive. These papers are all in\nthe New York Publie Library. The \u2018\u2018Ferrar Papers,\u2019\u2019 on the other hand, now belong-\ning to Magdalene College, Cambridge University, are a veritable gold mine; their\nunique value is discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company,\nVolume J, They supply a vast amount of information through the correspondence\nbetween the colony and individual planters of the colony and Sir Edwin Sandys,\nNicholas Ferrar, and John Ferrar, and also between Sir Edwin Sandys and the other\nofficials of the company. Only a few documents are official, including two reports\nfrom the council in Virginia, a record of a Somers Islands court, and some less impor-\ntant iterns of this type. The first paper bears the date June 8, 1617, and the last\n\nNovember 1, 1624. But only a few go beyond midsummer of 1622.\nVI\n",
    "14": "vit PREFACE\n\nOn the other hand, the \u2018\u2018Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume\nIIT,\u201d do not begin until August 12, 1621, but continue throughout the life of the com-\npany. They differ in character from the Smyth of Nibley Papers and the Terrar\nPapers. Asstated above, they record official acts of the council in Virginia and include\ncommissions, proclamations, orders, laws, letters to and from the council in London,\nand petitions to the governor and council in Virginia.\n\nCommunications between the company and the Kingor the privy council, and some\nletters to and from the governor and council of the colony, were spread on the minutes\nof the company, and therefore appear in Volumes I and II, of this series. They are\nnoi reproduced in Volumes HI and LV, even though the original documents are found\nin the other collections.\n\nAll documents here published are discussed at Jength in the Introduction to Vol-\numes I and II of this series. Practically every paper indicated as to be included in\nthe series by the star affixed in the \u2018List of Records\u201d that appears in the Introduction\nto Volume I is here printed. Two documents (List of Records No. 70 and No. 153)\ncould not be found, and it has proved impossible to secure a copy of No. 12,\n\nFifty-seven documents dating earlier than April 28, 1619, when the records in\nVolume I begin, are printed in this volume. They inchide all records that had not\nheretofore been known or published by Alexander Brown, the Virginia Magazine\nof History, or other reliable works on the early history of Virginia. Perhaps the\nmost important documents found by the editor that are here included are the\n\u201cTnstruc\u00e9ons Orders and Constitu\u00e9ons to S' Thomas Gates knight Governor of\nVirginia\u201d of May, 1609, and the \u2018Instructions orders and constitu\u00e9ons ... to...\nS* Thomas West knight Lo: La Warr,\u201d 1609/10, by the Virginia Council. These\nare the first instructions given by the competent authority to a British colony.\n\nSource material for the history of the company through the year 1622 is presented\nin this volume. March 22, 1622, saw the frightful massacre of colonists by the\nIndians. The story of that tragedy, the efforts for recovery, and the beginning of the\nreestablished colony conclude this volume.\n\nThe editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, chief\nof the division of manuscripts in the Library of Congress, for his painstaking care in\nreading the proof to the original documents of the \u2018\u201cManuseript Records of the\nVirginia Company, Volume III,\u201d and to some of the photostats of material in England,\nand also for his constant watchfulness in seeing the documents through the press.\n\nTo Marian Carter Anderson the editor is indebted for her valuable and expert\nassistance in preparing much of the manuscript, and especially in the difficult reading\nof practically all of the proof.\n\nHelen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index of Volume III, and to her the\neditor wishes to express gratitude for the complete and accurate contribution she has\nmade to the usefulness of the documents in historical research.\n\nA part of the expense for reading the proof and the cost of preparing the index\nwere met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council.\n\nJun 30, 1932.

But forasmuche as men\u2019s affaires doe little prosper where God\u2019s\nservice is neglected, all the Burgesses tooke their places in the Quire till\na prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the Minister, that it would please God\nto guide and sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and the good\nof this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the intente that as we had\nbegun at God Almighty, so we might proceed with awful and due respecte\ntowards the Lieutenant, our most gratious and dread Soveraigne, all the\nBurgesses were intreatted to retyre themselves into the body of the\nChurche, which being done, before they were fully admitted, they were\nealled in order and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it)\ntooke the oathe of Supremacy, and entred the Assembly. At Captaine\nWarde the Speaker tooke exception, as at one that without any Comis-\nsion or authority had seatted himselfe either upon the Companics, and\nthen his Plantation would not be lawfull, or on Captain Martin\u2019s lande,\nand so he was but a limbe or member of him, and there could be but two\nBurgesses for all.

And in case he doe neglect this he is to stande to\nthe censure of the nexte general assembly. To this Captaine Warde, in\nthe presence of us all, having given his consente and undertaken to per-\nforme the same was, together with his Lieutenant, by voices of the whole\nAssembly first admitted to take the oath of Supremacy, and then to make\nup their number and to sitt amongst them.\n\nThis being done, the Governor himselfe alledged that before we proceeded\nany further it behooved us to examine whither it were fitt, that Captaine\nMartin\u2019s Burgesses shoulde have any place in the Assembly, forasmuche as\nhe hath a clause in his Patente which doth not onely exempte him from\nthat equality and uniformity of lawes and orders which the great charter\nsaith are to extende over the whole Colony, but also from diverse such\nlawes as we must be enforced to make in the General Assembly. That\nclause is as followeth: Item. That it shall and may be lawfull to and for\nthe said Captain John Martin, his heyers, executours and assignes to\ngoverne and comaunde all suche person or persons as at this time he\nshall carry over with him, or that shalbe sente him hereafter, free from any\ncomaunde of the Colony, excepte it be in ayding and assisting the same\nagainst any forren or domestical enemy.\n\nUpon the motion of the Governor, discussed the same time in the assembly,\nensued this order following:\n\nAn order of the General Assembly touching a clause in Captain Martin\u2019s\nPatent at James Citty, July 30, 1619.\n\nAfter all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted\ninto the house and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain Martin\u2019s\nPatent was produced by the Governor out of a Clause whereof it appeared\nthat when the general assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for\nthe whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole\ncompany and chuse whether they would obay the same or no, It was\ntherefore ordered in Courte that the foresaid two Burgesses should withdraw\nthemselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had made\nhis personall appearance before them. At what time, if upon their motion,\nif he would be contente to quitte and give over that parte of his Patente,\n",

(as the said Thomas Davis deposed upon\noathe,) that they had made a harde voiage, had they not mett with a Canoa\ncoming out of a creeke where their shallop could not goe.

For which\nconsiderations and because suche outrages as this might breede danger and\nloss of life to others of the Colony which should have leave to trade in the\nbaye hereafter, and for prevention of the like violenees against the In-\ndians in time to come, this order following was agreed on by the general\nassembly:\n\nA second order against Captain Martin, at James cttty, July 80, 1619.\n\nIt was also ordered by tlie Assembly the same day in case Captaine Martin\nand the ging of his shallop would not thoroughly answere an accusation of\nan outrage committed gainst a certaine Conoa of Indians in the haye, that\nthen it was thought reason (his Patent notwithstanding, the authority\nwhereof he had in that case abused) he should from henceforth take leave\nof the Governour as other men, and should putt in security, that his people\nshall comitte no such outrage any more.\n\n1282--3. 12\n\n",

Which for the more ease of the Committies, having\ndivided into fower books, he read the former two the same forenoon for\nexpeditions sake, a second time over, and so they were referred to the\nperusall of twoe Committies, which did reciprocally consider of either, and\naccordingly brought in their opinions. But some may here objecte to what\nende we should presume to referre that to the examination of Committies\nwhich the Counsell and Company in England had already resolved to be\nperfect, and did expect nothing but our assente thereunto.

And to the ende that no man might\ndoe or suffer any wrong in this kinde, that they woulde favour us so muche\n(if they meane to graunte this our petition) as to sende us notice, what\ncomission or authority for graunting of landes they have given to eache\nparticular Governour in times paste.\n\nThe second petition of the General assembly framed by the Committies out\nof the second book is.

At the same\ntime, there remaining no farther scruple in the mindes of the Assembly\ntouching the said great Charter of lawes, orders and priviledges, the Speaker\nputt the same to the question, and so it had both the gencral assent and the\napplause of the whole assembly, who, as they professed themselves in the\nfirst place most submissively thankful to almighty god, therefore so they\ncommaunded the Speaker to returne (as nowe he doth) their due and hum-\nble thankes to the Treasurer Counsell and company for so many priviledges\nand favours as well in their owne names as in the names of the who!e Colony\nwhom they represented.\n",

His answere was that he had not as yet received any suche\norder from the Adventurers of the in England. And notwithstanding he\nsawe the authority was good, yet was he unwilling to yield, till suche time\nas the Governor and Assembly had layd their commandment upon him,\nout of the authority of the foresaid Instructions as followeth:\n\nBy the General Assembly.\n\nWe will and require you, Mr. Abraham Persey, Cape Marchant, from this\ndaye forwarde to take notice, that, according to an article in the Instruc-\ntions confirmed by the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in Englande at\na general quarter courte, both by voices and under their hands and the\nComon seall, and given to Sir George Yeardley, knight, this present\ngovernour, Decemb. 3, 1618, that you are bounde to accepte of the Tobacco\nof the Colony, either for commodities or upon billes, at three shillings the\nbeste and the second sorte at 18d the punde, and this shalbe your sufficient\ndischardge.\n\nJames citty out of the said General Assembly, July 31, 1619.\n\nAt the same the Instructions convertible into lawes were referred to the\nconsideration of the above named Committies, viz., the general Instructions\nto the first Committie and the particular Instructions to the second, to\nbe returned by them into the assembly on Munday morning.\n\nSunday, Aug. 1.\nMr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased.\nMunday, Aug. 2.\n\nCaptain John Martin (according to the sumons sent him on Fryday,\nJuly 30,) made his personall appearance at the barre, whenas the Speaker\nhaving first read unto him the orders of the Assembly that concerned him,\n",

Sir George Yeardley, I\nthinke, would not robb Captaine Argall of my lordes loue, for he hath in\nhim to deserue muche; nor would he haue his lo? to haue spent so muche\nloue upon any man in vaine; but onely doth wishe that Captain Argall\nbeing riche, a Bachelour, and deuoid of chardge, would not so excessively *\nintende his owne thrifte. As touching Sir George his intereepting of my\nletters, his lo? I knowe (so noble is he) will not be implacable. And on\nthe other side, I knowe not howe he will interpret that w\u00ae hath bene\nwritten concerning the Treasurer (w\u2122 Argall called his ship, while she was\nhere) or concerning Spelmans vnaduised using of his lo\u201d* name to Opo-\nchancano. Meane while in the dangers wherein the Colony stood, Sir\nGeorge thought himselfe vnworthy of a remedy, vnlessc he had sett dewne\nthe truth of the case. What tempestes that answere of his by the Diana,\nand those other letters then and since haue raised in your court, I doe\nalmost fear to think of. Without his comandement I did nothing [2]\nand that w** I did, he viewed and reuiewed still to a syllable.

But if we be blamed for doing part\nof our duty, then what should we haue bene, if we had done all?

The\nMasts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and\nSope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, (being the materials of Linnen,) which\nnow we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to\nbe had in abundance and great perfection.

The Wines,\nFruite, and Salt of France and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will\nbe found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferiour. We omit\nhere a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dispersed vp and downe\nthe diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent\nDyes: of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall scruice: of sweet\nWoods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: of Cotten-wooll,\nand Suger Canes: all which may there also be had in abundance, with an\ninfinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle\nand Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of\nour Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great\nplenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Grae of that Countrey, doth\nfarre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength, and fertility. The Cattle which\nwe haue transported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred)\nbecome much bigger of Body, then the [4] breed from which they came:\nThe Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the\nextraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde\ntwo Fawnes ata birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd,\nbeing within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of\nNew-found-Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour.

The people are all\ndiuided [5] into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land\ndue to him set out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publike\nLands for the Company here, for the Gouernour there, for the College, and\nfor each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and for diuers other\nnecessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The\nparticular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are setled in their\nSeates, being allotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance.\nThe rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is\nreduced within the limits prescribed by his Maiestie: and the laudable\nforme of Tustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and\nfollowed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil\nioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue\nspeedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly\nhath, partly is bound to haue in short time a sufficient Minister: for whom\nmaintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value.\nWhich orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused\nthe Colony now at length to settle themselues in a firme resolution to\nperpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his\nowne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest-houses,\nfor entertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp\ntheir Ploughes; to the planting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple\nCommodities furnished and commended from henee. In summe, they are\nnow so full of alacritie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall Assembly,\nthey haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes\nto the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the set[6]ling of\nthe Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene\nhad here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires\nof the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice.\nWherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authoritie and\npleasure, there hath beene a collection made of all the branches of the\nsame, dispersed in his Letiers Patents, now three times renewed: as also\nout of other Instructions proceeding from his Maiestie.

The like may be said of our owne Swine and Goats,\nwhereof they haue vsed to kill eight in tenne more than the English haue\ndone.

By these and sundry\nother wayes, as by driuing them (when they flye) vpon their enemies,\nwho are round about them, and by animating and abetting their enemies\nagainst them, may their ruine or subiection be soone effected.\n\nSo the Spaniard made great vse for his owne turne of the quarrels and\nenmities that were amongst the Indians, as throughly vnderstanding and\nfollowing that Maxime of the Politician, Diude & impera, Make diuisions\nand take Kingdomes: For thus he got two of the greatest Kingdomes of\nthe West Indies, Peru and [25] Mexico, by the Princes diuisions, and the peo-\nples differences. After the death of Guainacapa king of Peru, his sonnes\nAttabalippa and Gascar falling to war about the kingdom, & each of th\u00e9\nstriuing to make the Spaniard to his friend, Francis Pizzarro managing\nthose their diuisions onely to his owne ends, easily stripped them both of\nthat rich Kingdome, and became Master of Peru. And so likwise Ferdz-\nnando Cortez vanquished King Motezuma, and gained the Kingdome of\nMexico from him, by the aid and furtherance of the neighboring people\nof the Prouince of T'ascala, being deadly enemies to the Mexicans; for\nwhich seruice they of Tascala are freed by the Spaniards from all Tributes\nto this time.

And by these factions and differ-\nences of petty Princes, the Romans tooke their greatest aduantage to\nouercome this Iland of Great Britayne, of which Tacitus sayes, Ita dum\nsinguli pugnant vniuerst vincuntur.

Besides (before they\nknew the cause and remedy) very many lost diuers parts of their body,\nfeet and hands principally, by a little vermine lesse then a Flea, and\nskipping like it, called Nigua, which got between the skinne and the flesh\nbefore they were aware, and there bred and multiplyed, making swellings\nand putrefactions, to the decay and losse of their bodily members.\n",
    "599": "1622 561\n\nWhat should I tell you that the Plantations diucrs times were neare\nvndone, by the ambition, factions, and malice of the Commanders one\nvnto another. Columbus, to whom they were beholding for all, with his\nbrothers, were sent home from the West Indies into Spaine bound with\nchaines: and some other great Commanders killed and murthered one\nanother. Pizzarro was killed by Almagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded,\nwhich Vasco was taken by Blasco, and this Blasco was likewise taken by\nPizzarroes brother. Thus by their owne spightfull and auaritious quarrels\ndid they well-neare shake the mayne pillars of that Plantation.\n\nThese and many other calamities and mischiefes, too long to relate now,\nhapned vnto them more then euer did to vs. And at one time their planta-\ntion was euen at the last gaspe, all their Colony being resolued desperately\nto leaue it, had not two ships vnexpected come in with new supplyes:\nyet wee see for all these miseries, that they haue attained to their ends at\nlast, Honor, power, and wealth; In so much as that Countrey, which\n(when they were dishartned with disasters) they beganne to be so weary of,\nthat they were about to forsake it all, in short time after (seeing all stormes\nblowne ouer, and fayre weather shining vpon them) they were so in loue\nwith their great fortunes, that they grew so icalous of them, as made them\nshut them vp from the sight of any but themselues. And then they peti-\ntioned their King, by an inuiolable Decree to annexe and vnite the West\nIndies inseparably for euer to the Crowne of Spaine; which (for their\nbetter securitie and satisfaction) was accordingly performed and ratified, as\nit is to be seene in Hereras His[30]tory of the West Indies. And whereas\nbefore, few could be hired to go to inhabite there, now with great suite\nthey must obtaine it.\n\nThus haue they in time by industry, patience, and constancy effected\nthis great worke of theirs, notwithstanding to encrease their difficulties\nalso, they were to deale with a most populous & numerous nation, which\nthey ouereame at last: So as Oudedo in his third Booke of the first Part\nof his West Indie History saith, that of a million of Indians at least, that\nwere in Hispaniola, there were not (in little more than forty yeares space\nafter the first beginning of the Plantation) fiue hundred of th\u00e9 & all their\nchildren liuing: for the Indians that liued there, after were brought out of\nthe Continent into that Tland, or out of one Tland to be planted in another.\n",
    "600": "562 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nOn the other side, the Natiues in VIRGINIA are nothing populous, but\nthin and scattered Nations, as is knowne to all.\n\nHere by the way to make a little Digression, since I haue mentioned Ouiedo\nwho liued aboue twenty two yeares in the West Indies, I will acquaint\nyou with bis obseruation and iudgement of the nature and disposition of\nthe Indians there, that you may compare and see in what, and how farre,\nit agrees with that of the Natiues of VIRGINIA.\n\nThey are (saith hee) by nature sloathfull and idle, vitious, melancholy,\nslouenly, of bad conditions, lyers, of small memory, of no constancy or\ntrust. In another place he saith, The Indian is by nature of all people\nthe most lying and most ineonstant in the world, sottish and sodaine:\nneuer looking what dangers may happen afterwards, lesse capable then\nchildren of sixe [31] or seauen yeares old, and lesse apt and ingenious. This\nis the generall disposition of most of them, though there be some (sayes he)\nthat. be wise and subtill. And indeede it should seeme so, when they could\nouerreach and goe beyond the Spaniard so much, to put that tricke of\nstaruing them (as aforesaid) vpon them, to their so great and almost totall\ndestruction.\n\nBut to come againe to that which I first intended: Since the Spaniard (as\nwe see) in his Plantations hath gone thorow farre more hazards, and\ngreater difficulties then euer wee haue had, we therefore in looking to what\nis past, vpon great reason ought likewise not to be deterred, but so much\nthe rather inuited to proceede with constancy and courage. And if\nbesides wee looke (as most men doe) after the riches of a Countrey to\ninuite vs on, aske those that haue beene there, and haue trauelled farre\nand neare, and they will tell you, that no Countrey in the world doth\nnaturally abound with more Commodities then VIRGINIA doth. The\nClymate is knowne to be more temperate, and the soyle more rich then that\nof the West Indies is: neyther doth it want mynes of all sorts, no not of the\nrichest, as is knowne to some now liuing, and shall be manifested when\nfit time shall serue. And yet to thinke that Gold and Siluer mynes are\nin a Countrey (otherwise most rich and fruitfull) the greatest wealth of a\nPlantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, That the\nGold and Siluer is the greatest wealth of the West Indies now at this\npresent time. True it is indeed, that in the first Conquest the Spaniards\n",
    "601": "1622 563\n\ngot great and mighty treasure from the Indians, which they in long space\nhad heaped vp together, [82] and in those times the Indians shewed them\nentyre and plentifull rich mynes, which by length of time (as is well known\nand published to the world by those that haue beene there) are wasted\nand exhausted since, so as now the charge of getting those mettals is\ngrowne most excessiue, besides the consuming and spoyling many men of\ntheir liues, which are depriued of them by the vapors that come out of the\nGold and Siluer mynes, which are most pestilent and deadly, as diuers\nauthors auerre. Amongst others, a late Geographer speaking of the West\nIndies, and of those mynes there, saith, Odor ex auri & argenti fodinis noxius\nadmodum; neq; tamen prohibuit a\u00e9ris corruptissimi violentia Hispanos, ne\nin alto orbe nouum moriendi locum quaeerent. So as all things considered\nby these mynes, what by the liues of many men lost in them, and what\nwith the great charge otherwise in getting them, the cleare gaine to the\nAduenturers from these mettals (the Kings part defrayed) is but small! to\nthem, nothing neere so much I am sure, as is imagined. And were it not\nfor other rich Commodities there that enable and enrich the Aduenturers,\nthose of the Contractation house were neuer able to subsist by this. Tor\nthe greatest part of their gaine and profit I say consists not in these mynes,\nbut in their other Commodities, partly natiue, and partly translated from\nother parts of the world, and planted in the West Indies: As in their mighty\nwealth of Sugars (the Sugar-Canes being transported first from the Ca-\nnaries,) and in Ginger, and some other commodities deriucd from the\nEast Indies thither: in their Cochanile, their Indico, their Cotton, their\ninfinite store of Hydes and Skins, [33] their Quick-siluer, and Allom, Woad,\nand Brasillwood, &c. And their many other Dyes, Paints, Petacaraua,\nTobacco, Gummes, Balmes, Oyles medecinall, and Perfumes, their Sar-\nsaparillia, and many other physicall drugs, (for which, learned Physitians\nand skilfull Simplers were sent to take a suruey, and make an exquisite\ndraught of all the Plants in colours.) These I say and other the like com-\nmodities are the West Indies indeed vnto the Aduenturers, by which they\nare inabled to inrich themselues, and to sustaine the mighty charge of\ndrawing out the Gold and Siluer, to the great and cleare reuenew of their\n\nKing.\n\nI had many things of importance to say more, but I will detain the Reader\nno longer now. \u2018To conclude then, secing that Virgrnia is most abundantly\n",

Which though it doe manifestly\nproue the fruitfulnesse of the soile, yeelding all kinds of graine or plants\ncommitted vnto it, with a rich and plentifull encrease, yet cannot the\nfatnesse of the earth alone produce such excellent effects, vnlesse the tem-\nperature of the Ayre bee likewise so fauourable, that [46] those tender\nsprouts which the earth doth abundantly bring forth, may bee cherished\nwith moderate heate and seasonable moisture, and freed both from scorching\ndrought, and nipping frost.\n\nThese blessings are so much the more to bee esteemed, because they are\nbestowed vpon a place situated so conueniently, and at so good a distance\nboth from Europe, and the West Indies, that for the mutuall commerce\nbetwixt these great and most rich parts of the habitable world, there\ncannot bee deuised any place more conuenient for the succour and refresh-\ning of those that trade from hence thither: whether they be of our owne\nnation, or of our neighbours and friends; the multitude of great and naui-\ngable Riuvers, and of safe and spacious harbours, as it were inuiting all\nNations to entertaine mutuall friendship, and to participate of those bless-\nings which God out of the abundance of his rich Treasures, hath so\ngratiously bestowed some vpon these parts of Hurope, and others no lesse\ndesired vpon those poore people: which might still haue remained in their\nold barbarous ignorance, without knowledge of their owne misery, or of\nGods infinite goodnesse and mercy; if it had not pleased God thus gratiously\nboth to draw vs thither with desire of such wealth as those fruitfull Coun-\ntries afford, and also to grant vs so easie, certaine, and safe a meanes to\ngoe vuto them: which passage is in mine opinion made much more secure\n",
    "611": "1622 573\n\nand easie by the commodious harbours and refreshing which VIRGINIA\ndoth reach out vnto vs. The coasts of Florida to the West, being not so har-\nborous; and of New England to the East, somewhat more out of the way,\namongst so many [47] Flats and small [lands not so safe. Neither is the com-\nmodiousnesse of VIRGINIAS situation onely in respect of this west Alan-\nticke Ocean, but also in respect of the Indian Ocean, which wee commonly call\nthe South Sea, which lyeth on the West and North west side of VIRGINIA,\non the other side of the Mountains beyond our Fals, and openeth a free and\nfaire passage, not onely to China, Tapan, and the Moluccaes; but also to\nNew Spaine, Peru, Chila, and those rich Countries of Terra Australis, not\nas yet fully discouered. For the Sea wherein Master Hudson did winter,\nwhich was first discouered by him, and is therefore now called Mretum\nHudson, doth stretch so farre towards the west, that it lieth as farre\nwestward as the Cape of Florida: So that from the Fals aboue Henrico\nCity, if we shape our iourney towards the Northwest following the Rivers\ntowards the head, we shall vndoubtedly come to the Mountaines, which\nas they send diuers great Riuers Southward into our Bay of Chesepiock, so\nlikewise doe they send others from their further side Northwestward into\nthat Bay where Hudson did winter. For so wee see in our owne Country,\nfrom the ridge of Mountaines continued from Derbishire into Scotland,\ndoe issue many great Riuers on both sides into the East Germane Ocean,\nand into the Westerne /rzsh Seas: in like sort from the Alpes of Switzerland\nand the Grizons, do runne the Danubie Eastward into Pontus Euxinus, the\nRhene into the North Germane Ocean, the Rhosne west into the Mediterrane\nSea, and the Po South into the Adriatike Sea. This Bay where //udson\ndid winter, strecheth it selfe Southward into 49. degrees, and cannot be in\nprobability so farre dis[48]tant from the Fals as 200. Leagues; part of\nthe way lying by the Riuers side towards the mountaines from whence\nit springeth: and the other part on the other side cannot want Riuers\nlikewise, which will conduct vs all the way, and I hope carry vs and our\nprouisions a good part of it. Besides that Bay, it is not vnlikely that the\nWesterne Sea in some other Creeke or Riuer commeth much neerer then\nthat place: For the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter, lying more\nWesterly then Master Hudsons Bay by 190. Leagues in the same Sea, doth\nextend it selfe very neere as farre towards the west as the Cape of California,\n\nwhich is now found to be an Iland stretching it selfe from 22. degrees to 42.\n1982-3338\n",

Which relations are cunningly set downe by\nsome vpon set purpose to put vs out of the right way, and to discourage\nsuch as otherwise might bee desirous to search a passage by the way afore-\nsaid into those Seas.\n\nGerardus Mercator, a very industrious and excellent Geographer, was\nabused by a Map sent vnto him, of foure Huripi meeting about the North\nPole; which [49] now are found to be all turned into a maineicie Sea. One\ndemonstration of the crafty falshood of these vsuall Maps is this, that Cape\nMendocino is set in them West Northwest, distant from the South Cape of\nCalifornia, about seuenteene hundred Leagues, whereas Francis Gaule that\nwas imployed in those discoueries by the Viseroy of New Spaine; doth in\nHugo Linscotten his booke set downe their distance to bee onely fiue hundred\nLeagues.\n\nBesides this, in the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter in 57. de-\ngrees of latitude, the constant great tides euery twelue houres, and the in-\ncrease of those tides whensoeuer any strong westerne wind did blow, doe\nstrongly perswade vs that the maine Westerne Ocean is not farre from\nthence; which was much confirmed vnto them the Summer following;\nwhen sayling directly North from that place where they wintered, about\nthe Latitude of 60. degrees, they were crossed by a strong Currant running\nsometimes Eastward, sometimes Westward: So that if wee finde either\nHudsons Bay, or any Sea more neere vnto the West, wee may assure our\nselues that from thence wee may with great ease passe to any part of the\nFast Indies: And that as the world is very much beholding to that famous\nColumbus for that hee first discouered vnto vs the West Indies; and to the\nPortingall for the finding out the ordinary and as yet the best way that is\nknowne to the Hast Indies, by Cape Bona-Speranza.
