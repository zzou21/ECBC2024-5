    "15": "Preface\n\nThe records, and especially the Court Book, of the Virginia Company of London\nhave long been regarded as among the most precious manuscript treasures which\nhave found a lodgment within the United States. Not only is their inherent value\nas an historical source very great, as has been explained by the editor in her\nintroduction, but a sentimental value also attaches to them. This has a twofold\norigin. It arises, in the first place, from the fact that they belong at once to the\nromantic period of our own beginnings and to the heroic period of England's great\nstruggle against absolutism. The men who figure in the pages of this record were at\nthe same time playing their parts, on the one side or the other, in the controversies\nwhich were then beginning with James I, and which were to broaden and deepen\nunder his son till England was plunged into the agonies of the great civil war. They\nwere contemporaries, and in not a few cases associates, of Coke and Eliot and\nHampden, of Bacon and Wentworth and Buckingham. The names of Sandys and\nthe Ferrars stand high on the roll of patriots by which the first generation of the\nStuart period is distinguished. These same men also, together with a long list of\nthe merchants and nobles of the time, were deeply interested in discovery and\ncolonization. As successors of Gilbert and Raleigh they were planting a new\nEngland beyond the Atlantic. About this enterprise still clung some of the spirit\nand memories of the Elizabethan seamen and their early struggles with Spain.\nIn the days when Smythe and Sandys were active the prosaic age of English\ncolonization had not yet begun. The glamour of romance, of the heroic, attaches to\nthe founding of Virginia and Plymouth, and makes them fit subjects for the poet.\nBy the time when the other colonies were founded the glow and inspiration had\ngrown faint or wholly disappeared. In the Records of the Virginia Company some\nreflection may be seen of this early zeal, of the plans and ideals to which it gave rise.\n_ Even their pages, cast in a style which is quite unusual in records of this nature,\nmake one realize that he is in the company of noble and earnest spirits, men who\nwere conscious that they were engaged ina great enterprise. The Court Book itself,\nnow that it is printed in full, will be found to be a worthy monument of English\nspeech, as it was used at the close of the Elizabethan epoch and by contemporaries\nof Shakespeare and Bacon.\n\nThe tate which probably befell the original of this record, and the unusual steps\nwhich it became necessary to take in order to secure and preserve a copy, were nat-\nural consequences of the struggles of the time, and add still further to the interest of\n\n5\n",
    "16": "6 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nthe text as we now possess it. Miss Kingsbury, by her use of the Ferrar papers,\nhas Leen able to establish by the clearest proof the connection of Nicholas Ferrar\nwith the transcription, and in many other ways she has added detiniteness to the\naccounts usually given of the origin and preservation of the record as we now possess\nit. The transfer of the copy of the Court Book to Virginia and its transmission\nfrom hand to hand till, through the medium of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s library, it finally\npassed into the possession of Congress fittingly concludes the remarkable history of\nthe preservation of this manuscript.\n\nThe high estimate which has been placed on its value is evidenced not only by the\nuse that has been made of it by historians, but by the long-continued efforts which have\nbeen made to secure its publication. In 1858 Mr. J. Wingate Thornton, in an article\nin the \u2018\u2018 Historical Magazine,\u201d explained the nature of the Court Book, told how it\nhad been preserved, and insisted upon the importance of its being published. \u2018\u2018 As\nthese volumes are of national rather than of local interest,\u201d said he, \u2018\u2018 reaching back\nto the very foundation of the English companies for colonizing America; as they have\nescaped the chances and mishaps of two centuries, on either side of the Atlantic,\nand as Providence has now placed them in the keeping of our National Congress,\nis it not our national duty to have them appropriately edited and published?\u201d The\nfollowing year Mr. Thornton published a pamphlet in Boston, in which he outlined\nthe history of the manuscript and again raised the question of its publication. But\nsoon the Civil War came on, and plans of that kind, especially so far as they related\nto southern history, had to be postponed.\n\nBut in 1868, three years after the close of the war, Mr. Edward D. Neill pre-\nsented a memorial to Congress, in which he dwelt on the neglect by historians of\nthese most valuable manuscripts. He stated that, while preparing his book entitled\n\u201cTerra Mariae,\u201d he had familiarized himself with the chirography of the records.\nHe now offered to undertake their editing without compensation, if he might be fur-\nnished with two copyists for a limited time and be allowed a small sum for stationery\nand contingent expenses. But this offer met with no response, and Mr. Neill was\nforced to content himself with the publication of extracts from the manuscript in his\n\u2018History of the Virginia Company of London\u201d (Albany, 1869).\n\nIn March, 1877, Mr. Robert A. Brock, of the Virginia Historical Society, pub-\nlished in the ** Richmond Daily Dispatch\u201d a \u2018\u2018 Plea for the Publication of the Records\nof the Virginia Company.\u201d In 1881 Senator John W, Johnston, of Virginia, intro-\nduced into Congress a hill which was intended to provide for the publication of the\nrecords. This passed the Senate, but failed in the House.\n\nDuring three successive sessions between the years 1885 and 1888 Dr. J, Franklin\nJameson applied to the Library Committee of Congress for permission to edit and\npublish the records without expense to the Government. His plan was to obtain a\nsufficient number of subseribers to justify the issue of the volumes by a private firm\nand to meet the cost of the sale. Another suggestion which he also made was the\nappointment of a commission which should concern itself with the publishing of\n",

While occupied with this matter\nDr. Jameson explained the history and value of the records to the Rhode Island\nHistorical Society, and his address was reviewed in the \u2018\u2018 Magazine of American\nHistory\u201d (vol. 21, January-June, 1889, p. 82).\n\nBut meantime some progress had been made with the actual printing of the Court\nBook. Mr. Conway Robinson had made copious extracts from it, especially of the\ndocumentary material which is contained in the second volume. His extracts the\nVirginia Historical Society published in 1889, under the editorship of Mr. R. A. Brock.\nUntil the present time this edition, in two volumes, has served the purpose of most\nstudents. But the requirements of historical study in this country have now reached\na point where more complete and critical editions of the sources are needed than have\nbeen common in the past. If this need was to be met, it became at once apparent\nthat no body of records was better adapted for a beginning than those which related\nto the Virginia Company of London. In date and subject matter they stand at the\nvery threshold of American history. In character they form a distinct and unique\ngroup of material. By the issue of a definitive edition of these records the demand\nwhich scholars have so long made for their publication would be met and satistied.\nIt was under the influence of considerations like these that the present work was\nundertaken.\n\nIn the preparation of this body of records for the press critical accuracy and\nhelpfulness have been sought in all possible ways. The spelling of the original has\nbeen carefully preserved throughout, for in editing a source of this character and\nimportance any attempt to modernize the text would be properly regarded as unjusti-\nfiable. Not only has the spelling been preserved, but also the signs and abbrevia-\ntions which abound, the use of which the men of the period had inherited from still\nearlier times. So far as such a thing is possible in print, the text is exactly repro-\nduced in these volumes, while an added element of reality is supplied by the photo-\ngraphs of specimen pages of the original manuscript.\n\nBrief notes have been added where it was necessary to explain or call attention\nto obscurities, omissions, or other irregularities in the text, the purpose being to\nenable the reader to gain information of this kind from the printed page with the\nsame certainty as if he were using the manuscript. In the notes, cross references\nhave also been given to the documents of the company and to its publications, when\nthey have been found to reproduce, or to illustrate and make more detinite, the state-\nments which are contained in the Court Book. In citations of this kind the number\nof each document is given as it appears in the List of Records in the Introduction.\nIn this way the unity of the records of the company as a whole receives illustration,\nand the investigator will be aided in any effort which he may make to learn all which\nthey have to reveal in reference to any subject. Finally, the index completes the\ninvaluable service which Miss Kingsbury has rendered in the editorship of the work.\n\nHersert L. Oscoop\nCotumpia UNIVERSITY\n",

    "21": "1. The Chararter of the Company\n\nThe individual effort which had revealed itself at the close of the medieval\nperiod in other phases of the economic development and in the military history of\nthe past quarter century was especially prominent in the movement in 1606 fora\nsociety of adventurers to trade in Virginia. The commercial advance had been\ndue chiefly to private enterprise, and the naval expeditions into the West Indies\nagainst the Spanish had been fitted out and prosecuted by such adventurous spirits as\nSir Francis Drake, while the zeal for exploration and for gold, which inspired John\nand Sebastian Cabot to search for a passage to Cathay and the East Indies in 149%,\nled Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh a century later to seek out the\nresources of the lands from Florida to Newfoundland. It is the same spirit of\nadventure which inspired the narratives of Jobn Smith and Henry Spelman as\nthey told of their relations with the Indians of America. But it is in the progress\nof both the commercial and the political life of England that the Virginia Company\nis important. For the plantation founded and nourished by a private concern as an\nenterprise purely for gain was the social cause from which developed the colony\nasa form of government. Its political organization is seen in its relations to the\nCrown, of which there were two distinct phases. During the first three years it\nwas distinctly a creature of the King, the affairs of which were conducted hy the\nKing through a council created by himself and responsible to himself. while to the\ninvestors were left the privileges of raising the funds, furnishing the supplies. and\nsending out the expeditions. It was a modification of this form of management to\nwhich the government reverted after the dissolution of the Company in 1624, and\nagain at the end of the century when royal colonies were substituted for proprietary\nand corporate forms throughout America. In the second phase the undertakers\nbecame distinctly proprietary, retaining the commercial responsibilities, but assum-\ning governmental functions in place of the King.\n\nA comparison between the royal grants for discovery in the sixteenth century\nand those of the Virginia Company shows that there was an increase in the\ndirect territorial relations between King and subject, a limitation upon monopoly\n\nra\n",
    "22": "12 INTRODUCTION\n\nof trade, and a tendency on the part of the Crown to retain directly or indirectly\nthe powers of government. Thus, in the letters patent to Richard Warde, Thomas\nAshehnurst, and associates in 1501,\u00a2 to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, and to Sir\nWalter Raleigh in 1584,\u2019 the Crown conferred proprietorship of land with the\nright to grant it out in fee simple at will. But in 1606 the land was held by the\nundertakers, and again in 1609 by the adventurers and planters in free and common\nsocage, as of the manor of Greenwich of the county of Kent. Under the first Vir-\nginia charter it was granted by the King to those approved by the council; under\nthe second, by the members of the company to anyone who should have adventured\na certain sum of money or his person. The fief, distinctly so called in the early\ncharters, for which homage was to be rendered, with no service, however, save that\nof one-fifth of the gold and silver gained, had disappeared; and the only direct feudal\nrelation with the King which remained arose from the requirement of a per cent of the\nprecious metals. The monopoly of trade by which Warde, Gilbert, and Raleigh were\nallowed to seize and detain any one who trafticked within two hundred leagues of a set-\ntlement was altered in 1606 so that the planters had only the right of collecting a\ntax from such interlopers. The rights of government which had been surrendered\nabsolutely to the grantees in the sixteenth century charters were reserved to the\nKing by the letters patent of 1606 to be exercised through the council. In 1609\nthese powers were conferred on the company as an open body, it must be remem-\nbered, and thus differed from the earlier grants and from the later proprietary grants\nto Lord Baltimore or to William Penn.\n\nAlthough the charter emphasizes the government of the plantation, the Virginia\nCompany was purely a commercial enterprise conducted by a private concern, even\nbefore the charter of 1609, as is shown by the history of its early years. It was\nbacked by the patronage of the King, hut only for the purpose of advancing the trade\nof the Kingdom in foreign parts and saving the Crown from expense and responsi-\nbility, as had been the policy in regard to the other trading companies. Nevertheless,\nit was a step toward colonial expansion, for, as has well been said, \u2018\u2018 the explorer is\npotentially a colonizer,\u201d and the army of laborers on the plantation became in time\nan army of free tenants in a colony. While in the spirit of its commercial life the\ncompany was closely allied to the efforts for exploration and search for gold, morally\nsupported by Elizabeth in her feudal grants, in its organization, as well as in its pur-\npose, it resembled the private companies for trade based on ancient charters, and in its\ndevelopment is to be understood only through a knowledge of both of these earlier\nmovements.\n\n\u00abBiddle, Cabot, Appendix, pp. 312, 314, for this charter.\nbHakluyt, Principal Navigations, VIII, 17-23, 289-296.\n\u00a9 Osgood, H.

    "23": "CHARACTER OF THE COMPANY 13\n\nThus in order to protect trade, but not for exploration and settlement, the ancient\ncharters granted to the Merchant Adventurers in 1407 and 1462, and particularly the\none of 1564, incorporated that company into a \u2018* Body Politick.\u201d\u201d. The words of the\ngrant declared its purpose to be \u2018\u2018for the good Grovernment, Rule and Order of\nthe * * * Fellowship of Merchants Adventurers * * *. As also of all and\nevery other of the subject of our heirs * * * using the seate of Trade of the\nsaid Merchants Adventurers * * *.\u201d\u00a2 This was also the object expressed in\nthe charter to the East India Company,\u2019 although it contained an additional provi-\nsion for the acquisition of lands by purchase. Monopoly of trade and powers of\ngovernment over factors, masters, or others in the employ of the company were\nconferred, but the exemption from customs was to continue for only four years, and\nthe only settlements provided for were to have the form of factories. It had been\nestablished as a regulated company, that is, one in which each individual invested his\nown capital subject to the rules of the company; but in 1612 by increasing the\nimportance of the directors and investing sums for a limited period it became a\njoint stock company.\u00a2\n\nAs a prototype of the companies later incorporated both for discovery and\ntrade, such as the Virginia Company, the Muscovy or Russian Company, known as\nthe \u2018*\u2018 Merchant Adventurers of England for the discoveries of lands and territories\nunknown,\u201d was established in 1555 with a joint stock of \u00a36,000, Sebastian Cahot\nwas appointed governor for life and with him was associated a board of directors of\n4 consuls and 24 assistants. However, this company had also the rights of the compa-\nnies for exploration \u2014that is, those of conquest, of acquiring lands, and of seizing the\nships of any who should infringe on their monopoly of trade.\u201d In 1583 a conimittee\nfrom the Muscovy merchants drew up a set of resolutions concerning a conference\nwith M. Carlile upon his \u2018\u2018 intended discoverie and attempt into the hithermost parts\nof America,\u201d which was not dissimilar to the plan of Sir Walter Raleigh, and hence\nforeshadowed companies of the seventeenth century. It proposed to send forth\n100 men for one year, providing \u00a34,000 for the adventure, in order to gain a\n\u2018knowledge of the particular estate of the country and gather what commodity\n\n@Lingelbach, The Merchant Adventurers of England, 218-236 for extracts frem the charters.

The scheme differed from the sixteenth century\nenterprises, which were especially intended for exploration, in that no question of\ngovernment was considered, but it conformed to the ideas of Gilbert and Raleigh\nand of the trading companies, in that its rights over trade were to be purely\nmonopolistic.\n\nApparently this plan of the Muscovy Company stands as a connecting link\nbetween the ideas of the explorer and those of the trader and the planter, a plan which\nmay be said to have been carried out by the Virginia Company. It is significant that\nmany of the members of the Virginia Company were men who had taken part in the\nexpeditions of the late sixteenth century and had been interested in certain private\nvoyages of exploration carried on during the five years preceding the receipt of its\nfirst charter, while most of the leaders of this company were at the same time stock-\nholders and even officers in the Muscovy Company, the Company of Merchant\nAdventurers, the East India Company, and later of the Turkey, the Guinea, and\nthe African companies.\n\nIt is unnecessary to cite the charters of other companies or to search the history\nof the trading corporations of the sixteenth century in order to show that the Virginia\nCompany was similar in character. But, like the Muscovy Company and the East\nIndia Company, it was established to carry on trade in new and uninhabited lands,\nand hence had the additional features of a company whose purpose was exploration\nand plantation. The latter characteristic appears more especially in the charter, the\nformer in the instructions and correspondence of the entire period of its life. The\nobject of its first undertakers was doubtless to search for minerals and for a route to\nthe southwest, and to secure for trade the materials which were native and peculiar\nto those regions. The plantation was a necessity for this purpose, and incidentally,\nbecause of the character of the country, it was forced to become a colony. To estab-\nlish a settlement which should become a market for English goods, to advance the\nshipping, to spread the religion of the Kingdom were doubtless motives which\naroused sympathy for the undertaking; but the arguments which brought investment\nwere the opportunities for gain.\n\nThe position of the Virginia Company in the development of English exploration\nand trade was therefore important, and the study of its history is of value not only\nfor the light which it throws on Virginia itself but for an understanding of the\neconomic condition of England as well. Nor is this all. The few private records\nwhich remain of the Merchant Adventurers Company and those of the East India\n",

The fact that the private records, the books\nfrom which the knowledge of the actual financial transactions could be obtained,\nare missing in most cases, may prove that their loss in the case of the early Virginia\nCompany is not due to intentional destruction, but to the general opinion of the\nperiod that such material was valueless.\n\nThe only other enterprise of which there is sufficient material for anything like an\nexhaustive study is the East India Company, and hence its records combine with\nthose of the Virginia Company to supply a source of information concerning all of\nthese companies. The conclusion seems valid, therefore, that the great mass of min-\nutes, orders, instructions, letters, and memoranda of the company for Virginia will\naid in the interpretation of the comparatively few records of the earlier associations.\nThe records of this company are necessary to enable one to comprchend the life\nof the other companies, as is its history to the understanding of their development.\n\nIt was during the life of the company that the plantation gradually assumed the\naspects of a colony, that the settlement which was originally planned for exploration\nand the discovery of gold became a center for the development of the natural and\nagricultural resources of the surrounding country. The origin within the colony\nof the assembly, of local government, of private ownership of land, and of freedom\nof trade is to be found before the dissolution of the company by the Crown.

The growing correspondence between the Crown and\nthe company and the interference in the acts of the company stand as evidence of\nthe gradual increase of the interest of the Crown or its council in the undertaking.\nThis interest was most apparent when the tobacco trade promised a revenue to the\nCrown, but the encouragement of the growth of other staple products, the spasmodic\nrevival of acts touching English shipping and the balance of trade, and the main-\ntenance of staple ports in England are all new activities appearing in the records of\nthe company. Throughout, also, is apparent the readiness to allow the already\nuncertain economic policy to be altered or nullified by the political relations with\nSpain, or because of moral or whimsical views.\n\nThe gradual definition of policy on the part of the Stuarts, perhaps first apparent\nunder Charles I, is closely connected with the leaders of the Virginia Company.

The appointment of the commissions to\ninvestigate the affairs of the company and the condition of the colony, the creation\nof a commission for the control of the colony after the overthrow of the charter, the\nlater appointment of a committee of the Privy Council for the same purpose are all\nsteps in the growth of a colonial system and of a colonial policy. Although the\nmaturity of this system and policy is not reached until after the Commonwealth, the\ninfluence of the associates of James I and of Charles I is apparent.\n\nEvery phase of colonial development, from the mixed system which existed\nunder the patent of 1606 to the chartered proprietary company after 1609 and the\nroyal province after 1624, is here illustrated. The transition from the chartered\nto the Royal Government in 1624, the prelude to \u2018\u2018the most important transition in\nAmerican history previous to the colonial revolt,\u201d is only to be understood from\nthese records, since the tendency to self-government in the colony is one of the\npretended reasons for the overthrow of the company. All the steps of the change\nare to be traced in the royal correspondence, in the memoranda of the royal party,\nand in the record of the suit under the writ of quo warranto.

Examples of the private\ninterests are the enterprise of the Earl of Southampton in 1605 and that of Lord\nZouch as set forth in his contract? with Captain George Waymouth of October 30,\n1605. In this Lord Zouch agreed to secure and provide two ships and 200 men of\n\u201carts suitable for a colony,\u201d and to pay \u00a3100 to Captain Waymouth for the trans-\nportation of the same. The interesting feature is the agreement, suggestive of\nfeudal relations, that Lord Zouch should be the first officer and have the first choice\nof land, while Captain Waymouth as second officer should have second choice of\nland, which he was to hold from the former as lord paramount for himself, his\nheirs and assigns. At the same time Sir John Popham was busily engaged in the\nattempt to form royal colonies by obtaining charters from the Crown, whereby the\nterritory from 34\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude should be taken under the protection of\nthe King, and private settlements should thus be excluded.\n\nThe plan which obtained followed neither course, though it was bound to result\nin a modification of Popham\u2019s scheme. The motives of the grantees and the\narguments which induced the King in 1606 to abandon the policy of Elizabeth and to\ngive royal patronage to the undertaking, and even to assume royal control, are set\nforth in a petition presented to Parliament in 1606, entitled \u2018\u2018 Reasons for raising a\npublique stocke to be imploied in the discovering of such countries as may be found\nmost convenient * * * .\u201d\u00b0 It is evident, however, that the unknown plan of\ninvestment in the adventure of 1606 is not here suggested, since there was no intima-\ntion of financial support by the King.

The desirability of a revival of the declining export trade, as well as that\nof establishing the importation of necessities from a part of the dominions, though\ndistant, was urged, together with the importance of strengthening by settlement\nthose countries already acquired by discovery. That such undertakings by private\nenterprise had been failures; that it was more honorable for the State to back an\nexploitation by public consent than by private monopoly; that public colonies were\nbound to be more obedient and industrious because of the greater confidence in the\ncharacter of the control, were all reasons which had long before been set forth\nwhereby to gain the support of the Crown.\n\nCHARTER OF 1606.\n\nThe royal aid as finally obtained for a colonial enterprise came in a somewhat\ndifferent form. The letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates and others for plantations\nto be made in Virginia\u00ae show that the investment was made solely by individuals,\nand that the joint stock was not public, although in the regulation of affairs in\nthe colony the body of undertakers was to have little influence, even as far as its\ncommercial interests in the plantation were concerned. The business management\nwas left to the joint stock companies, and the magazine was controlled by a treasurer\nor cape merchant and by two clerks elected by the President and Council in the\nColony. In fact, the only activity of the adventurers, so far as it is revealed in\nthe extant documents, consisted in the choice in London of one or more groups of\nagents, called \u2018\u2018 companies,\u201d to manage the goods sent out and received and to\nlook after the profits.

Of these the most\nimportant are the reports of Captain Newport, and the relations of John Smith, of\nEdward Maria Wingtield, and of George Percy.* The council had dispatched three\nexpeditions, all under Captain Newport; one in December, 1606, in three ships\nwith 120 emigrants; another in October, 1607, with two vessels and about the same\nnumber of passengers; and a third in August of 1608 with about 70 emigrants.\n\nThe reports of Newport, Percy, Wingfield, and Smith encouraged the managers\nof the enterprise to continue their efforts, but proved that a change in object as well\nas in policy would be necessary. From Newport came descriptions of the fruitful-\nness of the soil, of the quantities of fish and of timber, and of clay for making brick,\nand enumerations of the possible exports, comprising sturgeon, clapboard, wainscot,\nsaxafrage, tobacco, dyes, furs, pitch, resin, turpentine, oils, wines, wood and soap\nashes, iron, copper, pearls; but the reports as to the mines were vague. He\ndeclared that the country was rich in gold and copper, and took home with him earth\nto be assayed, while Smith, in A 7rue Relation, states that he had been left to dig a\nrock which Captain Newport thought was a mine, but no mention of results is made.\n\nThe full description of the country by Newport and also by Captain John Smith\ngave the council a clear idea of its geography, as is indicated by the instructions to\nSir Thomas Gates in 1609. But the expedition, which penetrated to a distance of 160)\nmiles up the river, brought the explorers to hostile tribes and left the council still\nuncertain, though hopeful of the discovery of a passage to the south sea. Further-\nmore, Captain Newport positively stated that there could be no commerce with the\nIndians, and all evidence shows that the natives were to be a resource for the neces-\nsities of life rather than for the exchange of lucrative objects of trade.

Then, too, the regulation of the affairs of the colony without any control\nfrom the council in England meant continued jealousies and quarrels among such a\nsmall number of colonists and under such unsettled conditions. According to\nWingfield the provisions for defense seem to have been insufficient, the magazine\nwas mismanaged, and the relations with the Indians were strained.

This book, covering\nthe period from the 28th of January, 1606, to the 14th of February, 1615, was in\nthe possession of the company as late as 1623, but unfortunately no trace of the\nbook has yet been discovered and even its existence has heretofore been unknown.\n\nWhatever may have been the source of control, the narrations of Captain\nPercy, Edward-Maria Wingtield, and Captain Newport indicate that the business of\nthe company consisted chiefly in raising funds and equipping expeditions to be sent\nto Virginia under Captain Newport. This failure of the investment to bring in\nreturns of gold and silver and of articles for trade, or to accomplish anything in\nthe way of discovery of trade routes to the East Indies during the first three years,\nserved to convince both King and undertakers that a change in method of control\nwas essential. The document known as \u2018\u2018 Reasons against publishing the Kings\ntitle to Virginia. A justification for planting Virginia\u201d? seems to show an agitation\namong the investors arising from fear lest the desire to placate Spain, or religious\nconsiderations, might lead the Crown to abandon the scheme. The arguments there\nadduced may well explain the readiness of the King to surrender not only the com-\nmercial and territorial control but also full rights of government to the corporate\nbody of the Virginia company, and thus to avoid any rupture with Spain. Certain\nit is that the desire for more direct authority and for securing larger investments\nwere the motives of the petitioners in asking for a new charter.\n\nAsa result of this movement the letters patent of 1609 were issued, transform-\ning the undertakers into a body politic. In this case also the documents are\nespecially characteristic of the organization. Whereas the Crown was formerly the\nsource of all power, beginning with 1609 the council of the company, acting as a\nstanding committee for the adventurers rather than in the name of the King,\nexercised the controlling authority. After the charter of 1612 had provided for\nmore frequent meetings of the generality, the council was gradually superseded by\nspecial committees and the tendency arose to decide all matters of importance in\nthe general quarter courts and to insist upon all communications being addressed\nto the company rather than to the council. The act of incorporation erected a\ncommercial company and made it the overlord of a proprietary province. It at\nonce strengthened its plantation as a center for traffic and established a system tor\njoint management of land and trade to extend over a period of seven years, prom-\n\n\u00abWhen the Privy Council demanded the records of the company, a receipt bearing the date April\n21, 1623, was given to the secretary of the company for the \u2018\u2018several court books.\u2019\u2019 This document\nwas discovered by the Editor among the Ferrar papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, in December,\n\n1903.

In\n1613, under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe, the adventurers were com-\npelled to appeal to the Crown because of the complications with France which arose\nfrom the expedition of Sir Samuel Argall along the northern coasts of America,\u2018\nwhile a similar relation was brought about by the controversy with Spain with regard\nto the attack on Spanish vessels by the ship Zreasurer in 1619.4 In both instances\nthe protection desired was granted. When the financial stringency forced the adven-\nturers to great efforts in 1614, and they appealed unsuccessfully to Parliament for\naid, the Privy Council attempted to arouse confidence in the undertaking throughout\nthe country.

But\nmuch of this information is lacking in the completeness and authenticity which\nwould have been supplied by the court book and the other records. The greatest\nloss is perhaps that of definite knowledge concerning the financial status of the\ncompany. The sums adventured by individuals and corporations is preserved in\ntwo alphabetical lists; but, so far as is known, only one of these lists is official, and\nthat includes the names of the particular adventure about the year 1610.\u00b0 The other\nis an unpublished list apparently both incomplete and unofficial, and was probably\nmade somewhat later than 1618 at the order of the court,\u2019 although the date 1618\nhas been assigned to it in the Manchester papers, where it is to be found? From\nthe records of the various London companies and from records of English towns,\nas also from adventures sealed to individuals by the Virginia Company, comes the\nmost authentic information concerning the large sums invested during this decade.\nIn a similar way the knowledge, otherwise to be found in the court book and \u2018\u2018The\npticulers of the Boates,\u201d concerning the ships dispatched and the sums expended for\nthe equipment of planters, individuals, and companies, is scattering and indefinite.\nThe broadsides issued are calls for adventurers, planters, and colonists, with the\nrequirements or statements concerning the lottery schemes; but they do not furnish\nthe wide information which is found in those of the later period.

Judging\nfrom the sources of information in the later period, this uncertainty is due to the\ndisappearance of the letters themselves, since, after 1619, the published relations of\nindividual planters, the declarations by the company, and even the records of the\ncourt books are all more general in character than the letters which were sent from\nthe colony to the company. Furthermore, in the later period the daily acts of the\ncolonists and their needs, as reported from time to time by returning ships, afforded\nthe adventurers a body of information concerning the social condition of the colony\nwhich in form and accuracy left little to be desired. After the time of Captain John\nSmith not much was accurately known of the colony until the year 1617, when\nCaptain John Rolfe and Ralph Hamor supplied statistics as to the numbers, condi-\ntion, settlements, and resources of the colony as it then was.\n\nThe individual enterprises of this decade in the life of the company are\naltogether unknown, except from a few contracts for shipping found here and\nthere.

It also included an interesting\nreference to Raleigh\u2019s colonists.

Here was the\ngerm which was to develop into the colony, but the plan was as yet by no means\nso far-reaching.

In order to increase the\ncapital stock, the company made personal appeals and issued printed statements and\ndescriptions which it scattered broadly. The story is told in the lists of adventurers\ncited above, in the earnest endeavors to secure new planters and new adventures from\nindividual town and guild, in the efforts to enforce the payment of sums already\nadventured, in a few receipts concerning tobacco, in the lottery schemes, which were\nlegalized by the charter of 1612, and in printed broadsides and declarations. Thus the\nsums adventured by individuals, by the various London companies, and by the towns\nof England are given in a series of requests for adventure and in bills of adventure\u201d\nissued by the company and found in the records of those companies and towns? as\nalso in private collections. The chancery proceedings, in three suits, state that the\ncompany attempted to secure an adventure of \u00a318,000 and the equipment of 600\nmen during the year 1611, and the failure to accomplish its purpose was set forth by\nthe defendants as a reason for refusing to pay the sums adventured. Incidentally\nthere was mentioned an income in the year 1613 of \u00a38,000 from the lottery, of\n\u00a32,000 from the sale of the Somers Islands, and of \u00a3600 or \u00a3800 from the disposal\nof the ship De La Warr. However, with the exception of an unpublished letter\nfrom Sandys to the mayor of Sandwich\u201d concerning the adventure by that town, in\nwhich he inclosed a list of the subscribers to that particular adventure, with the sums\nset down by each,\u2019 the official records reveal but little as to the sums which must\nhave been received by the company.\n\nIn a similar manner there are unauthentic records of economic value concerning\nthe lotteries and the importation of tobacco.

It also holds out the promise of improved conditions\nunder Gates and De La Warr, who are to be shortly sent to Virginia with a complete\noutfit of men and provisions. The second document describes the southern part of\nthe country and cites the advantages of Florida as evidence of the opportunities\nin Virginia. After the time of De La Warr the published accounts of the plans,\nmovements, and successes of the colonists became more complete. While the state-\nments of De La Warr in his Relation are a bare outline of the conditions as he\nfound them and the improvements in trade and discovery to which Captain Argall\nhad contributed, together with his lordship\u2019s plans for the future, it is of value\nas forming, with Hamor\u2019s narrative four years later, a surprisingly accurate and\nsatisfactory treatment of the development in the colony during those years.\n\nHamor givesa clear statement of the methods and success of Captain Dale in his\nrelations with the Indians, of his organization and reform of the colony, and of his\nestablishment of order therein, and reveals clearly the state of affairs on the arrival\nof Gates, the cause of the failure heretofore, and the details of the building of the\nsuccessive towns, with descriptions and statistics for each.

Then, too,\nthe first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610-1612,\nmartial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the\ncompany now proposed;* the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a\nminimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and\nthe produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early\nsettlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall,\nlike Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the\nIndians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted\nin the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south,\nwhich became self-supporting and independent of the \u2018\u2018supplies\u201d from England.\nThis meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward\nthe colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be\nabandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family\nhad been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had\nbeen sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent.\n\nWhether the company made any resistance to this development within the set-\ntlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter,\nwill only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain\nthat by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They\nhad then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of\nthe produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the\nmonopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619,\nwhen the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most\neagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys,\nby this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House\ncommittee which reported against monopolies.\n\nTo such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir\nGeorge Yeardley in November, 1618, called \u2018\u2018The Great Charter of privileges, orders,\nand Lawes,\u201d recognized the necessity for loeal government. They provided for two\nhouses, the \u2018\u2018Council of State,\u201d to be chosen by the company in its quarter court,\nand the general assembly, to consist \u2018\u2018of the Council of State and two Burgesses\n\n\u00abFor the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall, &c., entered for publica-\ntion on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by\n\nthe lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611.\nThey are reprinted in Force, Tracts, Vol. III.\n",

Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular senti-\nment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of adminis-\ntration or whether it was due to the influence of the \u2018\u2018opposition\u201d in parliament can\nnot be settled without fuller records than are at present extant.\n\nIV.\u2014-LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY\n\nThe printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company\nwere of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor\nand council of Virginia tothe Virginia Company. There were also letters from indi-\nviduals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England.\nThey may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the\ninfluences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt\nto conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the\nstory of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival\nof Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve con-\nditions.\u00a9 Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge\nrespecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of\nJamestown,\u201d especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers.\nDale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men,\nand suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making\nthe settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received\nreassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the\npublications of the company and the letters trom the colony from 1615 to 1618 were\n\n@List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.\n\n>There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power\nby Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to\nCaptain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 161s,\nThey are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622.

These were the years of the\nexcessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall.\u00a2\n\nThe only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of \u2018\u2018 A Register\nbook during the Goim! of Sam\u2019 Argall Esq\u2019 admiral, and for y\u00b0 time p\u2122sent, prin.\ncipal Gou\" of Virg*\u201d in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 17380\nunder the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia\nat that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of\ncorrespondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and\nbetween the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of\nprivilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is signiticant because of the long con-\ntest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent.\nThere are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and\nseveral warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to\nthose issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods\nof government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been\nchanged by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of\nreduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the\nperiod.\u2019\n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS\n\nWhile the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence\nreceived from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the\ninformation which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe,\u00b0 addressed to\nLord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph\nHamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and\ngovernment and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location,\nthe number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other\nletters extant, similar in character, though of less value.?\n\nBut another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of\ndocuments of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating\n\n@\u00a5For the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown,\nGenesis, I, 428-439, 488-488, 488-494, 501-508; II, 639-640: Virginia Magazine of History, 1V, 28, 29;\nX, 134-138.

Only one series of documents relating to\nindividual adventures is extant, those by which Lord Zouch\u2019s investment in Virginia\nwas secured to him. His contracts were made in May, 1618, with John Bargrave\nand James Brett. There is also his warrant to John Fenner to pass to Virginia and\ntrade with the colony and the savages in his pinnace Silver Falcon, in February,\n1618/19.\u00a2\n\nThe other series of documents, which illustrate the legal forms and methods of\nthe company, as also the way in which the first plantations were undertaken by\nprivate means, concern Smythe\u2019s Hundred and Berkeley Hundred.

Of\nthe documents of this character, which are given by Brown, perhaps the correspond-\nence between the Spanish ambassador in London and the King of Spain is the most\nvaluable, not in the trustworthiness of the data\u2014though much of it confirms other\nsources\u2014but in the revelation it contains of the part that Spanish relations played\nin the development of the company and especially in its decline during the follow-\ning decade, while its reference to prevalent rumors, reports, and sentiment are\nextremely illuminating.

Ohe Collections of Documents, 1616-1524\n\nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE REcoRDS\n\nThe character of the documents of the company after 1619 is fundamentally\nthe same as in the preceding decade. Virginia was still a proprietary province\nwith a commercial company as an overlord, and therefore the company was still\nthe immediate source of all government in the colony. To it came all appeals\nfrom colonial authorities; it exercised control over all commerce, both from and\nto Virginia; it granted all land and all privileges. Although the number of doc-\numents emanating from the Crown \u201c\u2014that is, of the first class\u2014is large, they are\nrather an indication of the increasing wealth and importance of the company, than\nof royal interference. They concern the regulation of trade, complain of the\nabuse of power by the company, or provide for the investigation of its acts\nrather than assume any authority in the direct administration of its affairs. In\nthem interference in the management is foreshadowed, but it is not until the\ndissolution of the company that the Crown again becomes the proprietor.\n\nThe mass of materials which form the records for this period is much\ngreater than in the earlier decade. This is due on the one hand to their\npreservation in two or three collections, and on the other especially to the vast\ngrowth of business in the company and the rapid development from a colony\nfor exploitation into a colony for settlement. Thus the minutes of the company,\nforming the second class of documents, show that it conducted a larger amount\nof business than any other proprietary company.? These minutes comprise two\nlarge volumes of the court book, and fill 741 manuscript pages.\u00a9 In the third\nclass there are nine letters from the company to the governor and council in the\ncolony, and twelve from the latter body to the company, in addition to a large\nnumber of receipts, commissions, instructions, and laws.\u00a2 A mass of material\nbelonging distinctly to the plantation serves as a part of the records of the\n\n@See documents under Class I in the List of Records.\n\n>For this statement, as also for a full understanding of the character of the company, see Osgood,\nThe American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century, I, 61.\n\n\u00a2Grouped under Class II in the List of Records.\n@ Tbid., Class III.\n",

This group consists of the \u2018\u2018court booke\u201d of the\ncouncil of the colony during the last year of the authority of the company,\ncovering about 65 pages; 54 commissions, orders, proclamations, and warrants to\nsubordinates in the colony issued by the governor and council in Virginia, and\n35 petitions to the same body from the members of the colony.\u00a2 The publica-\ntions of the company for this final period of its existence number 3 large\nbroadsides, 11 declarations containing 168 printed pages, and 4 sermons and\ntreatises made up of 150 pages.? The supplementary official material found in\nthe correspondence between individuals of the company and of the colony or\nbetween members of the company in England, in addition to the records of the\nprivate companies within the larger body, includes many documents and memo-\nranda.\u00b0 Sixty-six of these are preserved in the Manchester papers, while 78 are\nfrom the Ferrar papers, which are now first made known and published. The\nunofficial material, consisting of records of other companies, of towns, and of\ncorrespondence touching on the affairs of the company or colony, numbers about\n40 documents.?\n\nThe relative value of the various classes of the records for this period has\nbeen altered by the preservation of the court book which has made the other\nmaterial supplementary, or even subsidiary, with the exception of the correspond-\nence; for in it is either recorded or summarized the information which the\ncompany had received from all other sources, or which it imparted to individuals\nor to the public by other means. But the fact that the other records are\nsupplementary does not decrease their value, for they often furnish the data\nwhich are the basis of the acts and conclusions of the company, while some of\nthem also reveal the legal or political processes of the company, of the colony,\nof the courts, or of the sovereign authority, and others are of great value in the\nlight which they throw on the dissenting party within the company.\n\nThe subject-matter of the court book, as well as the character and contents\nof the various documents, proves the changed condition which the increase of\nbusiness had brought about, since a large proportion of the records deal with the\nfounding and conducting of private enterprises, and many of them are really\ndocuments of a private nature.

    "267": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 41\n\nhad become the development of the resources of Virginia instead of the produc-\ntion of wealth through mines and the opening of new trade routes. As a result\nof this change in commercial object had come the need of larger, more numerous,\nand more scattered settlements in the colony, and of greater co-operation on the\npart of the settlers, although it may well be claimed that the latter necessity had\nbeen urged upon the leaders by the mismanagement of Captain Argall during\nthe three years previous to the change in administration. In order to increase\nthe number of planters, concessions of privilege had been made to private parties\nor groups as early as 1618, since such investments were doubtless easier to secure\nwhen the adventure was under the immediate control of the undertaker. Simi-\nlarly, for the purpose of stimulating capital and gaining the co-operation of the\nplanters, the division of land, promised in 1609, was proclaimed in 1616. Free\ntenancy was now guaranteed to all individuals, even to indented servants, at the\nexpiration of seven years. The organization of joint stock companies for the manage-\nment of trade, which supplanted the magazine, was a movement toward private enter-\nprize. Hence it is that these subjects, together with those which concern the impor-\ntation and sale of tobacco, occupy the greater part of the court book, and must have\nconsumed most of the attention of the corporation. The burden of discussion in the\ncourts concerned the best means of marketing the products, whereas in the earlier\ndecade it must have related to the increase of capital. The records of the colony\nwere no longer simple reports to the company and instructions from the proprietor,\nbut assumed the character of political documents, since liberty of land and trade, and\nthe creation of numerous plantations and scattered settlements resulted in the growth\nof \u2018\u2018 political conditions and forces side by side with the commercial and economic.\u201d\nThe minutes of the colonial legislative assembly, the records of the colonial court, the\npetitions to the governor and council, and the commissions and orders granted by that\nbody are all distinctively new features in the records.

The Miscellaneous Papers, 1606-1683, are a\nseventeenth century transcript. The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records,\n1606-1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R.\nHickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification\nof these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the com-\npany, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as\nthe [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion,\narising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of\nVirginia, William Stith and John D. Burk, and by the editor of many of the\ndocuments in 1809, William Hening.\n\nThe following statements with regard to the first group made by Mr. Jefferson\nin a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1825,% will serve as a basis for the attempt\nto ascertain the history and authenticity of those manuscripts:\n\n\u2018** The only manuscripts I now possess relating to the antiquities of our country\nare some folio volumes: Two of these are the proceeding[s] of the Virginia company\nin England; the remaining four are of the Records of the Council of Virginia, from\n1622 to 1700. The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to\nStiths History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company,\ncopied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of South-\nampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor\nByrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These yolumes\nhappened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland,\u2019 whose\nlibrary I purchased, and with this they were sent tome. I gave notice of it to Mr.\nZane, but he never reclaimed them.\n\n\u2018* The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the\ncouncil. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin\nthe History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from\nthe council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he\nhad made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably\nunobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his\nexecutor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes were sent to me asa\npart of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being\nhandled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily\nopened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years.\u201d\n\n@From the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825. >Col.

    "270": "44 INTRODUCTION\n\nCONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the \u2018\u2018 proceedings of the\nVirginia Company in England\u201d are the contemporary copies of the court book\nwhich were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the\nestate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or\nlater. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have\nbeen when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he\nmade a visit to England, that he made the purchase. That the books remained\nin the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by\nthe fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the\nthird William Byrd, who died in 1777,? but these two volumes were not in the\nlibrary of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac\nZane. Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may\nbe accepted,\u2019 but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when\nhe states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been\nreturned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that\nColonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contempo-\nrary copies of the court book in his History of Virginia is apparent from his\ndescription of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated\nto him by the \u2018\u2018late worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq.\u201d\n\nMANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III\n\nThe other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from\nMr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue,\nbelong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr.\nJefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of\nthe Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to\nMr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of\nVirginia, he describes in a similar way.\u00a2\n\n@ William Byrd died December 4, 1704.

Bassett.\n\n\u00a2 For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion,\npp. 78-84, post.\n\n@It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been\nacquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton\nRandolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by\nJustin Winsor.

    "271": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOOUMENTS, 1616-1634 45\n\nThat these are the papers discussed by Stith is proved by comparing them with\nthe Hickman (Bland) transcripts. In his preface, Stith confirms the description\nby Mr. Jefferson, but he apparently destroys the latter's theory that the papers\nhad been in the possession of Peyton Randolph since the death of Sir Jobn Randolph\nin 1736. Mr. Stith wrote his preface in 1746, and suggests that they were at that\ntime in the possession of the House of Burgesses, although he does not make a\npositive statement to that effect. His assertions are worth recording, since they\ncarry the history of the volumes back thirty years and also throw light on the\nHickman transcripts.\n\n\u201c\u2018T must chiefly depend upon such of our Records, as are still extant. Many of\nthem doubtless perished in the State-house at James-Town, and by other Accidents:\nand those, which have survived the Flames and Injuries of Time, have been so care-\nlesly kept, are so broken, interrupted, and deficient, have been so mangled hy Moths\nand Worms, and lie in such a confused and jumbled State (at least the most ancient\nof them) being huddled together in single Leaves and Sheets in Books out of the\nBinding, that I foresee, it will cost me infinite Pains and Labour, to reduce anid\ndigest them in any tolerable Order, so as to form from them a just and connected\nNarration. And some of them have been lost, even since Mr. Hickman was Clerk of\nthe Secretary\u2019s Office. For I cannot find, among the Papers in our Offices, some old\nRolls, to which he refers. I have therefore been obliged, in a few Points, to depend\nupon the Fidelity of that Gentleman\u2019s Extracts out of our oldest Records, made for\nthe Use of Sir John Randolph. But these things were so far from discouraging and\nrebuffiing me, that they were rather an additional Spur to my Industry. For |\nthought it highly necessary, before they were entirely lost and destroyed, to apply\nthem to their proper Use, the forming a good History. But as the House of\nBurgesses in a late Session, upon my shewing their moldering and dangerous State\nto some of the Members, have justly taken them into their Consideration, and have\nordered them to be reviewed and fairly transcribed, I doubt not, by their Assistance,\nand with the Help of the late Sir John Randolph\u2019s Papers, and such others, as are in\nthe Hands of private Gentlemen in the Country, and will undoubtedly be readily\ncommunicated to further so noble and so useful a Design, to be able to collect and\ncompose a tolerably regular and complete History of our Country.\"7\n\nHence, we are again left ina quandary. The papers may have come into Pevton\nRandolph\u2019s possession through the arrangement made by the burgesses for their\ntranscription; but no transcript made directly from the documents as late as 1745\nis known to us. Whether they were borrowed from the province by Mr. Stith or\nby Peyton Randolph, his brother-in-law, or hy some other historian or antiquarian\nis not yet proved; and our only evidence that Jefferson secured them from Peyton\nRandolphb\u2019s executor is his statement made twenty years after the date of the purchase.\n\n\u201cStith, History of Virginia, preface, p. vill.\n",

The order of contents of the volumes (while\nnot chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the\ndirection of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by\nthe early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts\nare original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them,\nby the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of\nthe period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province\nHouse was burned in Bacon\u2019s rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch\nin 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter\nhalf of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled\n\u2018\u2018Letters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625,\u201d is evidently the one\nreferred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as \u2018\u2018the other side of No.\nA 42.\u201d\u00a2 This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692,\ncalled by Hening the \u2018Bland copy.\u201d In pages 1 to 14a of this volume are eighteen\nletters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while\npages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and\nAugust 6, 1623.

That this is the original blotter of the court book of the gover-\nnor and council in Virginia, containing the original record of suits tried before that\nbody and of orders issued by it, is proved by the hasty and brief entries, giving the\nvolume an entirely different character from those of the carefully elaborated tran-\nscripts of the clerks.

In this case also they would have been made from Mr.\nByrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton\nRandolph library, but this would not account for the name \u2018*Cawson\u201d in the\nsecond volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of\nRoanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even\non friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since\nTheodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son\nof Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theo-\ndorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the\nproperty of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke.\n\nThe location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph\nof Roancke is known.

These,\nhe continues, were used by John Burk, who got them from John Randolph, and\nalso by Skelton Jones, 1809, to complete Burk\u2019s History of Virginia.\u201c Mr. Burk\nhimself declares that there are two large volumes, instead of three, as stated by\nHening, \u2018\u2018containing the minutes of the London Company together with the pro-\nceedings of the Virginia Councils and Assembly, with little interruption to the\nmiddle of the reign of George II.\u201d?\n\nJEFFERSON TRANSCRIPTS\n\nThe three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia Records which came\nfrom the Jefferson Library in 1815 are unique, containing copies of records since\ndestroyed.

Burk some of the printed laws of Virginia in his possession,\nsince they were unique and could not be replaced.\u2019 The internal evidence points to\nthe fact that Hening also used the other volumes of this set, a fact corroborated\nby the following statement of Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Mr. George Watterson,\nMay 7, 1815: \u2018\u201c\u2018I gave to Mr. Milligan a note of those folio volumes of the Laws of\nVirginia belonging to the Library which being in known hands, will be recovered.\nOne is a MS. volume from which a printed copy is now preparing for publica-\ntion.\u201d\u00b0 Mr. Hening was doubtless using them in the preparation of his later\nvolumes. Certain it is that these documents form the basis for a part of his first\nvolume, in which he cites the Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626-1634, as\nbelonging to Thomas Jefferson, and as having been \u2018purchased by him with the\nlibrary of Peyton Randolph, from his executors.\u201d The third, the Afscellaneous\nRecords, 1606-1692, he states was bought by Mr. Jefferson \u2018from the executor of\nRichard Bland, dec\u2019d.\u201d\u00a2\n\nThe seventeenth century volume, entitled Jnstructions, Comm\u00e9tons letters of\nAdwice and admonitions and Publique Speectes, Proclamations dc: Collected,\ntranscribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging\nto the Assemblie, is a vellum-covered book, with an embossed figure on the back\ncover, and with the following: \u2018\u2018E/ 1621/ Publiqg, Letters / and Orders.\u201d On the\noutside of the front cover upside down is: \u2018\u201c\u2018E/ John Bland | Richard Blan [d] !\nAlexander Morrison,\u201d / while on the half that remains of the first fly leaf is the\nname \u2018\u2018Nelson.\u201d On the fly leaf in the book in pencil is the statement: \u2018\u2018date of\nMSS 1650-1695;\u201d and on the front cover similarly is: \u2018*17\u201d Century copie Bland.\u201d\nThis presence of Richard Bland\u2019s name in the book shows that Mr. Jefferson secured\nit with the Bland Library. The writing of the volume is similar to the early seven-\nteenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double /, and the\nformation of some of the letters.

It thus possesses\nreproductions of all of the Virginia material in the British Museum, the Privy Council\noffice, the Bodleian Library, and the Magdalene College Library, Cambridge. In the\nPublic Record Office all docquet notices on Virginia, all records of suits in chancery\nand the admiralty pertaining to Virginia, and the gwo warranto in the King\u2019s Bench,\nby which the company was dissolved, as well as the most important documents and\ncorrespondence, have been transcribed or photographed for the Library of Congress,\nbut the correspondence of the planters, the less important correspondence of the\ncompany, and mere memoranda are yet to be transcribed. The latter material is\nfairly outlined in the Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574 to 1660, and in\nthe Appendix of the eighth report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts,\nor is printed elsewhere in full.\u201d\n\nThe collection of publications by the company belonging to the Library of\nCongress is fairly good. It contains twelve of those which were issued before 1616,\nbut of the later books it has only three. The Declaration of 1620, the Declaration\nby Waterhouse in 1622, and John Donne\u2019s Sermon of the same year, in addition to\nSmith\u2019s General History, are the only ones of the eighteen now extant which are in\nthe Library.\n\nDOCUMENTS IN RICHMOND\n\nThe colonial records in Richmond, Virginia, relating to the period of the\ncompany are extremely few in number. Fortunately the original documents,\nwhich are in the Library of Congress, were borrowed or abstracted from the\nstate house in time to save them from destruction during the Revolution or by\nfire in 1865.\u00b0. There are, however, two volumes of original records in the Virginia\nState land office containing grants of land in 1623 and 1624, which were evidently\nentered by William Claybourne, at that time surveyor for the colony. The his-\ntory of contemporary documents before 1625, which are located in the district\nof the old settlement, may thus be briefly told.\n\nThe valuable collections of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond\nembrace the John Randolph of Roanoke transcripts described above, while the\nState library has three sets of transcripts and one set of abstracts from the British\nPublic Record Office.

In the Lenox branch\nof the New York Library is to be found a unique set of documents relating to the\nsettlement of Berkeley Hundred in 1619, known as the Smyth of Nibley papers\nwhich \u2018\u2018are from the collection of Virginia manuscripts originally brought together\nby John Smyth (or Smith) of Nibley, the historian of the Berkeleys, who was born\nin 1567 and died in 1641. The collection comprises over sixty papers, original and\ncontemporary transcripts, relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and\n1634. After passing into the hands of John Smyth the younger, and more recently\ninto the Cholmondeley collection at Condover Hall, Shropshire, the manuscripts\nwere offered for sale in January, 1888, by Mr. Bernard Quaritch, from whom\nthey were lately bought and given to the New York Public Library by Mr. Alex-\nander Maitland.\u201d* With the exception of the manuscripts in the Ferrar collection\nrelating to Smythe\u2019s Hundred, these form the only extant records of the important\nmovement for private plantations in Virginia under the r\u00e9gime of the company.\nTwo other valuable documents are now in the possession of the Lenox Library,\u2019 the\nholographic letter of John Pory, secretary of the colony, dated September 30, 1619,\nand Commissioner John Harvey\u2019s declaration of the State of Virginia in 1624.\n\nCOLLECTIONS OF AMERICANA\n\nThe manuscripts in the Library of Congress, the Smyth of Nibley papers in the\nNew York Public Library, and the patent books in Virginia are the only original\nrecords of the company or of the colony previous to 1625 now in America.

    "282": "56 INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the\nonly documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a\ndivision of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by\nthe Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an\nimperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declara-\ntion in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary\npamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has hereto-\nfore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch\nof supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of\nJune 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John\nBrinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox\nLibrary. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled Virginia's God\nbe Thanked,\u2019 with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the\nPequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there\nare copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition\nto these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing\n**The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\u201d and Observations to be followed for\nmaking of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \u2018\u2018 A valuation of the commodi-\nties growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\u201d are to be found in\nthe Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox\nlibraries. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by\nJohn Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Karl of Southampton,\nnow to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries.\n\nThe New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter\nBrown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains\ntwo unique publications of the company, the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620,\nwhich is the only copy known to the Editor. A catalogue of Bernard Quaritch, in\n\n\u00abThe other copy is in a private collection in New York.

A copy was in the\nCholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May,\n1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition\nthat it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem\nvalid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page\nin that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.\n",

It refers to the Virginia Company in its address\nonly, and in the statement of the number of poor that had been sent to Virginia,\nbut is of value for an understanding of that movement. The other private\ncollection is of about the same size. It contains the duplicate of the 1620\ndeclaration in the Lenox and the only known copy of \u00ab four-page tract entitled\n\u2018Declaration how the monies were disposed (being) collections for the Grammar\nSchooles,\u201d by Patrick Copland.\u00b0\n\nIn the catalogue of Bernard Quaritch for May, 1887, the broadside of May 17, 1620, and the\nNote of the Shipping, 1621, are both noted as being unique since each contains the final clause: \u2018\u2018 Who-\nsoever transports himself or any other at his own charge unto Virginia, shall for each person go trans-\nported before mid-summer, 1625, have to him and his heirs forever 50 acres of land upon a first\nand 50 acres upon a second division.\u201d\u201d A copy of the Note of the Shipping, 1621, in the Cholmondeley\ncollection is similarly described in the fifth report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, page\n341. The Quaritch copies were sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch, whose collection went to Mr. Lefferts, and\nfinally through the dealers, Geo. H. Richmond or Dodd, Mead & Co., either to a private collection or\nto the Lenox Library. But the Lenox copies either do not correspond to these descriptions or were\nnot purchased from Mr. Lefferts. The volumes of the Lefferts collection, which were not sold in\nAmerica, were sent to Sotheby, England, but Mr. Eames of the New York Public Library states that\nno early Virginia material was allowed to return to England.\n\n+The collection of Americana belonging to Mr. Ayer is open to the public through the\nNewberry Library.

Aspinwall, a merchant, secured among other papers the Chalmers\ncollection of letters and documents relating to Virginia from 1606 to 1775. They\nwere in turn sold to Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, a lawyer and notable\ncollector of New York City, from whom a part were purchased by the library,\nwhile others came to the Lenox with the Bancroft transcripts in 1898. Chalmers\nhad been a clerk in the State paper office and seems to have taken these\nextracts, outlines, and sometimes full copies from the Plantation office papers,\nsince be continually refers to them in his Polit\u00e9cul Annals.\u00a2 They are modern-\nized transcripts, failing to follow the early orthography, abbreviations, and\ncapitalization. The writing is cramped and often almost illegible, while the\ntable of contents is incomplete and useless. They comprise (1) a series of brief\noutlines of Privy Council orders; (2) extracts from the Dudley-Carleton papers:\n(3) outlines of additional Council orders; (4) a calendar of certain of the colonial\nState papers; (5) outlines of council orders dealing with other trading companies.\nAll of the original documents are at present in the Public Record Office and are\nnoted in the Bibliographical List of Records following.\n\nThe Bancroft papers relating to Virginia and the Simancas Archives are well\nbound, clear, and apparently careful, correct, and full copies of the documents\nincluded. The first two volumes of the Bancroft collection bearing on the Virginia\nCompany are transcripts of many of the documents in the State paper office,\nprobably made in 1852 by Noel Sainsbury, but the list is not complete. While\nthe peculiar and characteristic signs of abbreviation are not followed, the orthog-\nraphy seems to be accurate throughout. Furthermore, the collection includes\nthe document entire, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents is carfeul\nand correct.\u201d The \u2018\u201c\u2018Simancas Archives\u201d is a volume of transcripts of \u2018\u2018 Papers\nin the Simaneas Archives relating to the History of Virginia and other portions\n\n\u00abSee a statement by Victor H. Paltsits, April 14, 1896, inserted in the first volume of these\npapers now in the Lenox.\n\nb The documents transcribed in both the Chalmers-Barlow and the Bancroft volumes are noted\nin the List of Records under \u2018\u2018 Remarks.\u201d\n",

As the property of\nNicholas and John Ferrar, who were second only to Sir Edwin Sandys in their\nactivity in the company, it would be invaluable; but its importance is further\nenhanced by the fact that it contains the correspondence and papers of Sir Edwin\nSandys himself. These seventy-eight papers, which are either records of the\ncompany or vitally concern it, cover the period of the Sandys-Southampton influence\nfrom 1617 to the summer of 1623. They were the property of Dr. Peckard,\nmaster of Magdalene College in 1790, and were bequeathed to the college upon his\ndeath. It is probable that the greater part of the collection came from the Ferrar\nfamily through Dr. Peckard\u2019s wife, Martha Ferrar, the great granddaugher of\nJohn Ferrar, since the Virginia papers form but one-third of the group. The remain-\ning papers concern family affairs only, and date from 1601 to the middle of the\neighteenth century. Some of them are doubtless those received from the Earl of\nDorset by Dr. Peckard, when he was preparing his Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar.\u201d\n\nThe first knowledge of the Ferrar papers in later years was communicated to\nthe Virginia Magazine of History by Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Little Gidding, Ealing,\nEngland.

There are some envelopes without letters, many\nrough memoranda by both Nicholas and John Ferrar, some account books, and some\nrough drafts of petitions to the House of Commons and of discussions on the\nsilkworm. The autographs which they furnish of both Nicholas and John Ferrar\nhave been of no little interest, as well as value, for the identification of other papers\nin the Public Record Office, and in the Library of Congress. Furthermore, the\nproof that Nicholas Ferrar himself supervised the transcript of the court book is\nthus gained,\n\nIn this collection are twenty-three papers which are veritable records of the\ncompany.\u201d Two documents give our only knowledge of the financial affairs of\nSmythe\u2019s Hundred, slight indeed, but from them comes additional information\nconcerning the system of organization of the societies for private adventure. Sundry\nother unique though scattered documents are among these papers, such as receipts\nfor money expended, showing the method of business, reports of committees, and of\nproceedings of the commissioners, revealing the bitterness of the factions, drafts or\noriginal records of certain courts, forming the only proof of the accuracy of the\ncopies of the court books, and three new proceedings of the courts of the Somers\nIslands Company. One of the latter is evidently a blotter and reveals the methods\nused in keeping the court book. The guo warranto in English, which was served\nupon the treasurer and company, would have been of the greatest value had not the\noriginal record of the suit in the King\u2019s Bench just been discovered. Another\ndocument of great value is the receipt referred to above, which proves that a court\nbook was regularly kept by the company from its very beginning. It reveals how\nmuch has been lost.\n\nThe series, consisting of twenty letters from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar,\nshows more clearly than any other documents we possess\u2019 who the real managers of\nthe affairs were and what was the spirit of the Sandys faction. The absolute confidence\nwhich Sir Edwin Sandys had in John Ferrar and his great love for both of the brothers\nis significant. Moreover, the knowledge of the affairs of the company, the careful\nwatch over every act and movement affecting the business, the deep and earnest\nplans for the advancement of its interests revealed in these letters prove that Sir\nEdwin Sandys was the keen financial manager of the undertaking. It was evidently\nhe who determined what the policy should be; he was apparently the statesman\n\n@ List of Records, Nos. 76, 138, 164, 258, 259, 303, 304, 394, 421, 423, 470, 479, 539, 541, 543, and\nthe guo warranto.\n\n\u00bb For these letters see [bid., Nos. 120, 131, 135, 136, 171, 181, 191, 197, 211, 219, 271, 275, 282, 307,\n315, 316, 317, 364, 368.\n",

These letters are as full of\ncomplaint with regard to the insufficient supplies sent with new planters, as are the\nletters in the Manchester papers which Sir Nathaniel Rich and the Earl of Warwick\nused as a basis of accusation against the management of the company, but they\ndiffer from the other complaints in that they are kindly in spirit. Mr. Pory\u2019s letters\nare full of definite information concerning the affairs, needs, and hopes of the\ncolony, while Governor Yeardley also gives some valuable statements with regard to\nnew settlers, the council, the relations with the Indians, and the government of the\ncolony; both complain of the scant provisioning of the new settlers, The burden of\nthe Yeardley letters, however, is the investigation of the affairs of Captain Argall\nand the consequent criticism drawn upon himself from Lord Rich. Unfortunately,\ncomparatively few additional data are afforded concerning the Argall affair either by\nPory or by Yeardley. The planters themselves tell much of their condition and of\nthe districts in which they have settled, but the theme of their letters is most likely\nto be a demand for promised payments or a complaint as to the scarcity of provisions\nand clothes. The attitude toward Yeardley is generally favorable, John Rolfe alone\nsupporting Argall and criticizing the governor. As from all correspondence of\nsuch a character, new ideas are gained, new points of view, and often additional\nknowledge of relations with the Indians and with one another. Many of these\nletters are annotated by John Ferrar, revealing the degree of importance which he\nattached to their various and often conflicting statements.\n\nPUBLIC RECORD OFFICE\u2014MANCHESTER PAPERS\n\nA class of documents, very similar in character but of quite different spirit, is\nthe Manchester papers, now in the Public Record Office, London.

    "288": "62 INTRODUCTION\n\nSir Nathaniel was a leader in the Warwick faction, while Earl Robert, after the\ndissolution of the company in 1624, became a member of the council for Virginia.\nThe third wife of the Earl was Eleanor, Countess of Sussex, daughter of Richard\nWortley, and she, after the death of the Earl of Warwick, married, as her fourth\nhusband, Edward Montague, second Earl of Manchester. Thus it is that the\nKimbolton manuscripts, which are the records of the Duke of Manchester, contain\na large collection of petitions, declarations, memoranda, letters, and lists which\nemanated from the Warwick faction of the Virginia Company.* Many of these are\nholographs of Nathaniel Rich and Alderman Johnson, prime movers in that conflict.\nHenry Montague, Viscount Mandeville and later Karl of Manchester, was at one\ntime lord president of the Privy Council. Therefore many of the Manchester papers\nmay have belonged to him. The autographs, however, identify those which concern\nthe Virginia Company as having belonged to Nathaniel Rich.\n\nThe Manchester and the Ferrar papers therefore present the two sides of this\nconflict, not in open court or even in private contest, but in the private documents\nand memoranda of the leaders. The collections are of about the same size, there\nbeing sixty-six papers in the Manchester series, to seventy-eight in the Ferrar group.\nThese, also, are unbound, but since the greater part are rough notes of documents,\nor drafts of propositions or speeches, they are much more difficult to decipher than\nthe Ferrar papers. Indeed many of them are almost illegible, and not a few are\nunintelligible, having no connecting thought.\n\nA dozen of these papers may be considered documentary; that is, rough copies\nof letters, petitions, and declarations, or of acts of the company, or of its members\nand officers in an official capacity. A few of these only are to be found among the\nother records of the company. Like the rest of the set, they, almost without\nexception, concern the accusations against the Sandys-Southampton management.\nThree of them are petitions or letters concerning the extent of the tobacco trade,\nbut the rest are petitions to the King against one faction or the other, and answers\nto those petitions. Of these, one of the most important is a copy of the opinion\nof counsel concerning the powers conferred on the Virginia Company by the\nseveral letters patent.? Accusation and defense are set forth in these documents,\nbut the headings of speeches, the drafts of propositions, and the notes from docu-\nments on which the arguments are based proclaim the motives and methods of the\naccusers. No proof could be clearer than these memoranda by Alderman Johnson\nand Nathaniel Rich that the company was to be overthrown by fair means or foul.\nIn two or three papers are carefully prepared lists of alleged evil deeds of Sir\n\n\u00abThese Manchester papers are calendared by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts,\n\nReport VIII, Part 2.\nb List of Records, p. 140, No. 170.\n",

Thus, various books kept by the company during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s\ntime, and not otherwise known, are mentioned.\u201c Five or six rough drafts of\npropositions concerning the tobacco and salary question are also to be found\nhere, as well as numerous statements of sums adventured, of the number of men\nsent to the colony, lists of members favorable to one faction or the other and\ncandidates for office from both parties. Many of the rough notes of both Johnson\nand Rich furnish the only source of information concerning the directions given\nto the commissioners appointed by the Crown to investigate the condition of the\ncompany and of the colony and their acts and reports, but a fact of greater sig-\nnificance is this, that the Warwick collection contains a dozen rough drafts of\ndirections to those commissioners, of charges against the company to be sent to\nthat body, of preliminary reports concerning the government of Virginia, and of\nprojects for the settlement of the government and the colony. The source of the\nschism is here revealed, and the accusation by Sandys that accuser and judge were\none is justified.\u2019\nCOLONIAL AND DOMESTIC STATE PAPERS\n\nThe other large group of Virginia records, consisting of over one hundred\nand twenty separate documents, ix found among the colonial and domestic papers\ndeposited in the Publie Record Office. The source of this collection is uncertain.\nMuch of it came from the Plantation Office, and perhaps from the Privy Council\nOffice. The consolidation of depositories took place in 1578, but the efforts of\nDr. Thomas Wilson, the first clerk of the papers, to force the previous and\nincumbent magistrates to hand over all documents to the State, were evidently\noften unavailing, and hence it was that the creation of a State Paper Ottice was\nnot really accomplished until the period of the company. After Sir Thomas\nWilson succeeded his uncle during the reign of James I the aid of the King was\nmuch relied upon, and, though partially successful, the recent revelation of quasi-\npublic documents in private collections shows that not only earlier but later\nofficials considered papers of record private property.

Similarly, the Cottonian papers in the Museum\noriginally belonged to Sir Robert Cotton in the time of James I.\n\nAmong the State Papers deposited in the Record Office are the letters to\nJohn Ferrar, dated from Virginia in April, 1623, which may have been seized by\nthe commission appointed on May 9, 1623, to investigate the affairs of the com-\npany. There, too, are found the attested copies of letters and records in the\ncolony which concern the Harvey Commission, sent to the commission in England\nby Edward Sharpless. A few of these papers seem to have belonged to the\ncompany, such as the documents pertaining to the Walloons and dated 1621;\nPory\u2019s report from Virginia, in the same year; and two copies of documents by\nCollingwood, dated the latter part of 1623.7 All of these facts lead to the con-\nclusion that a part of the records of the commissions, and a part of the confis-\ncated records of the company are here deposited. If so, where are the remainder\nof these most valuable documents? ?\n\nThe colonial papers and the domestic correspondence include about forty-eight\nwhich are records, and about nineteen which are documentary in character.\nThe first group contains, among other papers, many of the petitions and letters\naddressed to the King and to the Privy Council, and many others of the council. It\nis thus apparent that the royal correspondence of the Privy Council and the Privy\nCouncil papers which should accompany the register are in this collection. To the\nsecond group belong those papers which contain projects presented by individuals and\nanswers to such propositions, lists of adventures for the company, and also lists\nof men sent to the colony and of lands granted in Virginia. Among these papers\nare seven letters from colonists, in addition to about fifty which may be consid-\nered subsidiary correspondence in that they refer incidentally to the affairs of\nthe company. Such are the Mandeville-Conway, Middlesex-Conway, Chamberlain-\nCarleton, Conway-Calvert, and Nethersole-Carleton letters.\n\nRECORDS OF COURTS\n\nIn the libels of the admiralty court, instance and prize, are found records of\nsuits in which the Virginia Company is plaintiff.

In the latter are valuable\nreferences to Argall, and the complaints against Wye, though torn and illegible,\nreveal something of the loss estimated as resulting from the failure to settle the\npassengers in Virginia.

In the colonial entry\nbooks and among the proclamations of the King are orders of the Privy Council\nand of the King, all of which are recorded in the Privy Council register.\n\nPRIVY COUNCIL REGISTER\n\nSince the Privy Council took no direct part in the affairs of the company\nbetween 1617 and the summer of 1622, its orders related to those regulations which\nwould enable the acts of the company to advance the interests of the kingdom, leaving\nabsolute power to the company as the proprietor. Thus fully one-half of its thirty\nmeasures during those five years were reprieves of prisoners, with the warrants nec-\nessary to send them to Virginia or orders enabling children to be transferred from\nthe cities of the kingdom to the colony. During this period the Crown commenced\nits attempts to secure a revenue from the tobacco trade, and a series of orders finally\nresulted in the approval of the contract with the company in February of 1622 3.\nIn its foreign and external relations the company was of course subject to the action\nof the Privy Council, and hence the orders in council concerned the contest with\nSpain over the attack of the 7reasurer. Furthermore, the disagreement with the\nnorthern colony concerning fishing privileges had to be adjusted by the council and\nresulted in the renewal of the patent to the northern colony and in regulations as\nto rights of fishing. It was in the summer of 1622 that the first movement was\nmade which brought the difficulties between the factions into the open board.\nThe petition of John Bargrave against Sir Thomas Smythe, Alderman Johnson,\nand others, in which they were accused of mismanagement, resulted in the defeat of\nBargrave six months later, as was to have been expected from the hostility of the\nCrown to the party in Parliament led by Sir Edwin Sandys, of which Bargrave\nwas evidently a member at that time. But the storm broke in the following April,\nwhen the commission was appointed to inquire into the true state of the Virginia\nand Somers Islands companies. From that date until the dissolution of the com-\npany in the summer of 1624 the council busied itself with the affairs of the company.\nNo less than 31 orders are recorded which create commissions and empower them\nto investigate both the colony and the company and in the end to assume the\nfunctions of government in the name of the Crown, while seven of these documents\npass directly between the council and the colony, and no other measures were con-\nsidered except those which enabled the Warwick faction to tear down the work of\nthe adventurers and to take into its own hands the control of the entire business.\nThese forms of government, planned by the Crown and the commissions here\nrecorded, by which the authority was vested in the commissioners and later in a\ncommittee of the Privy Council, stand for the beginning of royal control.

These registers contain the orders of the council, and, after\nCharles I, also the petitions received and the letters issued by the council. In\nthe earlier reigns such documents were not recorded; whether they were even\npreserved as public documents is not certain, although, as stated above, many of\nthem have found their way to the Record Office and are there calendared among\nthe colonial, domestic, or foreign papers.

Not only is the writing similar to much\nof that in the contemporary transcripts of the court book, but they are unsigned\ncopies, and the headings of a number of them seem to be in the autograph of Edward\nCollingwood.

Four of them are of value not only for the form\nbut for the knowledge they furnish of the distinction made between the four classes\nof adventurers: those who paid money into the treasury and agreed to plant one\nhundred persons, those who established a private plantation, those who were private\nplanters, and those whose \u2018\u2018shares exceedinge 50 acf are exempted from payinge\nany Rent to y\u00ae Company for the persons they transporte.\u201d In addition certain\nknowledge is afforded concerning the grants.

Che Records of the Company under the\nSandys-Southampton Administration\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY\n\nIn order to comprehend what the records of the company were and what their\nvalue, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the system which the corporation\nworked out in order to further its purposes. The forms and usages of the company\nafter 1619 were determined by the charters granted by the King and by the \u2018* Orders\nand Constitutions\u201d which it adopted in 1619 and printed in June, 1620,\u00a2 although the\nlatter were altered or newly interpreted from time to time by action of its courts.\n\nThe membership of the company was unlimited and was granted by the courts\nto anyone who had \u2018\u201c\u2018adventured\u201d \u00a312 10s. for a share of stock or to whom the com-\npany had awarded a share of stock for services.\u2019 The distinction between a member\nwho was free of the company and an owner of Jand in Virginia was brought out in a\ncontroversy on February 19, 1622 3, in which a proposition to limit the adventurers\nto those approved by the generality met with opposition on the ground that land in\nVirginia was held in free and common socage and could not be forbidden to any man.\nBut Sir John Brooke, the legal authority in the company, declared that such exclusion\nwas agreeable to the law since it was a question of a vote ina court and nota ques-\ntion of ownership of land. The argument was based on the power to withhold the\nprivilege of voting from Samuel Wroth, who was under censure, and similarly on\nthe power to exclude any man who had purchased Jand from a member who was\nindebted to the company until the debts were paid. This discussion also revealed\nthat no oath of fidelity was required in the Virginia Company as in the Muscovy\nand other corporations. Ata later date the King proposed that no member should\nbe free of the courts who had not sent men to the colony as planters, claiming that\nless than thirty of the adventurers could meet the requirement.\u2018 The power to dis-\nfranchise an unworthy member was reserved to the company.\n\naList of Records, No 183.\noMS.

On the Monday preceding they assembled in a prepar-\native court and on every Wednesday fortnight thereafter in a common or ordinary\ncourt, as required by the charter of 1612; and they might also be summoned to\nan extraordinary court by the treasurer or deputy. The meetings were held in the\nprivate houses of various members of the company\u201c until the time of the tobacco\ncontract, when a company house was established.\n\nIn the quarter court the adventurers elected all councilors and principal officers\nof the company and colony, made all laws and ordinances, confirmed all grants of\nland, settled all questions of trade, and passed all measures which should bind the\ncompany for a termof years. Their action with regard to questions of a new charter\nand of investment for the colony was legal only when transacted in a quarter court,\nbut they might transfer to other courts actions which concerned correspondence\nwith the lord treasurer or similar business. Fifteen of the generality and five\nof the council formed a quorum for the ordinary courts, and in those they signed\nwarrants, ordered the payment of bills passed by the auditors, and sealed bills of\nadventure. In that meeting also were perfected commissions for transportation\nof men and provisions and for trade and barter. Special officers and committees\nwere appointed in this court, and even actions of great importance, such as the\ndissolution of the magazine or the extension of freedom of the company to hon-\norary members, were consummated.\u2019\n\nThe officers chosen by the company were a council, a treasurer, a deputy,\nauditors, a general committee of sixteen, a secretary, a bookkeeper, a husband, and\na beadle. The adventurers looked to the treasurer or governor not only as the\npresident and moderator, but as the manager of their business interests, and expected\nhim to be responsible for the policy of the company in its relations with the govern-\nment and to formulate and present plans for the development of the plantation and\nthe profit of the adventurers. To him was entrusted the supervision of the treasury\nand the collection of moneys.\n\nThe care of the court books was given to the deputy. It was his duty to attend\nto the engrossing of the orders and resolutions of the courts, the registration of\nletters to and from the company, and the formulation of statements to be given to\nthe public. He also kept the court of the committees and supervised the issue of\nwarrants.\n\nThe council was a body, gradually increasing in size, elected for life, and was\nsworn by the lord chancellor or by the lord chamberlain.

Although the chief officials and committees received no salary, at the expira-\ntion of the year\u2019s term of office it was customary to award 20 acres of land in\nVirginia to each individual, with the provision that such land should not be sold.\nThe company similarly rewarded individuals who had rendered great service, but\nsometimes it granted shares of stock instead, or agreed to transport for the indi-\nvidual a certain number of men free of charge.

Imme-\ndiately upon assuming his duties us treasurer, Sir Edwin Sandys instituted an\ninvestigation of the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe. In this connection four\nbooks and four rolls were prepared containing the subseriptions, which had been\nmade for carrying on the business, and a list of the adventurers with the sums\ninvested during the previous years. The treasurer made a similar request of\nthe deputy, John Ferrar, on September 18, 1620, in which he asked that the\nsecretary and Mr. Carter should make three catalogues of the adventurers\nindebted to the company in order that they might be given to a solicitor for\ncollection.

The first contained\nan account of the money disbursed for provisions, the second, a catalogue of the\nprovisions sent to the colony, and the third, a list of the names of the persons\ndispatched to the plantation with the trade of each. Because of the erection of\nprivate plantations in later years it was necessary that these records should be\nsupplemented. Hence an order of court provided that the names of all persons\ntransported to Virginia should be reported to the company and that a bookkeeper\nshould be appointed to be at the house of the court to register the names before\nthe departure of every ship. This record was to consist of the name, age, country,\nprofession, and kindred of each individual and was to state at whose charge the\ntransportation was effected. Contrary to custom each person was required to pay\na fee for registration. A duplicate of the register was to be sent to the Governor\nof Virginia, but the names of those departing were not to be made public until\nafter the ship had sailed.\u00a2\n\nProvision was made in 1620 for keeping duplicates of all patents issued.\nA part of this series is now deposited in the British Museum, from which the\nvarious kinds of patents and the terms for each may be discovered.?

According to\nDr. Peckard, Nicholas Ferrar, knowing that malice was at work, procured a\nclerk to copy out all the court books and other writings and caused them to be\ncarefully collated with the original. It cost him the sum of \u00a350, which he thought\nwas the best service he could render the company. After the seizure of all the\nmuniments of the company, and after Lord Treasurer Middlesex had procured\nsentence against the company, Mr. Ferrar informed Sir Edward Sandys and others\nof what he had done. These men were greatly rejoiced and advised that the copies\nbe taken to the Earl of Southampton, who was so overcome that he is said to have\nembraced Mr. Ferrar and to have declared that he valued them as an evidence of his\nhonor more than as evidences of his land. John Ferrar is quoted as having stated\nthat the Earl of Southampton was advised not to keep these records in his house\nand so delivered them to Sir Robert Killigrew, who left them on his death to Sir\nEdward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset. Mr. Ferrar continues that the Earl of Dor-\nset died in 165%, but he hopes the records are still in the possession of the Earl\u2019s\nfamily. ?\n\nCertain it is that Dr. Peckard had a large collection of manuscripts which\nconcerned the Virginia Company, some of which must be considered a part of the\nrecords of the company, for such were the Ferrar papers described above which\nDr. Peckard bequeathed to Magdalene College, Cambridge. That some of them, at\nleast, came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family is to be concluded from the statement\nof Dr. Peckard that the \u2018*\u2018 Duke had had his library searched and found a few loose\npapers, which he sent to him.\u201d* Some of them doubtless belonged to Dr. Peckard\u2019s\n\n\u00abThis pamphlet is in the volume entitled: Copy of a Petition from The Governor and Company of the\nSommer Islands, with Annexed Papers, presented to the Right Honorable The Councel of State July the 19th,\n1651.

But the story of the purchase of the two volumes from the\nestate of the Duke of Southampton by Colonel William Byrd in 1673 or 1688 for\n60 guineas has firm credence through statements of Mr. Byrd himself; and there\nis no evidence that they came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family. That they were\nsent to Tichfield by the Earl of Southampton before he sailed for the Netherlands\nand there remained until his son\u2019s library was sold after his death in 1667 seems\nprobable. Perhaps some of the other records went to Sir Robert Killigrew, as\nstated by John Ferrar, and even some from which these copies were made.\n\nThe statement by Woodnoth, who was a nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, that Sir\nJohn Danvers had the transcripts of the records made in order to keep out of\nthe way an indigent man who had been employed by the company as a copyist\nand who might be persuaded to say something ill of Sandys and of Nouthampton.\ndoes not bear the stamp of truth or even of probability.

The old labels were\npasted on the new backs and bear the title in gold letters on red leather: Record of\nthe Virgin: / Compan:\u2019, while gold letters on black leather indicate the volume:\nVol. / I. / and Vol. / II. /. In the first volume manila strips are pasted from the\ninner cover to the first and to the last fly leaf in order to strengthen the binding.\nThe paper is of the seventeenth century type, hand-made and uneven in texture. In\nthe first volume there are three hundred and fifty-four pages, with five fly leaves in\nthe front and seven in the back, while the second contains three hundred and\neighty-seven pages preceded by three fly leaves and followed by four, with two\nextra manila pages in both the front and back.

The rest\nof the insertion is usually by his assistant, who was perhaps Thomas Collett, his\nnephew. All of the insertions in the first volume and about twenty in the second\nare entirely in the so-called Collett autograph, numbering about the same as those\nsuperintended by the deputy himself. The way in which these insertions are often\ncrowded in, is evidence that they were copied from the original documents in spaces\nleft for the purpose by the hired copyist.\u00b0\n\nAs to the identity of the other three or four distinct autographs, in which\nthe remaining part of the volumes appear, nothing has been determined. The\nfirst and third copyists are distinctly different in style, while what appears as\nthe writing of a fourth and a sixth clerk may possibly be identical with that of\nthe first. With the exception of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar, the whole is\nclearly, carefully, and legibly written in the characteristic running hand of the\nperiod, resembling the chancery hand. The spelling, capitalization, and abbrevia-\ntions are distinctive and characteristic of each copyist. The use of curved lines\nto complete blank spaces at the end of the line, and often at the bottom and top of\nthe page, shows the labor expended to make the transcript accurate and complete.\nThe memoranda at the end of the volumes declare that the transcript had been\ncarefully collated with the original \u2018\u2018courte booke\u201d and with the authentic docu-\nments by the secretaries, Edward Waterhouse and Edward Collingwood, in the\nfirst volume, and by Thomas Collett and Edward Collingwood in the second.

The records\nof four courts were there discovered, which are almost identical with those of the\nsame date in the Library of Congress volumes.\u2018 The only ditterences, and these\nare not numerous, are those which would naturally result from the fallibility of the\ncopyist, and the apparent custom of the time to ignore the orthography of the\noriginal. One is led to believe that these loose pages of courts form a part of the\nbook from which the copy was made. This is shown by the use of larger letters to\nemphasize certain words, and by Edward Collingwood\u2019s corrections of the Library\nof Congress copy to make it conform to these drafts. Even the omission of one or\ntwo lines in the Ferrar copy, later corrected, can be accounted for by reference to\nthese sheets, since in each case it has resulted from the same word occurring in the\nsame place on two successive lines. Furthermore, the directions in the margin of\nthese courts as to where certain documents were to be entered were followed in the\ntranscript and seem to point to these as a part of the original minutes. The\nautograph of the court held on June 25 is identical with that of the first copyist\nof the transcript, while the courts of July 4and July 9 were apparently written by\nthe sixth copyist of the transcript. Among the Ferrar papers are two drafts of a\nresolution concerning the \u2018\u2018 Lo T\u00e9er speach touching M\u2019 Alderm. Johnson,\u201d which\nwas entered in the court book.

Thus they seem rather to have been drafts\nof a resolution which had been presented than of one prepared to be offered.\nComparison between these records of courts and a draft of a Somers Islands court,\nin the same collection, leads to the conclusion that they do not forma part of the\nblotter or blurred book from which the original hook was made, since the latter\nare much corrected and altered and then canceled diagonally from corner to corner;?\nbut are rather a part of the original book itself. The reliability of the Library of\nCongress transcripts is also confirmed by collating them with the original documents,\nor with other copies of the documents, which are inserted in the court book, and these\ncareful comparisons have shown how accurately Edward Collingwood and _ his\nassistants conducted the work for Nicholas Ferrar.?\n\nTHE SYSTEM OF KEEPING THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe system by which the minutes of the courts were kept is thus outlined in\nthe minutes; the court book was first drawn up by the secretary, was approved by\nthe deputy, and later accepted or corrected by the court.\u00b0 That there must have\nexisted a \u2018\u2018Blurr booke\u201d in addition to the various reports or other documents\noffered in any court is proved by an extract from a memorandum by Sir Nathaniel\nRich, which is a warrant requiring all records of the court to be brought to the\ncommissioners on Virginia, and includes the \u2018\u2018Court Bookes w should warrant\nthe sd Record*, and the Blurr bookes w should warrant the Court Booke and\nis the first ground of the Record*; that it may [be] discouered whether there be\nany difference betweene them.\u201d\u201d The entries in the court book are the minutes\nof all the various courts, of several meetings of the Somers Islands Company,\nand of one meeting of the committees.\n\nIntroducing each court is a list of the adventurers in attendance. A comparison\nof the number with the number of votes cast as recorded shows that these are\nquite complete for the quarter courts, but in the ordinary courts either the\nattendance was very small or the entry was incomplete, since the list is often\nterminated with the expression \u2018\u2018and divers others.\u201d It was sometimes entered\nlater than the transcript of the body of the text, as though from a book of\nattendance, but no mention of a roll book is found among the records.

The approval of the\nprevious court is usually recorded first, although many times this is deferred until\nthe quarter court; then follows the report of the treasurer, through which the\nimportant matters to be determined are presented to the court, and the hearing of\npetitions, passing of shares, and grants of land appear at the end of the session.\n\nIn the ordinary courts were propounded all of those matters which did not\nrequire action in the general court and often many measures for preliminary dis-\ncussion which were postponed for final action to the fuller court. Thus the records\nof the common courts and also of the preparative courts usually contain the full\nreports and discussions of the various subjects, while the statements in the quarter\ncourts are brief and perfunctory, embodying the decisions reached in the lesser\ncourts. The reports of officers, from which so much concerning the financial status\nis to be learned, are entered in the minutes of the general court. To trace the course\nof any question necessitates a search through all of the courts, but in the quarter\ncourts will be found the elections and the final action on all laws and ordinances, on\nthe patents for private plantations or monopolies, or, in short, on all measures by\nwhich the company would be bound for a term of years.\n\nCONTENTS OF THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe business recorded during the first two years of the Sandys administration\nconcerned the establishment of laws and orders in the company and in the colony,\nthe systematizing of methods, the formation of joint stock companies for the erection\nof new industries in Virginia, and the opening up of new adventures. But after the\nmassacre early in the year 1622, the whole tone of the book changes. Personal feuds\nand quarrels, complaints, and accusations fill the pages. Whether the friction was\ndue to the extreme distress brought about by the attack of the Indians or whether it\nwas but the excuse for open opposition by the party of the Crown, which had been\nrapidly developing, is difficult to determine. From the spring of 1622 until\nFebruary, 1622/3, the burden of the record concerns the tohecco contract with the\nCrown. It resulted in the discussion of salaries for the officers and the quarrel\nwith Samuel Wroth, which occupied the attention of the company for three mouths.\nThen followed the Butler and Johnson accusations, the investigation by the Crown,\nand the dissolution of the company. It is literally true that, after June, 1622, no\nnew measures for trade, for industry, or for commerce are entered in the court book.\nThere was the usual transferring of shares and hearing of petitions and claims, but\nthe business activity was evidently destroyed.

Even a partial financial account could\nbe rendered, though not an itemized statement. The larger sums invested or\nreceived from the various sources are usually given in the treasurer\u2019s plans and the\nofficers\u2019 reports, although unfortunately only those of the treasurer and deputy are\nentered in full. But from scattered statements in plans, reports, and discussions,\nfrom grants, patents, suits, letters, petitions, and claims will come much that will\nilluminate the financial situation when these are gathered together.\n\nThe full record of all documents for which record was not provided elsewhere\nwas made in the court book. Plans, reports of committees, and reports of chief\nofficers seem to have been entered in full, but letters to and from the colony, and to\nand from the privy council, petitions with the action thereupon, charter parties,\ngrants for monopolies, lists of departing planters, expenditures and receipts of the\nmagazines, and rolls of adventure, were all recorded in the other books provided by\nthe \u2018* Orders and Constitutions\u201d or in the books created later. A single illustration\nwill suffice. Of the twenty-seven letters sent to the colony and received from the\ncolony, copies of many of which have been found among the papers in Virginia, but\nfifteen are mentioned in the court book, and only a few are spread in full upon the\nminutes. A great many more documents are entered in the court book during the\nlater years, due evidently to the desire to keep a record of the controversy which\nmight serve as a defense against the accusations of the malcontents. That many of\nthese were not entered in the original court book is revealed by the marginal notes\nin the extant court minutes of the Ferrar papers, which read as follows: \u2018\u2018 Enter the\nquietus est,\u201d \u2018\u2018Enter the resolution,\u201d and other similar directions.\n\nThe court book is not only a source of information, but it also serves as a guide\nto the other records of the company. That all of the twenty-one documents men-\ntioned but not entered in the court book have been found in other collections is\nmost important and interesting.

There are thirteen documents entered in the\ncourt book which are on record elsewhere, consisting of declarations or reports which\nwere published by the company, petitions and letters to the King, and orders of the\n\u201c King\u2019s council. But thirty most valuable documents are spread upon the minutes\nwhich have not yet been discovered among other papers. These include a few peti-\ntions to the King, many petitions received by the company, a number of letters from\nand to the colony, the propositions brought forward in the attempt to form a tobacco\ncontract with the King, the plans propounded by the treasurer for the advancement\nof the enterprise, and the declarations of the state of the affairs of the company and\nof the colony by the same officer. \u00a2\n\nTHE EXTANT SUPPLEMENTARY RECORDS\nDOCUMENTS OUTLINING THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY\n\nThe organization and the method of procedure of the company have been\noutlined, in order to enable the reader to comprehend the nature of the records, and\nthrough them the machinery by which it conducted its internal affairs; but there is a\nwider and more important field to consider. The real interest in the company comes\nfrom its activity in carrying on trade and in developing the resources and\ngovernment of the colony. Again, the starting point must be the court hook, not\nonly as a guide to the records which it kept in executing its purposes, but in\ndiscovering what activities are to be traced. Two kinds of documents afford the\nclearest outline of the subject; in one are the reports which the treasurer offered to\nthe company and which are spread upon the minutes; in the other are the printed\ndeclarations and broadsides which the company issued for the purpose of securing\ninterest, confidence, and investment in the undertaking. With the same motive it\nreprinted treatises and published sermons which had been delivered before the\ncompany.\n\nThe first report of Sir Edwin Sandys after he became treasurer was offered\non November 3, 1619, in which he thus defined his policy: The resources of the\ncompany were to be augmented by settling and developing the company\u2019s land and\nby increasing the number of industries to be established, an action which must\nadvance the plantation from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement.\nThe report begins with a statement of the number of men which had been transported\n\n@ All of these documents, whether entered in the court book or not, are cited in the List o:\nRecords, and are also referred to by foot notes in this edition of the court book.\n",

The other measures discussed are indicative\nof the development which rapidly took place. First of these was the effort to\nestablish other commodities in Virginia and restrain the excessive production of\ntobacco; the second was the encouragement of a spirit of local patriotism in the\ncolony. The treasurer urges that men should be sent from the low countries to\nraise fortifications for the colony, stating that the colonists were willing to bear the\ncharges of the work since they had recently been encouraged by the charters and\ngrants of liberties. The dependence of the company upon the lotteries for an\nincome and the care to arrange for an economical transportation of the men are\nindications of the financial policy and status of the colony. The income of the\nlottery is estimated at \u00a33,500, and the total expense of perfecting the plan submitted\nis placed at \u00a34,000 or \u00a35,000.\n\nSix months later the treasurer made his annual report, which revealed to what\nextent his plans had been executed. It was issued as a broadside under the date of\nthe court in which it was delivered and describes the state of the colony from April,\n1618, to April, 1619, taken from a general letter to the company, and then proceeds to\noutline the successful activity of the colony during the succeeding year. It empha-\nsizes the erection of private plantations, the number of men sent to the company\u2019s\nland, the commodities provided for\u2014there being ten instead of two as in the former\nyear-\u2014the interest in the care of religion and education in the colony, and the stable\nfinancial condition of the company. The general receipts amounted to \u00a39,831 14s 11d\nand the disbursements were \u00a310,431 14s U7d, but the surplus in the college fund more\nthan exceeded this deficiency, the receipts from that source being \u00a32,043 02s 114d and\nthe expenditures \u00a31,477 15s 5d. The lottery was reported to have an increase in stock\nover the previous year of \u00a31,200. Although not re-elected treasurer, the financial\nmanagement remained in the hands of Sir Edwin Sandys, as is proved by the entries\nof his plans in the court book and by his private letters to John Ferrar. A scheme\noutlined in the court of July 7, 1620, is practically the measure put forth in the\nprinted declaration of June 22, 1620, and proposes a continuation of the policy stated\nabove.\n\nThe printed documents of 1619 and 1620 add but little to the plans revealed in the\ntreasurer\u2019s reports concerning the activity of the company, although the measures\ntaken to advance the comfort of the planters and of the tenants upon arrival in\nVirginia, the establishment of many private plantations, and the encouragement\ngiven to the self-government of the colony are brought out more clearly.

This was due to the massacre which paralyzed the efforts of the\ncompany for a time and forced upon it publications of defense and excuse or\ndirections of warning. While the company was torn by dissension, after 1622 the\ncolony slowly but steadily advanced. The proprietor was no longer active, and the\ncenter of interest is therefore transferred from the courts in London in which the\nplans had been conceived to the settlenient in which they were maturing.\n\nThe various publications of the company afford not only an understanding of the\nmeasures proposed, but also of their execution. They were in themselves a means of\ncarrying out its schemes. Before 1622 five of these advertisements were issued by\nthe company. The broadside hearing the date May 17, 1620, is a full statement of\nthe prosperous condition in the colony, setting forth the ability of the colony to\nreceive newcomers in its guest houses, newly built in each of the four ancient\nboroughs and in the other plantations, and describing the measures provided to sus-\ntain ministers in cach borough. It states the number of men who had been sent to\nthe public land, with the provisions allowed, and describes fully the efforts which\nhad been made to establish six industries in the colony.\u00a2\n\nA book of great importance was issued by the company in June of the same\nyear containing a series of declarations.\u2019 There were at least two editions in the\nyear 1620, having variations in the title page; in the first edition the pages are\nnumbered according to each pamphlet and the imprint is \u2018*T.

The\nnatural commodities which did not require especial cultivation, such as various kinds\nof tish, furs, woods, shrubs and berries, were of course included. But this proof of\nrapid development in the industrial habits and occupations of the colonists is most\nimportant, and the note of the shipping of the same year and the one in 1621 are\nconfirmatory. In the former is the statement of the number of men sent for each of\nfour industries, and in the latter a similar declaration. The rapid transportation\nof settlers and the development of private plantations in these two years is as sur-\nprising. Thus in 1620 six ships with 600 persons were sent to the colony, and 4U0\nmore settlers were to be sent at once, of whom 500 were destined for the com-\npany\u2019s land.

The declaration was made that for its own\ntenants the Virginia Company followed the proportionate provision as set forth in\nthis broadside.

It now remains to discover how\nthe trade was conducted and controlled, how the plantation was developed and\ngoverned, and how the business was finally destroyed.\n\nThe income which enabled the company to provide for new industries in 1619\nand 1620 was derived from the \u00a312 10s. paid by each new adventurer for each new\nshare of stock, and from the lotteries. Special collections and particular gifts for the\nadvancement of religion and of education in the colony were frequent, and thus the\naccount and management of the college land became important. Before the intro-\nduction of freedom of trade into the colony, and the dissolution of the old magazine\non January 12, 1619, 20, the company had some profit from that monopoly,\u2019 but the\nease with which returns came from the lotteries had doubtless led the company to\nabolish the monopoly of trade which had become so difficult to maintain. That the\ncompany depended on the lotteries is indicated by the following statements in the\ncourt book: On December 1, 1619, the lotteries were continued until summer because\nthere was no other means of securing money, and the plan put forth for the devel-\nopment of the colony on July 7, 1620, provided that the estimated expense of \u00a317,800\nshould be met by the income from the lotteries, which would amount to \u00a318,000.\nInformation concerning the organization for conducting the lottery is wanting.\nBooks and rolls and catalogues of prizes are referred to but have not been found.\u00a2\nThus the only documents which throw light on the system outside of the court book\nare the records of the suit of the Virginia Company against William Leveson, an\nagent for the lottery in 1613, which discloses that books and rolls had been kept. and\nthat a house for the lottery had been erected and furnished \u2018\u2018at the west end of St.\nPaules Church;\u201d a proclamation by the King for the overthrow of the lottery on\nMarch 8, 1620/21; and a few letters solicting investments.\u00b0\n\nThe investments by the company during the period of the lotteries followed\nthree lines\u2014the old magazine, the planting of the public and the college lands in\n\n@ Court Book, I, April 12, June 11, 13, 1621.\n\nb Ibid., I, November 19, 21, 1621; March 13, 1621/22.\n\u00a2 Ibid., 1, July 7, 1619.\n\n@Jhid., 1, June 24, 1619; January 12, 1619/20.\n\n\u00a2 List of Records, Nos, 28, 29, 71, 78.\n",

Hence, during the last half of the year\n1619, it made every effort to gain an account and secure a settlement of that adventure.\nThe discussion, which resulted in the adoption of free trade to the colony, reveals the\nsystem used for the control of the magazine, indicates to a slight degree the income\nwhich the company had had from that joint stock, and incidentally shows that it had\nsome returns from the public lands in Virginia.\u00a2 The numbers of men sent to the\ncompany\u2019s land and their equipment are given in the printed declarations, in the\nreports of the treasurer spread on the minutes, and in the discussions recorded in\nthe court book, and although the sums invested for the purpose are not recorded,\nthe statement was made by Sir Edwin Sandys that 800 men were sent through the\nincome from the lottery. The transportation of dissolute persons in the year 1619\nto meet the command of the King, and the settlement of boys and girls on the\ncompany\u2019s land previous to 1622, were other means used to people the public and\ncollege lands.?\n\nFive commodities enumerated in the broadside of May 17, 1620, were established\nby action of the court. No record is extant of the exact nature of the investment,\nbut it appears from the court book to have been chiefly an investment from the general\nstock. The movement for monopoly of certain industries rather than a monopoly\nof all trade began during the latter part of the year 1620, and as a result the records\ndeal extensively with plans for the sole importation of tobacco, by which a joint\nstock of \u00a315,000 was to be raised to carry out what is known as the \u2018* Somerscales\nplan.\u201d\n\nThe overthrow of the lotteries carried consternation to the company. An\nincome was essential with which to send out settlers to develop the soil or to create\nnew industries, but the general stock was so low that the company could not even\ncarry out its plans for glassworks. Finally, after several months of discussion,\nrecourse was had to special adventure or new joint stock companies for special\nundertakings, controlled by a treasurer who should be elected by the adventurers in\nthe scheme. Thus followed the creation of a series of magazines for the erection of\na glass furnace, for the establishment of a fur trade, for sending maids for wives,\nand for supplying a magazine for apparel. The records of these ventures are to he\nfound only in the court book, and the data there given is very insufficient. This, of\ncourse, meant no advantage to the general stock, and the company was forced to\ndiscover means for securing returns from the general investment and an income with\n\n@ Court Book, 1, June 24, 28, July 7, 18, November 3, December 15, 1619.\nb Iuid., December 23, 1619; January 12, February 2, 1619/20; July 3, 1622.\n",

Hence, private plantations were organized,\nand private patents and monopolies for the industry of pitch and tar, for ironworks,\nfor new discoveries were granted, while special commissions for trade along the coast\nand for fishing added to the revenue. With the exception of the movement for\nprivate plantations and for the sole importation of tobacco, but few records exist\noutside of the court book to reveal these vigorous endeavors to reap the results of\nthe great investments in the earlier years.\u00a2 The grants for private plantations to\nindividuals or groups of individuals, called hundreds, commenced as early as 1616,\nbut increased rapidly during and after 1621, there being entries in the court book of\nover fifty patents granted in four years, which provide for the transportation of at\nleast 100 men each and often for four times as many. The system by which each\nhundred in Virginia and the adventurers for the hundred in England was organized\nis to be found in the court book and in the extant records of the companies. The\nminutes of one meeting for Martin\u2019s Hundred and one for Smythe\u2019s Hundred, and\nthe forms for patents deposited in the British Museum, in addition to about seventy\npapers of Berkeley Hundred, afford a very satisfactory reconstruction of the terms of\nagreement, the expenses, the provisioning, the form of government, the instructions\nissued to the captain or governor of the hundred, and the terms of settlement with\ntenants and servants. The adventures of Lord Zouch and Lord La Warr in 1617\nand 1618, and of the Walloons and French in 1621, complete the series of which any\nrecord exists.?\n\nBut the private grants did not promise sufficient income to meet the great\ndemands for supplies from the general stock which the massacre of 1622 brought\nabout. As a result the company turned to the income from tobacco, regardless\nof its high purposes and its endeavors to enforce the production of other com-\nmodities. This feeling of the importance of a contract for the sole importation of\ntobacco took such a strong hold upon the company that from May, 1622, until\nits dissolution, Just a year later, nothing else worth mentioning is recorded in th\u00e9\ncourt book, while the quarrel concerning the salaries to be paid for the manage-\nment of the \u00a3100,000 to be invested in this project monopolized the attention\nof several courts.

The economic condition of the planter, the necessity of a revenue to\nthe company, the amount of the importation and of the customs value to the\nKing, the relations with Spain, and the economic values in England are all brought\nout in the estimates, discussions, and arguments.*\n\nDOCUMENTS DISCLOSING THE RELATIONS WITH THE COLONY\n\nThe study of the relations of the company to the colony and the development\nwithin the colony may be based on a greater variety of documents than any other\nphase of the subject, especially with regard to the political conditions. The court\nbook furnishes an understanding of the attitude and motives of the company and\noften serves to connect the data gathered from letters, instructions, commissions,\npatents, and grants. Thus the emphasis on the custom of martial law in the colony\nand the severity of penalty imposed is revealed both in the court book and in the\nextracts from Governor Argall\u2019s register.? The additional forms of government\nrequired by the development of the colony are recorded in the court book, by which\nthe company created the offices of deputies to the governor for the college and for\nthe public land, secretary, treasurer, chancellor, and surveyor, and provided for the\ncompensation of officers by grants of land, by transportation of tenants, by the\nincome of the company\u2019s land, and by allowance of fees.\u00a9 The requests for the\nappointment of a council of State and for laws and orders, urgently repeated by\nGovernor Yeardley, as recorded in the court book in 1619, give evidence that the\nsource of such development was in the colony. But the fundamental law for the\ngovernment of the colony is recorded in three documents, the instructions to Goy-\nernor Yeardley, November 8, 1618, which created the land system, the instructions\nto Governor Wyatt, July 24, 1621, which emphasized the industrial development,\nand \u2018* An Ordinance and Constitution * * * fora Councill of State and Generall\nAssembly\u201d in Virginia, which confirmed the political forms.\n\nThese documents provided for the creation of two councils.

The approval of a\nquarter court of the company, which was necessary for legalizing the acts of the\nassembly, is referred to in the court book in three places only.\u201d The constitution\nand the provisions for division of the country into cities and boroughs, recorded\nboth in the instructions and in the patents by which the government of the private\nplantations was delegated to a private body, form the basis for a study of the\nlocal systems. The records of Smythe\u2019s, Martin\u2019s, and Berkeley Hundred referred\nto above, the correspondence of Samuel Argall with Bermuda Hundred, and the\ncommissions for government issued by Governor Argall and later by the council\nof state complete the sources on this subject. The precedents for patents are\nvaluable in the information which they afford with regard to the position of the\nfollowing classes of colonists: The old adventurer not subject to rent; the\nadventurer paying money for his shares and agreeing to transport 100 persons;\nthe adventurer settling a private plantation; the individual planter.\u2019 These\ndocuments also throw light on the liberty of the individual, his exemption from\ntaxation without his consent by the colony or by the private plantation, and his\nsubmission to a government almost military in character.\n\nThe strict supervision which the company exercised over the economic, indus-\ntrial, and social conditions of the colony is to be seen in the measures enacted in\nthe courts and in the correspondence between the company and the colony, sup-\nplemented by a large number of private letters to the officers of the company.\nFour letters to the colony are mentioned in the court book, of which two have not\nbeen found, but eight others not mentioned are extant. It is more difficult to\ndetermine what letters came from the colony, due to the usually brief reports of\nthe letters in the court book, to the omission of the date from the copies of the\nletters, and from the uncertainty of the date of the receipt of the letters as noted\nin the court book. Seven letters seem to have been received by the company of\nwhich no trace has been found, while only four of the ten extant are mentioned\nin the court book.

Apparently Sir Edwin\u2019s policy to develop the\nplantation, and especially the company\u2019s land as a source of revenue, was overdone,\nand he was not as wise in carrying out his plan as he had been in forming it, since the\ncolony was unable to provide for the large numbers sent out. These complaints are\ncasually mentioned in the court book, but the Sandys-Ferrar correspondence shows\nthat it was the desire of the administration to conceal the difficulties and distress\nof the colony not only from the public but also from the hostile faction. The Man-\nchester papers preserve letters, or copies of them, which came to the company or\nto individuals in 1622 and 1623 complaining of similar deprivations in the colony.4\n\nThe company was not only interested in the economic and industrial develop-\nment and the necessary political forms of the colony, but, as Sir Edwin Sandys\ndeclared, it had a higher purpose than the Muscovy or the other commercial corpo-\nrations. This high ideal is proved by the attention which is devoted to plans for\nthe college, by the appointment of ministers, by the collections in the churches, and\nby the gifts received,\u2019 but the theory that the chief motive of the enterprise was\nreligious is not supported either by the spirit or by the data of the records.\n\nRECORDS KEPT BY THE OFFICERS IN THE COLONY\n\nThe acts of the administration in Virginia are recorded in the volume of\ncontemporary records of the company kept by the colony which are described\nabove. They consist of a series of nine orders and proclamations by the governor\nand council and of twenty-one orders, proclamations, commissions, and warrants\nissued by the governor as the executive officer of the council for the regulation\nof affairs in the colony. They cover the years 1621, 1622, and 1623, and concern\nthe collection of taxes, the designation of laborers for public works, the regu-\nlation of prices of commodities, the restraint of relations with the Indians, and\nthe control of the morals of the citizens. In addition to these documents issued\nby the governor is a series of twenty-four commissions and warrants issued to\nindividuals to act as commanders of cities and hundreds, to carry on trade with\nthe Indians, to make discoveries, to wage war upon the Indians, and to collect\nmoneys.

In fact, all of the papers after that time\nare of the same character except the records of the governor and council in Virginia.\nSince they number upward of two hundred, it will be impossible to discuss them\nseparately, but it must be remembered that in them is to be found an outline of the\nhistory of the company reaching back into the time of Sir Thomas Smythe, presented\nfirst by one faction and then by the other. The most important of these reviews\nare the charges of Captain Butler, of Alderman Johnson, and of Captain Bargrave,\nwith replies to each; the complaints of the adventurers and of the planters against the\nSandys administration, and a declaration by the \u2018\u2018 ancient planters\u201d comparing the\ntwo administrations in the colony.

The court book shows a readiness and a desire on the part of the company\nbefore 1622 to refer to the Privy Council such matters as the magazine accounts\nwhich seemed beyond their control, but it also contains declarations to the effect\nthat an interference with the patent rights is not to be tolerated. The questions\narising in those years concern the transportation of dissolute persons to the col-\nony, the right of the King to nominate men from whom the treasurer should be\nchosen, the restriction on trade to other countries, the refusal of a new charter to\nthe company, and the dissolution of the lotteries.

One of the most important documents, however, has not been found,\nsince the efforts for a new patent can not be traced beyond the statements in\nthe court book. It was first proposed November 15, 1620, and was ordered to be\ncontinued and to be confirmed by Parliament on January 31, 1620/21. On the\n22d of the following month the Lords were appointed to secure the seal, and\non April 12 the objections of the attorney-general, to whom the King had referred\nthe patent, were discussed. That it never went into effect is certain, since no\nrecord is to be found among the sign manual warrants in the record office or in\nthe signet docquet book. Furthermore, it is not enrolled in the chancery files,\nand it is not entered on the patent rolls, while in the suit of the guo warranto\nthe only letters patent cited are those already known of 1606, 1609, and 1612.\u00b0\n\nUnless the documents have been lost or the date of the entry has been mis-\ntaken the conclusion must be reached that after the surrender of the draft of the\nnew charter to the solicitor-general it disappeared from sight. During the year 1622\nthe communications between the King and the company concerned the tobacco con-\ntract and its final acceptance at the command of the King, and revealed the maturity\nof the policy of interference which had been developing during the previous years.\nThe number of accusations against the company increased during the year, and the\nrecords of the early part of 1623 abound in letters of complaint and charges of\nmismanagement from the colony. The memoranda of the Warwick party, found\namong the Manchester papers, are also essential to the understanding of the\nmovements toward the overthrow of the company. Many of the forty communi-\ncations between the King and the company are spread on the court book, while\nall of them are found in the Privy Council register.

The correspondence between\nthe King and the colony during those months of struggle concerned the latter\ncommission and established the royal authority, but the letters from the colony\nwere addressed to the company as late as the close of the year, six months after\nthe judgment was rendered in the guo warranto suit.\n\nThe record of this suit is found in the coram rege roll of the Kings Bench. In\nthe entry the usual writ served upon the company is followed by the information\nread by Edward Offley, the attorney for the company, citing the letters patent of\n1606 and especially of 1609. It enumerates the rights granted to the corporation,\nand claims that other privileges were never used. The third document is the reply\nof Attorney-General Coventry in which he prays for the conviction of the accused\non account of the usurpation of privileges, and cites those mentioned in the infor-\nmation, claiming that there had not been sufficient answer in any point. The answer\nof Nicholas Ferrar and others states that the company is ready to verify its rights\nas quoted. The judgment was rendered on the morrow of Holy Trinity, and\ndeclares that Nicholas Ferrar and the others are convicted of the usurpation of\nprivileges and that the \u2018\u2018said privileges are taken and seized into the hand of the\nKing and the said Nicholas Ferrar and others shall not intermeddle but shall be\nexcluded from the usurpation of liberties, privileges, and franchises of the same so\ntaken from the King, and that they are to satisfy to the King his fine for the usurpa-\ntion of said privileges.\u201d The writ of guo warranto was issued out of the Kings\nBench on the Tuesday next after the morrow of All Souls (November 4, 1623).\nThe suit was opened on the Friday after the quindecim of St. Martin\u2019s (November\n28), and was then postponed until the eighth of Hillary (January 20). It was\npostponed a second time to the quindecim of Easter (April 11), and judgment was\nfinally rendered on the morrow of Trinity (May 24, 1624).\n\nVALUE OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS\n\nIt has been the purpose of this paper to give to the reader a knowledge of\nwhat records the Virginia Company kept and to afford a guide to the extant\nrecords, as well as to indicate the character and importance of the various col-\nlections of records and of the various classes of documents. The value of this\nseries of papers is threefold\u2014it discloses the organization and activity of the\ncompany; it aids in an understanding of the various problems, policies, and con-\nditions of the State under the early Stuarts; and it is of great importance in a\nstudy of the entire movement of the earlier and of the later century for\nexploration, for trade, and especially for colonization.\n",
    "330": "104 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe object of the previous discussion has been to show that an intimate knowledge\nof the mechanism of the company, of the methods of other corporations and business\nhouses, of the policies of the company toward the plantation, of the growth of the\ncolony, and of the change in the attitude of the Crown may be gained from the\nvarious documents. Thus the value of the records in revealing the methods employed\nby the company in conducting its courts, in keeping its books, in securing capital, and\nin finding investment which would result in immediate returns and enable the com-\npany to transport men to the colony, has been pointed out. The evidence of the\nchange of the plantation from a colony for exploitation to a colony for settlement,\nand the consequent effort of the company to stimulate exploration, settlement, and\nthe development of resources, as well as the proof of the liberality of the proprietors\nin advancing self-government, has been outlined.\n\nThe indication in the records of the colony that the control changed from absolute\nauthority centralized in the governor to local management and government through\na representative legislative assembly, and that the social conditions developed from\nlife in a few compact settlements to plantation life has been suggested. Moreover,\nthe documents which show the efforts of the joint-stock companies to gain protection\nand become privileged monopolies, on the one hand, and the tendency of the Crown,\non the other, to utilize the company to relieve the country of its undesirable popu-\nlation, to secure a share in the revenue, and finally to assume the full proprietorship\nof the colony has been cited.\n\nThe court book and other records of the company have another value in that\nthey incidentally aid in an understanding of many problems of the government. Thus\nthe attitude of the King toward the company was much influenced by his desire for\nmarriage relations with Spanish royalty. Various questions of policy were often\ndiscussed in the meetings of the company, such as the freedom of trade and of\nfishing, monopolies, customs, and shipping, while the financial aid given to colo-\nnization by Spain is cited in contrast to the action of England, and the favor\nto the Spanish colonies by the State in allowing the sole importation of certain\nproducts was dwelt upon. The desire to cement the colony to the State and the\nnecessity of avoiding separation was much emphasized, but the wisdom of allowing\nself-government to the colony was never once forgotten. In fact, the argument that\ndemocracy was unavoidable, since the planter had the privilege of the adventurer,\nwas urged in opposition to the accusations of the King that the company favored\ndemocratic forms. This spirit in the company is also seen in the tendency to\naddress Parliament whenever possible, us illustrated in the movement for a new\npatent and in the settlement of the tobacco question.\n\nThe economic and industrial situation in England is perhaps better revealed than\nany other phase of affairs. Thus the commodities which were in demand and not\n",
    "331": "UNDER THE SANDYS-SOUTHAMPTON ADMINISTRATION 105\n\nproduced in England, the rates of such commodities, the prices of necessities, and\nthe system of vending goods were all matters of great importance to the company,\nand appear again and again in the various documents. The poverty of skilled labor\nis shown in the necessity the company was under to go to the Continent for men to\nsuperintend and carry on every industry which it attempted to establish in the col-\nony. Dutchmen, Swedes, Poles, and Frenchmen were thus imported for conducting\nsawmills, cultivating silkworms, and making potash, clapboards, salt, wines, and\nglass. When engineers for constructing fortifications were desired, General Cecil\ndeclared that he had not men for the purpose, but hoped he might be able to recom-\nmend some Frenchmen of ability. The papers which concern the transportation of\nvagabonds and of boys and girls furnish a comment on a special phase of social\nlife, while the spirit of the entire records reveals the demand for an outlet for\nactivity and an opportunity for investment.\n\nThroughout, the minutes of the courts and the correspondence and references\nto the other trading companies emphasize the strong similarity between their\norganization and that of the Virginia corporation. Illustrations of this fact are seen\nin the citation of the precedent from other joint-stock companies of employing a\ndeputy and a director, of the salaries paid in the Kast India Company, and of the\nliberty of trade enjoyed by the Muscovy Company; while among the Ferrar papers\nare drafts of petitions from the Commons to the King in the writing of Nicholas\nFerrar on behalf of the Turkey merchants and of the \u2018\u2018Ginny and Binny\u201d company,\nshowing the intimate relations between the different movements.\n\nPerhaps the most important result of a study of the Virginia Company comes\nfrom the knowledge which may be gained of the whole movement which had as its\nobject exploration, trade, and settlement before and since the time of the company\nin all of the colonies. In its records are to be found one of the earliest sources of\ninformation concerning colonial experience from the English standpoint, and bence\nthrough them may be gained an understanding of the way in which proprietary\ncolonies were established; of the development of the plantation into a colony of\nsettlement; and of the consequent relation between the settlers and the proprietor.\nThese steps as well as those by which the Crown was led to resume the authority\nand to establish a royal proprietorship in place of that of a company or of an indivi-\ndual, and the consequent development of the freedom of the settler were repeated\nin the history of all of the proprietary colonies of America,\n",

Che Hate of the Orininal Records\u201d\n\nIt was in July, 1622, that the controversy between the factions in the company\nwas first brought before the Privy Council, and, strangely enough, the plaintiff was\nJobn Bargrave, who later championed those whom he now accused. The complain-\nant declared that he had lost 6,600 pounds through the \u2018unjust practices and\nmiscarriage of government\u201d on the part of Sir Thomas Smythe and Alderman\nRobert Johnson. The matter was referred to a committee composed of Lord\nViscount Grandison, Lord Brook, the master of the rolls, Lord Keeper Coventry,\nand Secretary Conway, but the affair dragged on in the council until it was finally\nsettled on January 22, 1622/3, by its ordering Bargrave to forbear troubling Sir\nThomas Smythe.\u2019? From that time the battle between the factions in the company had\nbegun. The tobacco contract between the lord treasurer as representative of the\nKing on the one hund and the company on the other, which had occupied so much of\nthe time of the courts, was allowed by the Privy Council on the 2d of February.\u00b0\nBut the spirit of conflict was seen in the entire correspondence, and during the few\nsucceeding months bitter complaints concerning the mismanagement of affairs in the\ncolony were made by Nathaniel Butler in his Unmasking of the Colony of Virginia\nand by Alderman Johnson in his Declaration.t That both of these originated in the\nWarwick faction has been revealed by the Manchester papers.\n\nOn April 17 a committee headed by Lord Cavendish was summoned before\nthe Privy Council to defend the Virginia Company against the \u2018grievances of\nPlanters and Adventurers.\u201d As a result, the first blow was struck at the liberty\n\n@That the Virginia Company had a large number of records which are not now extant hag been\nrevealed by a study of the existing documents.

If the papers of the private plantations and hundreds which\nare represented by the Smyth of Nibley papers, were added to these, the volume of missing records\nwould become very great.

From that time the affairs of the company were\nunder surveillance, and the correspondence, the trade, and even the personal liberty\nof its officers were subject to restraint. The company was immediately forbidden\nto receive any private letters except on its own business, while on the 28th of the\nsame month its letters were disallowed by the Privy Council because they failed\nto \u2018\u2018certify the King\u2019s grace to the Colonies.\u201d Already the court books and other\nwritings had been required of the secretary of the company, as is shown by a\nreceipt for the same, dated April 21, among the Ferrar papers. This receipt was\ngiven to Edward Collingwood by the clerk of the council. As a concomitant the\ncouncil dissolved the tobacco contract and reduced the former customs on tobacco\nfrom twelve to nine pence per pound. It allowed the companies the sole importation\nof tobacco, but it required that the whole crop should be brought into England.?\n\nThere were other acts which partook of the same spirit as the interference with\nthe correspondence and business of the company. On May 13 the Privy Council\nordered that Lord Cavendish, Sir Edwin Sandys, and Nicholas and John Ferrar\nshould be confined to their houses, a punishment inflicted for a contempt of an\norder of the council table against the use of bitter invectives, and brought\nabout by the complaint of the Earl of Warwick.

It reads\nas follows: \u2018\u2018Nd: All theis Patents bookes of accounts &c were delivered to\nHenry Fotherby clarke to the Comissioners, by order from the Lords the 19 of\nJuly 1624,\u201d\n\nThat these members of the Privy Council and others of the commissioners for\nVirginia had all of the original records of the company in their possession at that\ndate is thus proved. What became of them later can be a matter only of specu-\nlation. That they had been so carefully preserved and were deposited \u2018 for use by\nthe members of the commissioners,\u201d seems to indicate that the theory of their\ndestruction by the Crown is not tenable. There are two theories which seem much\nmore likely. It may be that they passed finally into the possession of the Privy\nCouncil, which evidently soon assumed the burden of the control of the affairs of the\nprovince; for, on May 13, 1625, a royal proclamation arranged for a council which\nwas to be subordinate to the Privy Council.\u201c The papers may thus have remained\nwith the King\u2019s Council until the creation of the commission for Virginia in 1631,\nwhich in turn was supplanted by the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Plantations\nin 1634.4 The commission created in July of 1624 was composed of the lords of the\ncouncil and \u2018\u2018 certain others,\u201d and the council register seems to indicate that it was\nusually the council sitting as a commission.

The\nmembers of the commission, created July 15, 1624, in whose families such papers\nmight be found, are as follows: Henry Viscount Mandeville, Lord President of the\nCouncil, Wm.

The fire at Whitehall on the 16th of January,\n1618/19, at which the privy seal, signet, and council records are supposed to have\nbeen destroyed, is sometimes suggested as the cause of the disappearance of the\nVirginia records. But the facts given above, in addition to the statement of Sir\nThomas Wilson to the King that there had been but little loss of papers since they\nhad been transferred to the new oflice refutes that theory.\u00a2\n\nIt remains for the future enquirer to examine the collections which are known to\ncontain papers belonging to the families indicated by the names of the various com-\nmissioners and of the Privy Councillors for that period.

    "339": "FATE OF THE ORIGINAL RECORDS Lite\n\na knowledge of the genealogy of the various families represented. Having found the\nheirs of the families in question, the search may then be conducted through the reports\nof the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. But this is not sufficient. Since\ntrace of the family is often lost, or no evidence can be found of collections of docu-\nments, it becomes necessary to search through every section of those reports of the\ncommission for stray sets of papers. The greatest confusion also results from the sale\nof libraries, and while the catalogues of Quaritch or Sotheby may afford a clue to the\noffer of such material for sale, often in small lots, the name of the purchaser is not\nusually to be discovered. The result is that the student must wait in patience until\nthe papers have drifted into some great depository\u2014such as the British Museum and\nthe Bodleian Library\u2014or until they have been made known to the public through\nthe Manuscripts Commission or by private enterprise.?\n\nAnother difficulty, which can not be overcome by the individual student, is the\ninsufficiency of the catalogues of early date. This is gradually being met by the\nre-issue of catalogues and calendars in the British Museum, and the Bodleian, although\nthe new catalogue of the latter is only \u2018\u2018summary.\u201d The Ashmolean and Rawlinson\npapers in the Bodleian may afford many surprises. Furthermore, the early reports\nof the Manuscripts Commission were often incomplete and too general in character.\nHowever, the more recent volumes are full calendars, and the older volumes may\nbe republished in time.\n\nIn the great collections of the British Museum are brought together the papers\nor portions of the papers of a few of the men with whom we are concerned. In\nthe Lansdowne collection are about one-third of the papers of Sir Julius Caesar,\nmaster of the rolls, which were sold at auction in 1757. Among these have been\nfound the valuable letters of John Martin and the draft of the commission of 1624.\nIn the Harleian collection, brought together by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, at\nthe close of the seventeenth century, and among the papers of Sir John Cotton, who\nwas a noted antiquarian of the time of James I, are a few important documents.\n\nThe valuable collection of the Marquis of Bath, containing the Cecil papers, has\nbeen recatalogued and found to contain nothing which concerns the company after\n1616, and nothing of the earlier period not known to Alexander Brown.\n\nTwo other collections, imperfectly calendared by the Manuscripts Commission,\nare those of Lord Sackville, of Knole, Seven Oaks, Kent, and of the Earl of\nCoventry, Croome Court, Severn Stoke, Worcestershire. Since the statement was\nmade by John Ferrar, in the later years of his life, that Sir Robert Killigrew had\nleft the Virginia papers to Sir Edward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset, our interest in\n\n@The search for the records has not only been conducted along these lines, but the collections\nbelonging to the families of the officers of State under James I, and Charles I, have been investigated.\n",
    "340": "114 INTRODUCTION\n\nthis collection is intensified. Both Sir Robert Killigrew and Richard Sackville, Earl\nof Dorset, are seen to have been vitally connected with the company and the settle-\nment of its affairs. Two other connections of this family may have brought together\ncollections which might contain Virginia papers. Richard Sackville, Karl of Dorset,\nmarried Frances, the daughter of Lionel Cranfield, the first Earl of Middlesex, and\nhe himself became heir to the Crantield house and title as third earl. The first Earl\nof Middlesex was the lord treasurer during the r\u00e9gime of the company and figures\nprominently as the individual who conducted the guo warrantv suit against the\nVirginia Company. Furthermore, Lionel Sackville West is the direct descendant\nof Lord De La Warr, of Virginia fame. The combination of the four houses of\nKilligrew, Sackville, Middlesex, and De La Warr, which were of so great importance\nin Virginia affairs, leads to the hope of a valuable collection of manuscripts. Four\ndocuments are mentioned in the report of the commission, and these refer to the\ntobacco trade, but an inquiry of Lord Sackville as to other material in his posses-\nsion clicited the reply from Lionel Sackville West that Lord Sackville knew of \u2018\u2018no\nother papers at Knole relating to the colony of Virginia than those mentioned in the\nreport of the commissioners.\u201d It may be, however, that a more careful calendar\nof this collection will disclose papers of great importance.\n\nFrom March 14, 1616, to January 11, 1620, Thomas Coventry was solicitor-\ngeneral; later, during the Sandys-Southampton administration of the Virginia\nCompany, he held the position of attorney-general. On November 1, 1625, he\nbecame lord keeper, and remained in that office during the period coinciding\nwith the organization of the colonial administration. Hence it was that, when it\nwas found from the report of the Manuscripts Commission that many of Lord\nKeeper Coventry\u2019s papers had not been investigated, the Editor addressed a letter\nto the Earl of Coventry, Croome Court. This resulted in a confirmation of the\nstatement, and a promise to search the papers which are now in the \u2018strong\nroom here.\u201d In a letter to Ambassador Choate, July 27, 1904, the Earl of Cov-\nentry made the following statement: \u2018\u2018In company with a son I went through\nthe boxes containing papers of the Lord Keeper Coventry in which I thought it\nlikely I might find the documents referring to the Virginia Company of London,\nsome time ago, but I could discover nothing relating to the company.\u201d The\nletter goes on to say that the \u2018\u2018papers are in bad condition and very difficult\nto decipher.\u201d Hence the conclusion may be reached that this most likely hiding\nplace for Virginia records is not to reveal new material.\n\nThe collections at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, and at Hatfield House, are\nextremely valuable, but T. Fitzroy Fenwick, esq., the present owner of the former,\nstates that there is no materia] in that collection relating to the early history of\nVirginia, and a manuscript catalogue, kindly loaned to the writer by Lord Salisbury,\n",
    "341": "FATE OF THE ORIGINAL RECORDS 115\n\nindicates that the papers at Hatfield House, now being calendared, have no bearing\non the subject in hand.\n\nBy tracing the family connections of the descendants of Sir Thomas Smythe and\nthe Earl of Southampton intermarriages are found which might result in the location\nof valuable papers in many of the large depositories. All of these have been\ninvestigated by the Manuscripts Commission. Thus, from Sir Thomas Smythe the\ndocuments might have been inherited by the first or the second Earl of Leicester;\nby Sir Sydney Stafford Smythe, baron of the exchequer in 1772 and last of the\ndescendants of the male line; by the eighth Viscount Strangford, vice-president of\nthe Royal Geographical Society, with whose death in 1869 the senior branch of\nthe family was terminated; and by the present Duke of Marlborough through the\nsecond marriage of Lady Dorothy Sydney Smythe, daughter of Robert, second\nEarl of Leicester. The Wriothesley family is to-day represented in the houses of\nthe Duke of Bedford and of the Duke of Portland, the former having inherited the\nLondon property of Robert, third Earl of Southampton, and the latter the Tichtield\nestate.\n\nThe large number of documents among the Smyth of Nibley papers\u00ae suggests\nthat in private collections may be many records which concern the private enterprises\nor companies formed within the corporation for setting out plantations and carrying\non trade. Other groups of manuscripts and early books have seemed to offer\nopportunities for the discovery of the missing records. But the Lambeth Palace\nLibrary, the college libraries both of Oxford and of Cambridge have proved value-\nless, with the exception of that most important group in Magdelene College,\nCambridge. Every one of the college libraries, has been searched or investigated,\nbut to no avail. All Souls College, Oxford, contains a collection of manuscripts which\nmay afford a few papers on the subject when it has been more carefully catalogued.\n\nThe fact that the original records of the company before 1619, and a compara-\ntively small portion after that date have not been discovered has led generally to\nthe conclusion that the party of the Crown destroyed the evidences of the misman-\nagement during the first decade and of the comparatively prosperous condition in\nthe second. That they failed to take into account the records in the colony and the\nFerrar transcripts of the court book is the good fortune of posterity. But the\ndestruction of the records can not properly be considered as proved until the public\ncollections have been more carefully calendared and the private collections have\nbeen more thoroughly investigated. The absolute lack of evidence that the Crown\nand its supporters held such an attitude and the knowledge that the commissioners\ntook the records into their charge \u2018\u2018for use\u201d encourages the hope that a faithful\nendeavor to discover their location may yet be rewarded by success.\n\n@Ante, p. 55.\n",

Thirdly it failed of the very end it aymed at, for it was not\nany advancem' to the planting of Martins hundred.\n\n4. ffourthly it was preiudiciall & that in a high degree to the Generall\nPlantacon, & to y\u00b0 strength, peace & prosperity of y\u00b0 Collony. [31]\n\nHe began w\" the second reason as being fresh in memory, & reading\nthe Orders in the title of Graunts, he shewed, that all Lande were to\nbe graunted either to Planters in Virginia by their persons, or to\nAdventurers by their purses, or by extraordinary merritts of service.\nThatthe Adventurers by their purses, were they onely and their Assign -\nees, who paid in their seuerall shares of\u201412\u201410\u2014to the Comon Treas-\nure for the charges of transporting men to the priuate Lands of the\nAdventurers, there was also allowance made to them of 50 Acres the\nperson. But noe further allowance for any such prinate expences as\nwas now demaunded.\n\nThen he eame to the first reason, and shewed that these Orders were\nnot newly deuised, but taken out of the Lres Pattent\u20ac, namely the\nsecond & third; diuers passages of w'\" he there openly read, importing\nthat the Land\u00a2 in Virginia were to be deuided amongst the Adven-\nturers by mony, or service and the Planters in person, and that he is\nto be reputed an Adventurer by money, who payeth it into the Com-\npanies Treasury, insomuch that if any man be admitted for an Adven-\nturer, and haue paid in noe mony to the Comion Treasury, he is to be\ncompelled thereto by suite of Lawe, yea though he neuer subscribed\nto any such payment, as is expresly sett downe in the Third Lres\nPattent\u00a2.\n\nThirdly he shewed, it was not beneficiall to them of Martins hundred\nin point of advantaging their perticuler Planta\u00e9on, for the benetitt\ngrew not by a bare title to Land, but by cultivating & peopling it so\nto reape proffitt, now of such Land it was in euery Adventurers power\nto haue asmuch as he pleased w'out any other payment: ffor if an\nAdventurer (for examples sake) who had but one share of One hun-\ndreth Acres would send ouer Twenty men to inhabite & occupy it.\n",

On the other side to enlarge a mans right vnto\nnew Land, and not to make vse and proflitt of the Old, were to increase\na matter of opinion, rather then of realty, & a shadowe rather then\na substance.\n\nLastly he said it was prieiudiciall to the Generall Planta\u00e9on in many\npoints of ymportance; first in matter of strength for those titles to\ngreat extent of Land; so to keepe other from it, would be a great\nweakning to the Collony by disioyning the parts of it one so farr\nfrom another Vis Vnita Fortior.\n\nAgaine it would be a great discouragem' to new perticule\u2019 Planta\u00e9ons\nif either they must sitt downe of bad land, the best being all taken vp\nbefore in titles, or seeke a seate farr of remote from helpe and society:\nBesides whereas by the orders now established, men are to encrease\ntheir owne Land\u00e9 there by transporting of people, and so by increasing\nthe Collony in strength & multitude, the vertue and good intent of\nthis Order wilbe defeated, if men may haue their Land@ encreased\nw\" out such transporta\u00e9on, & onely by fauo\u2019 & plurallity of voie@ in Co\",\n\n[32] Nowe as this mo\u00e9on is prieindiciall to y\u00b0 strength & encrease of\nthe Plantation, so is it also to the peace thereof, good government and\niustice: It is not inst that a man should be paid twice for the same\nthing; ffor the men transported they haue allready allowance of Land\n\u201450\u2014Acres the person whither dead or huing: And the Charges now\nspoken of was but in transporting those men.

In\nthe begining of August last in the Bona Noua were sent 100 persons for\npubliq, service, chosen w\" great care, and extraordinarily furnished,\nwhereof 50 for the Companies Land, and 50 for the Colledge Land, So\nthat making deduccon of some fewe that are dead, there were he hoped\nat this day 174 persons, placed as Tenants vpon the Publique.\n\nTherefore his first Proposition was, that the Company would be\npleased, that these Tenants for the Publiq, might be encreased this\nnext Spring vp to the nomber of 300, viz\" one hundreth for the\nGouernors Land, 100 for the Companies and 100 for the Colledge\nLand; w*\" (if he be truly informed by those whoe best should knowe\nit) being rightly imployed will not yeild lesse in value then Three\nthowsand pound\u00e9 yearely revenue for these publiq vses.
