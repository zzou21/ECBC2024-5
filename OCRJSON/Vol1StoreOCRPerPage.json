    "15": "Preface\n\nThe records, and especially the Court Book, of the Virginia Company of London\nhave long been regarded as among the most precious manuscript treasures which\nhave found a lodgment within the United States. Not only is their inherent value\nas an historical source very great, as has been explained by the editor in her\nintroduction, but a sentimental value also attaches to them. This has a twofold\norigin. It arises, in the first place, from the fact that they belong at once to the\nromantic period of our own beginnings and to the heroic period of England's great\nstruggle against absolutism. The men who figure in the pages of this record were at\nthe same time playing their parts, on the one side or the other, in the controversies\nwhich were then beginning with James I, and which were to broaden and deepen\nunder his son till England was plunged into the agonies of the great civil war. They\nwere contemporaries, and in not a few cases associates, of Coke and Eliot and\nHampden, of Bacon and Wentworth and Buckingham. The names of Sandys and\nthe Ferrars stand high on the roll of patriots by which the first generation of the\nStuart period is distinguished. These same men also, together with a long list of\nthe merchants and nobles of the time, were deeply interested in discovery and\ncolonization. As successors of Gilbert and Raleigh they were planting a new\nEngland beyond the Atlantic. About this enterprise still clung some of the spirit\nand memories of the Elizabethan seamen and their early struggles with Spain.\nIn the days when Smythe and Sandys were active the prosaic age of English\ncolonization had not yet begun. The glamour of romance, of the heroic, attaches to\nthe founding of Virginia and Plymouth, and makes them fit subjects for the poet.\nBy the time when the other colonies were founded the glow and inspiration had\ngrown faint or wholly disappeared. In the Records of the Virginia Company some\nreflection may be seen of this early zeal, of the plans and ideals to which it gave rise.\n_ Even their pages, cast in a style which is quite unusual in records of this nature,\nmake one realize that he is in the company of noble and earnest spirits, men who\nwere conscious that they were engaged ina great enterprise. The Court Book itself,\nnow that it is printed in full, will be found to be a worthy monument of English\nspeech, as it was used at the close of the Elizabethan epoch and by contemporaries\nof Shakespeare and Bacon.\n\nThe tate which probably befell the original of this record, and the unusual steps\nwhich it became necessary to take in order to secure and preserve a copy, were nat-\nural consequences of the struggles of the time, and add still further to the interest of\n\n5\n\n",
    "16": "6 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY\n\nthe text as we now possess it. Miss Kingsbury, by her use of the Ferrar papers,\nhas Leen able to establish by the clearest proof the connection of Nicholas Ferrar\nwith the transcription, and in many other ways she has added detiniteness to the\naccounts usually given of the origin and preservation of the record as we now possess\nit. The transfer of the copy of the Court Book to Virginia and its transmission\nfrom hand to hand till, through the medium of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s library, it finally\npassed into the possession of Congress fittingly concludes the remarkable history of\nthe preservation of this manuscript.\n\nThe high estimate which has been placed on its value is evidenced not only by the\nuse that has been made of it by historians, but by the long-continued efforts which have\nbeen made to secure its publication. In 1858 Mr. J. Wingate Thornton, in an article\nin the \u2018\u2018 Historical Magazine,\u201d explained the nature of the Court Book, told how it\nhad been preserved, and insisted upon the importance of its being published. \u2018\u2018 As\nthese volumes are of national rather than of local interest,\u201d said he, \u2018\u2018 reaching back\nto the very foundation of the English companies for colonizing America; as they have\nescaped the chances and mishaps of two centuries, on either side of the Atlantic,\nand as Providence has now placed them in the keeping of our National Congress,\nis it not our national duty to have them appropriately edited and published?\u201d The\nfollowing year Mr. Thornton published a pamphlet in Boston, in which he outlined\nthe history of the manuscript and again raised the question of its publication. But\nsoon the Civil War came on, and plans of that kind, especially so far as they related\nto southern history, had to be postponed.\n\nBut in 1868, three years after the close of the war, Mr. Edward D. Neill pre-\nsented a memorial to Congress, in which he dwelt on the neglect by historians of\nthese most valuable manuscripts. He stated that, while preparing his book entitled\n\u201cTerra Mariae,\u201d he had familiarized himself with the chirography of the records.\nHe now offered to undertake their editing without compensation, if he might be fur-\nnished with two copyists for a limited time and be allowed a small sum for stationery\nand contingent expenses. But this offer met with no response, and Mr. Neill was\nforced to content himself with the publication of extracts from the manuscript in his\n\u2018History of the Virginia Company of London\u201d (Albany, 1869).\n\nIn March, 1877, Mr. Robert A. Brock, of the Virginia Historical Society, pub-\nlished in the ** Richmond Daily Dispatch\u201d a \u2018\u2018 Plea for the Publication of the Records\nof the Virginia Company.\u201d In 1881 Senator John W, Johnston, of Virginia, intro-\nduced into Congress a hill which was intended to provide for the publication of the\nrecords. This passed the Senate, but failed in the House.\n\nDuring three successive sessions between the years 1885 and 1888 Dr. J, Franklin\nJameson applied to the Library Committee of Congress for permission to edit and\npublish the records without expense to the Government. His plan was to obtain a\nsufficient number of subseribers to justify the issue of the volumes by a private firm\nand to meet the cost of the sale. Another suggestion which he also made was the\nappointment of a commission which should concern itself with the publishing of\n",
    "17": "PREFACE 7\n\nhistorical material in the possession of Congress. While occupied with this matter\nDr. Jameson explained the history and value of the records to the Rhode Island\nHistorical Society, and his address was reviewed in the \u2018\u2018 Magazine of American\nHistory\u201d (vol. 21, January-June, 1889, p. 82).\n\nBut meantime some progress had been made with the actual printing of the Court\nBook. Mr. Conway Robinson had made copious extracts from it, especially of the\ndocumentary material which is contained in the second volume. His extracts the\nVirginia Historical Society published in 1889, under the editorship of Mr. R. A. Brock.\nUntil the present time this edition, in two volumes, has served the purpose of most\nstudents. But the requirements of historical study in this country have now reached\na point where more complete and critical editions of the sources are needed than have\nbeen common in the past. If this need was to be met, it became at once apparent\nthat no body of records was better adapted for a beginning than those which related\nto the Virginia Company of London. In date and subject matter they stand at the\nvery threshold of American history. In character they form a distinct and unique\ngroup of material. By the issue of a definitive edition of these records the demand\nwhich scholars have so long made for their publication would be met and satistied.\nIt was under the influence of considerations like these that the present work was\nundertaken.\n\nIn the preparation of this body of records for the press critical accuracy and\nhelpfulness have been sought in all possible ways. The spelling of the original has\nbeen carefully preserved throughout, for in editing a source of this character and\nimportance any attempt to modernize the text would be properly regarded as unjusti-\nfiable. Not only has the spelling been preserved, but also the signs and abbrevia-\ntions which abound, the use of which the men of the period had inherited from still\nearlier times. So far as such a thing is possible in print, the text is exactly repro-\nduced in these volumes, while an added element of reality is supplied by the photo-\ngraphs of specimen pages of the original manuscript.\n\nBrief notes have been added where it was necessary to explain or call attention\nto obscurities, omissions, or other irregularities in the text, the purpose being to\nenable the reader to gain information of this kind from the printed page with the\nsame certainty as if he were using the manuscript. In the notes, cross references\nhave also been given to the documents of the company and to its publications, when\nthey have been found to reproduce, or to illustrate and make more detinite, the state-\nments which are contained in the Court Book. In citations of this kind the number\nof each document is given as it appears in the List of Records in the Introduction.\nIn this way the unity of the records of the company as a whole receives illustration,\nand the investigator will be aided in any effort which he may make to learn all which\nthey have to reveal in reference to any subject. Finally, the index completes the\ninvaluable service which Miss Kingsbury has rendered in the editorship of the work.\n\nHersert L. Oscoop\nCotumpia UNIVERSITY\n",

    "21": "1. The Chararter of the Company\n\nThe individual effort which had revealed itself at the close of the medieval\nperiod in other phases of the economic development and in the military history of\nthe past quarter century was especially prominent in the movement in 1606 for a\nsociety of adventurers to trade in Virginia. The commercial advance had been\ndue chiefly to private enterprise, and the naval expeditions into the West Indies\nagainst the Spanish had been fitted out and prosecuted by such adventurous spirits as\nSir Francis Drake, while the zeal for exploration and for gold, which inspired Jolin\nand Sebastian Cabot to search for a passage to Cathay and the East Indies in 1497.\nled Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh a century later to seck out the\nresources of the lands from Florida to Newfoundland. It is the same spirit of\nadventure which inspired the narratives of Jobn Smith and Henry Spelman ax\nthey told of their relations with the Indians of America. But it is in the progress\nof both the commercial and the political life of England that the Virginia Company\nis important. For the plantation founded and nourished by a private concern as an\nenterprise purely for gain was the social cause from which developed the colony\nasa form of government. Its political organization is seen in its relations to the\nCrown, of which there were two distinct phases. During the first three years it\nwas distinctly a creature of the King, the affairs of which were conducted hy the\nKing through a council created by himself and responsible to himself. while to the\ninvestors were left the privileges of raising the funds, furnishing the supplies. and\nsending out the expeditions. It was a modification of this form of management to\nwhich the government reverted after the dissolution of the Company in 1624, and\nagain at the end of the century when royal colonies were substituted for proprietary\nand corporate forms throughout America. In the second phase the undertakers\nbecame distinctly proprietary, retaining the commercial responsibilities, but assum-\ning governmental functions in place of the King.\n\nA comparison between the royal grants for discovery in the sixteenth century\nand those of the Virginia Company shows that there was an increase in the\ndirect territorial relations between King and subject, a limitation upon monopoly\n\nra\n",
    "22": "12 INTRODUCTION\n\nof trade, and a tendency on the part of the Crown to retain directly or indirectly\nthe powers of government. Thus, in the letters patent to Richard Warde, Thomas\nAshehurst, and associates in 1501,\u00a2 to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, and to Sir\nWalter Raleigh in 1584,\u2019 the Crown conferred proprietorship of land with the\nright to grant it out in fee simple at will. But in 1606 the land was held by the\nundertakers, and again in 1609 by the adventurers and planters in free and common\nsocage, as of the manor of Greenwich of the county of Kent. Under the first Vir-\nginia charter it was granted by the King to those approved by the council; under\nthe second, by the members of the company to anyone who should have adventured\na certain sum of money or bis person. The fief, distinctly so called in the early\ncharters, for which homage was to be rendered, with no service, however, save that\nof one-fifth of the gold and silver gained, had disappeared; and the only direct feudal\nrelation with the King which remained arose from the requirement of a per cent of the\nprecious metals. The monopoly of trade by which Warde, Gilbert, and Raleigh were\nallowed to seize and detain any one who trafficked within two hundred leagues of a set-\ntlement was altered in 1606 so that the planters had only the right of collecting a\ntax from such interlopers. The rights of government which had been surrendered\nabsolutely to the grantees in the sixteenth century charters were reserved to the\nKing by the letters patent of 1606 to be exercised through the council. In 1609\nthese powers were conferred on the company as an open body, it must be remem-\nbered, and thus differed from the earlier grants and from the later proprietary grants\nto Lord Baltimore or to William Penn,\n\nAlthough the charter emphasizes the government of the plantation, the Virginia\nCompany was purely a commercial enterprise conducted by a private concern, even\nbefore the charter of 1609, as is shown by the history of its early years. It was\nbacked by the patronage of the King, hut only for the purpose of advancing the trade\nof the Kingdom in foreign parts and saving the Crown from expense and responsi-\nbility, as had been the policy in regard to the other trading companies. Nevertheless,\nit was a step toward colonial expansion, for, as has well been said, \u2018\u2018 the explorer is\npotentially a colonizer,\u201d and the army of laborers on the plantation became in time\nan army of free tenants in a colony. While in the spirit of its commercial life the\ncompany was closely allied to the efforts for exploration and search for gold, morally\nsupported by Elizabeth in her feudal grants, in its organization, as well as in its pur-\npose, it resembled the private companies for trade based on ancient charters, and in its\ndevelopment is to be understood only through a knowledge of both of these earlier\nmovements.\n\n\u00abBiddle, Cabot, Appendix, pp. 312, 314, for this charter.\nbHakluyt, Principal Navigations, VIII, 17-23, 289-296.\n\u00a9 Osgood, H.

    "23": "CHARACTER OF THE COMPANY 13\n\nThus in order to protect trade, but not for exploration and settlement, the ancient\ncharters granted to the Merchant Adventurers in 1407 and 1462, and particularly the\none of 1564, incorporated that company into a \u2018* Body Politick.\u201d\u201d. The words of the\ngrant declared its purpose to be \u2018\u2018for the good Government, Rule and Order of\nthe * * * Fellowship of Merchants Adventurers * * *, As also of all and\nevery other of the subject of our heirs * * * using the seate of Trade of the\nsaid Merchants Adventurers * * *.\u201d%\u00a24 This was also the object expressed in\nthe charter to the East India Company,\u2019 although it contained an additional provi-\nsion for the acquisition of lands by purchase. Monopoly of trade and powers of\ngovernment over factors, masters, or others in the employ of the company were\nconferred, but the exemption from customs was to continue for only four years, and\nthe only settlements provided for were to have the form of factories. It hud been\nestablished as a regulated company, that is, one in which each individual invested his\nown capital subject to the rules of the company; but in 1612 by increasing the\nimportance of the directors and investing sums for a limited period it became a\njoint stock company.\u00a2\n\nAs a prototype of the companies later incorporated both for discovery and\ntrade, such as the Virginia Company, the Muscovy or Russian Company, known as\n\ne \u2018* Merchant Adventurers of England for the discoveries of lands and territories\nunknown,\u201d was established in 1555 with a joint stock of \u00a36,000, Sebastian Cahot\nwas appointed governor for life and with him was associated a hoard of directors of\n4 consuls and 24 assistants. However, this company had also the rights of the compa-\nnies for exploration \u2014that is, those of conquest, of acquiring lands, and of seizing the\nships of any who should infringe on their monopoly of trade.\u201d In 1583 a conimmittee\nfrom the Muscovy merchants drew up a set of resolutions concerning a conference\nwith M. Carlile upon his \u2018\u2018 intended discoverie and attempt into the hithermost parts\nof America,\u201d\u00ae which was not dissimilar to the plan of Sir Walter Raleigh, and hence\nforeshadowed companies of the seventeenth century. It proposed to send forth\n100 men for one year, providing \u00a34,000 for the adventure, in order to gain a\n\u201cknowledge of the particular estate of the country and gather what commodity\n\n@Lingelbach, The Merchant Adventurers of England, 218-236 for extracts frem the charters.

The scheme differed from the sixteenth century\nenterprises, which were especially intended for exploration, in that no question of\ngovernment was considered, but it conformed to the ideas of Gilbert and Raleigh\nand of the trading companies, in that its rights over trade were to be purely\nmonopolistic.\n\nApparently this plan of the Muscovy Company stands as a connecting link\nbetween the ideas of the explorer and those of the trader and the planter, a plan which\nmay be said to have been carried out by the Virginia Company. It is significant that\nmany of the members of the Virginia Company were men who had taken part in the\nexpeditions of the late sixteenth century and had been interested in certain private\nvoyages of exploration carried on during the five years preceding the receipt of its\nfirst charter, while most of the leaders of this company were at the same time stock-\nholders and even officers in the Muscovy Company, the Company of Merchant\nAdventurers, the East India Company, and later of the Turkey, the Guinea, and\nthe African companies.\n\nIt is unnecessary to cite the charters of other companies or to search the history\nof the trading corporations of the sixteenth century in order to show that the Virginia\nCompany was similar in character. But, like the Muscovy Company and the East\nIndia Company, it was established to carry on trade in new and uninhabited lands,\nand hence had the additional features of a company whose purpose was exploration\nand plantation. The latter characteristic appears more especially in the charter, the\nformer in the instructions and correspondence of the entire period of its life. The\nobject of its first undertakers was doubtless to search for minerals and for a route to\nthe southwest, and to secure for trade the materials which were native and peculiar\nto those regions. The plantation was a necessity for this purpose, and incidentally,\nbecause of the character of the country, it was forced to become a colony. To estab-\nlish a settlement which should become a market for English goods, to advance the\nshipping, to spread the religion of the Kingdom were doubtless motives which\naroused sympathy for the undertaking; but the arguments which brought investment\nwere the opportunities for gain.\n\nThe position of the Virginia Company in the development of English exploration\nand trade was therefore important, and the study of its history is of value not only\nfor the light which it throws on Virginia itself but for an understanding of the\neconomic condition of England as well. Nor is this all. The few private records\nwhich remain of the Merchant Adventurers Company and those of the East India\n",

The fact that the private records, the books\nfrom which the knowledge of the actual financial transactions could be obtained,\nare missing in most cases, may prove that their loss in the case of the early Virginia\nCompany is not due to intentional destruction, but to the general opinion of the\nperiod that such material was valueless.\n\nThe only other enterprise of which there is sufficient material for anything like an\nexhaustive study is the East India Company, and hence its records combine with\nthose of the Virginia Company to supply a source of information concerning all of\nthese companies. The conclusion seems valid, therefore, that the great mass of min-\nutes, orders, instructions, letters, and memoranda of the company for Virginia will\naid in the interpretation of the comparatively few records of the earlier associations.\nThe records of this company are necessary to enable one to comprchend the life\nof the other companies, as is its history to the understanding of their development.\n\nIt was during the life of the company that the plantation gradually assumed the\naspects of a colony, that the settlement which was originally planned for exploration\nand the discovery of gold became a center for the development of the natural and\nagricultural resources of the surrounding country. The origin within the colony\nof the assembly, of local government, of private ownership of land, and of freedom\nof trade is to be found before the dissolution of the company by the Crown. There-\nfore the records of the company, as well as those of the colony, form the material\nthrough which the history of the beginnings of English colonies, viewed from the\nstandpoint of the colonist, is to be gained.\n\nTheir value for the comprehension of the development of political institutions\nin England is not so patent. The growing correspondence between the Crown and\nthe company and the interference in the acts of the company stand as evidence of\nthe gradual increase of the interest of the Crown or its council in the undertaking.\nThis interest was most apparent when the tobacco trade promised a revenue to the\nCrown, but the encouragement of the growth of other staple products, the spasmodic\nrevival of acts touching English shipping and the balance of trade, and the main-\ntenance of staple ports in England are all new activities appearing in the records of\nthe company. Throughout, also, is apparent the readiness to allow the already\nuncertain economic policy to be altered or nullified by the political relations with\nSpain, or because of moral or whimsical views.\n\nThe gradual definition of policy on the part of the Stuarts, perhaps first apparent\nunder Charles I, is closely connected with the leaders of the Virginia Company.

The appointment of the commissions to\ninvestigate the affairs of the company and the condition of the colony, the creation\nof a commission for the control of the colony after the overthrow of the charter, the\nlater appointment of a committee of the Privy Council for the same purpose are all\nsteps in the growth of a colonial system and of a colonial policy. Although the\nmaturity of this system and policy is not reached until after the Commonwealth, the\ninfluence of the associates of James 1 and of Charles I is apparent.\n\nEvery phase of colonial development, from the mixed system which existed\nunder the patent of 1606 to the chartered proprietary company after 1609 and the\nroyal province after 1624, is here illustrated. The transition from the chartered\nto the Royal Government in 1624, the prelude to \u2018\u2018the most important transition in\nAmerican history previous to the colonial revolt,\u201d is only to be understood from\nthese records, since the tendency to self-government in the colony is one of the\npretended reasons for the overthrow of the company. All the steps of the change\nare to be traced in the royal correspondence, in the memoranda of the royal party,\nand in the record of the suit under the writ of quo warranto. The significance of\nsuch material is best understood from the fact that \u2018\u2018the constitutional law and\npractice of the old colonial system has not yet been attempted to be known,\u201d and\nas yet no book has been written concerning the forms or functions of the British\nGovernment as employed in colonial administration.\n",

Examples of the private\ninterests are the enterprise of the Earl of Southampton in 1605 and that of Lord\nZouch as set forth in his contract? with Captain George Waymouth of October 30,\n1605. In this Lord Zouch agreed to secure and provide two ships and 200 men of\n\u201carts suitable for a colony,\u201d and to pay \u00a3100 to Captain Waymouth for the trans-\nportation of the same. The interesting feature is the agreement, suggestive of\nfeudal relations, that Lord Zouch should be the first officer and have the first choice\nof land, while Captain Waymouth as second officer should have second choice of\nland, which he was to hold from the former as lord paramount for himself, his\nheirs and assigns. At the same time Sir John Popham was busily engaged in the\nattempt to form royal colonies by obtaining charters from the Crown, whereby the\nterritory from 34\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude should be taken under the protection of\nthe King, and private settlements should thus be excluded.\n\nThe plan which obtained followed neither course, though it was bound to result\nin a modification of Popham\u2019s scheme. The motives of the grantees and the\narguments which induced the King in 1606 to abandon the policy of Elizabeth and to\ngive royal patronage to the undertaking, and even to assume royal control, are set\nforth in a petition presented to Parliament in 1606, entitled \u2018\u2018 Reasons for raising a\npublique stocke to be imploied in the discovering of such countries as may be found\nmost convenient * * * .\u201d% It is evident, however, that the unknown plan of\ninvestment in the adventure of 1606 is not here suggested, since there was no intima-\ntion of financial support by the King.

The desirability of a revival of the declining export trade, as well as that\nof establishing the importation of necessities from a part of the dominions, though\ndistant, was urged, together with the importance of strengthening by settlement\nthose countries already acquired by discovery. That such undertakings by private\nenterprise had been failures; that it was more honorable for the State to back an\nexploitation by public consent than by private monopoly; that public colonies were\nbound to be more obedient and industrious because of the greater confidence in the\ncharacter of the control, were all reasons which had long before been set forth\nwhereby to gain the support of the Crown.\n\nCHARTER OF 1606.\n\nThe royal aid as finally obtained for a colonial enterprise came in a somewhat\ndifferent form. The letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates and others for plantations\nto be made in Virginia\u00ae show that the investment was made solely by individuals,\nand that the joint stock was not public, although in the regulation of affairs in\nthe colony the body of undertakers was to have little influence, even as far as its\ncommercial interests in the plantation were concerned. The business management\nwas left to the joint stock companies, and the magazine was controlled by a treasurer\nor cape merchant and by two clerks elected by the President and Council in the\nColony. In fact, the only activity of the adventurers, so far as it is revealed in\nthe extant documents, consisted in the choice in London of one or more groups of\nagents, called \u2018\u2018 companies,\u201d to manage the goods sent out and received and to\nlook after the profits.

Of these the most\nimportant are the reports of Captain Newport, and the relations of John Smith, of\nEdward Maria Wingtield, and of George Percy.* The council had dispatched three\nexpeditions, all under Captain Newport; one in December, 1606, in three ships\nwith 120 emigrants; another in October, 1607, with two vessels and about the same\nnumber of passengers; and a third in August of 1608 with about 70 emigrants.\n\nThe reports of Newport, Percy, Wingfield, and Smith encouraged the managers\nof the enterprise to continue their efforts, but proved that a change in object as well\nas in policy would be necessary. From Newport came descriptions of the fruitful-\nness of the soil, of the quantities of fish and of timber, and of clay for making brick,\nand enumerations of the possible exports, comprising sturgeon, clapboard, wainscot,\nsaxafrage, tobacco, dyes, furs, pitch, resin, turpentine, oils, wines, wood and soap\nashes, iron, copper, pearls; but the reports as to the mines were vague. He\ndeclared that the country was rich in gold and copper, and took home with him earth\nto be assayed, while Smith, in A 7rue Relation, states that he had been left to dig a\nrock which Captain Newport thought was a mine, but no mention of results is made.\n\nThe full description of the country by Newport and also by Captain John Smith\ngave the council a clear idea of its geography, as is indicated by the instructions to\nSir Thomas Gates in 1609. But the expedition, which penetrated to a distance of 160\nmiles up the river, brought the explorers to hostile tribes and left the council still\nuncertain, though hopeful of the discovery of a passage to the south sea. Further-\nmore, Captain Newport positively stated that there could be no commerce with the\nIndians, and all evidence shows that the natives were to be a resource for the neces-\nsities of life rather than for the exchange of lucrative objects of trade.

Then, too, the regulation of the affairs of the colony without any control\nfrom the council in England meant continued jealousies and quarrels among such a\nsmall number of colonists and under such unsettled conditions. According to\nWingfield the provisions for defense seem to have been insufficient, the magazine\nwas mismanaged, and the relations with the Indians were strained.

This failure of the investment to bring in\nreturns of gold and silver and of articles for trade, or to accomplish anything in\nthe way of discovery of trade routes to the East Indies during the first three years,\nserved to convince both King and undertakers that a change in method of control\nwas essential. The document known as \u2018\u2018 Reasons against publishing the Kings\ntitle to Virginia. A justification for planting Virginia\u201d? seems to show an agitation\namong the investors arising from fear lest the desire to placate Spain, or religious\nconsiderations, might lead the Crown to abandon the scheme. The arguments there\nadduced may well explain the readiness of the King to surrender not only the com-\nmercial and territorial control but also full rights of government to the corporate\nbody of the Virginia company, and thus to avoid any rupture with Spain. Certain\nit is that the desire for more direct authority and for securing larger investments\nwere the motives of the petitioners in asking for a new charter.\n\nAsa result of this movement the letters patent of 1609 were issued, transform-\ning the undertakers into a body politic. In this case also the documents are\nespecially characteristic of the organization. Whereas the Crown was formerly the\nsource of all power, beginning with 1609 the council of the company, acting as a\nstanding committee for the adventurers rather than in the name of the King,\nexercised the controlling authority. After the charter of 1612 had provided for\nmore frequent meetings of the generality, the council was gradually superseded by\nspecial committees and the tendency arose to decide all matters of importance in\nthe general quarter courts and to insist upon ail communications being addressed\nto the company rather than to the council. The act of incorporation erected a\ncommercial company and made it the overlord of a proprietary province.

In\n1618, under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe, the adventurers were com-\npelled to appeal to the Crown because of the complications with France which arose\nfrom the expedition of Sir Samuel Argall along the northern coasts of America,\u2018\nwhile a similar relation was brought about by the controversy with Spain with regard\nto the attack on Spanish vessels by the ship Zreasurer in 1619.4 In both instances\nthe protection desired was granted. When the financial stringency forced the adven-\nturers to great efforts in 1614, and they appealed unsuccessfully to Parliament for\naid, the Privy Council attempted to arouse confidence in the undertaking throughout\nthe country.

But\nmuch of this information is lacking in the completeness and authenticity which\nwould have been supplied by the court book and the other records. The greatest\nloss is perhaps that of definite knowledge concerning the financial status of the\ncompany. The sums adventured by individuals and corporations is preserved in\ntwo alphabetical lists; but, so far as is known, only one of these lists is official, and\nthat includes the names of the particular adventure about the year 1610.2 The other\nis an unpublished list apparently both incomplete and unofficial, and was probably\nmade somewhat later than 1618 at the order of the court,\u2019 although the date 1618\nhas been assigned to it in the Manchester papers, where it is to be found.? From\nthe records of the various London companies and from records of English towns,\nas also from adventures sealed to individuals by the Virginia Company, comes the\nmost authentic information concerning the large sums invested during this decade.\nIn a similar way the knowledge, otherwise to be found in the court book and \u2018\u2018The\npticulers of the Boates,\u201d concerning the ships dispatched and the sums expended for\nthe equipment of planters, individuals, and companies, is scattering and indefinite.\nThe broadsides issued are calls for adventurers, planters, and colonists, with the\nrequirements or statements concerning the lottery schemes; but they do not furnish\nthe wide information which is found in those of the later period.

Judging\nfrom the sources of information in the later period, this uncertainty is due to the\ndisappearance of the letters themselves, since, after 1619, the published relations of\nindividual planters, the declarations by the company, and even the records of the\ncourt books are all more general in character than the letters which were sent from\nthe colony to the company. Furthermore, in the later period the daily acts of the\ncolonists and their needs, as reported from time to time by returning ships, afforded\nthe adventurers a body of information concerning the social condition of the colony\nwhich in form and accuracy left little to be desired. After the time of Captain John\nSmith not much was accurately known of the colony until the year 1617, when\nCaptain John Rolfe and Ralph Hamor supplied statistics as to the numbers, condi-\ntion, settlements, and resources of the colony as it then was.\n\nThe individual enterprises of this decade in the life of the company are\naltogether unknown, except from a few contracts for shipping found here and\nthere. Such movements must at least have been noted in the court book.

The factions which developed and which resulted\nfinally in the dissolution of the company evidently existed in this period, for a letter\nfrom Chamberlain to Carleton, dated May 8, 1619,\u00b0 in which he speaks of the failure\nto reelect Sir Thomas Smythe as treasurer of the Virginia Company as having\nbeen \u2018\u2018somewhat bettered at a later meeting of the Summers Island Company by his\nchoice as treasurer of that company,\u201d proves that the change was due to factional\ndifferences, although the extant court books open with the refusal of Sir Thomas\nSmythe to continue as treasurer.

These instructions to Gates\nand De La Warr afforded the authority for the termination of the previous govern-\nment in Virginia, the stated ideas of the company as to locations for settlements,\nforts, and magazines, and concerning journeys inland. It also included an interesting\nreference to Raleigh\u2019s colonists. The general policy in administering the affairs of\nthe colonists and the detailed orders as to the relations with the Indians, as far as\nthey concern guards, trade, and treaties, and the daily life of the inhabitants, indicate\na definiteness in the control of the company which formerly was not understood.\nIn such a revelation of the knowledge of the country and of the natives there is a\n\n\u00abScattering information of such a character concerning this period appears in the discussions\nand quarrels recorded in the later court books.\n\nb List of Records, pp. 123-124, Nos. 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31.\n\nThere are three cases recorded in the chancery proceedings in which the company attempted to\nenforce the payment of adventured sums.

Here was the\ngerm which was to develop into the colony, but the plan was as yet by no means\nso far-reaching. A common store, a common magazine, common refectories, labor\nby groups with a superintendent for each five or six persons, the prohibition of\ntrade with the Indians except through the truck merchant were economic methods\nwhich looked to the gain of the adventurer in London rather than to the develop-\nment of a colonial settlement.

In order to increase the\ncapital stock, the company made personal appeals and issued printed statements and\ndescriptions which it scattered broadly. The story is told in the lists of adventurers\ncited above, in the earnest endeavors to secure new planters and new adventures from\nindividual town and guild, in the efforts to enforce the payment of sums already\nadventured, in a few receipts concerning tobacco, in the lottery schemes, which were\nlegalized by the charter of 1612, and in printed broadsides and declarations. Thus the\nsums adventured by individuals, by the various London companies, and by the towns\nof England are given in a series of requests for adventure and in bills of adventure*\nissued by the company and found in the records of those companies and towns? as\nalso in private collections. The chancery proceedings, in three suits, state that the\ncompany attempted to secure an adventure of \u00a318,000 and the equipment of 600\nmen during the year 1611, and the failure to accomplish its purpose was set forth by\nthe defendants as a reason for refusing to pay the sums adventured. Incidentally\nthere was mentioned an income in the year 1613 of \u00a38,000 from the lottery, of\n\u00a32,000 from the sale of the Somers Islands, and of \u00a3600 or \u00a3800 from the disposal\nof the ship De La Warr. However, with the exception of an unpublished letter\nfrom Sandys to the mayor of Sandwich\u201d concerning the adventure by that town, in\nwhich he inclosed a list of the subscribers to that particular adventure, with the sums\nset down by each,\u2019 the official records reveal but little as to the sums which must\nhave been received by the company.\n\nIn a similar manner there are unauthentic records of economic value concerning\nthe lotteries and the importation of tobacco.

It also holds out the promise of improved conditions\nunder Gates and De La Warr, who are to be shortly sent to Virginia with a complete\noutfit of men and provisions. The second document describes the southern part of\nthe country and cites the advantages of Florida as evidence of the opportunities\nin Virginia. After the time of De La Warr the published accounts of the plans,\nmovements, and successes of the colonists became more complete. While the state-\nments of De La Warr in his Aelation are a bare outline of the conditions as he\nfound them and the improvements in trade and discovery to which Captain Argall\nhad contributed, together with his lordship\u2019s plans for the future, it is of value\nas forming, with Hamor\u2019s narrative four years later, a surprisingly accurate and\nsatisfactory treatment of the development in the colony during those years.\n\nHamor gives a clear statement of the methods and success of Captain Dale in his\nrelations with the Indians, of his organization and reform of the colony, and of his\nestablishment of order therein, and reveals clearly the state of affairs on the arrival\nof Gates, the cause of the failure heretofore, and the details of the building of the\nsuccessive towns, with descriptions and statistics for each.

Then, too,\nthe first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610-1612,\nmartial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the\ncompany now proposed;* the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a\nminimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and\nthe produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early\nsettlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall,\nlike Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the\nIndians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted\nin the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south,\nwhich became self-supporting and independent of the \u2018\u2018supplies\u201d from England.\nThis meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward\nthe colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be\nabandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family\nhad been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had\nbeen sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent.\n\nWhether the company made any resistance to this development within the set-\ntlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter,\nwill only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain\nthat by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They\nhad then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of\nthe produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the\nmonopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619,\nwhen the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most\neagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys,\nby this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House\ncommittee which reported against monopolies.\n\nTo such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir\nGeorge Yeardley in November, 1618, called \u2018\u2018The Great Charter of privileges, orders,\nand Lawes,\u201d recognized the necessity for loeal government. They provided for two\nhouses, the \u2018\u2018Council of State,\u201d to be chosen by the company in its quarter court,\nand the general assembly, to consist \u2018\u2018of the Council of State and two Burgesses\n\n\u00abFor the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Moraill and Martiall, &c., entered for publica-\ntion on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by\n\nthe lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611.\nThey are reprinted in Force, Tracts, Vol. III.\n",

There were also letters from indi-\nviduals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England.\nThey may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the\ninfluences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt\nto conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances.

In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received\nreassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the\npublications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were\n\n@List of Records, p. 129, No. 72.\n\n>There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power\nby Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619.

This abstract was probably made in 1730\nunder the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia\nat that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of\ncorrespondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and\nbetween the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of\nprivilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long con-\ntest during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent.\nThere are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and\nseveral warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to\nthose issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods\nof government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been\nchanged by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of\nreduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the\nperiod.\u2019\n\nVI.\u2014PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS\n\nWhile the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence\nreceived from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the\ninformation which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe,\u2018 addressed to\nLord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph\nHamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and\ngovernment and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location,\nthe number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other\nletters extant, similar in character, though of less value.?\n\nBut another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of\ndocuments of the company.

Che Gallections of Borwments, 1416-1624\n\nGENERAL CHARACTER OF THE REcoRDS\n\nThe character of the documents of the company after 1619 is fundamentally\nthe same as in the preceding decade. Virginia was still a proprietary province\nwith a commercial company as an overlord, and therefore the company was still\nthe immediate source of all government in the colony. To it came all appeals\nfrom colonial authorities; it exercised control over all commerce, both from and\nto Virginia; it granted all land and all privileges. Although the number of doc-\numents emanating from the Crown \u201c\u2014that is, of the first class\u2014is large, they are\nrather an indication of the increasing wealth and importance of the company, than\nof royal interference. They concern the regulation of trade, complain of the\nabuse of power by the company, or provide for the investigation of its acts\nrather than assume any authority in the direct administration of its affairs. ln\nthem interference in the management is foreshadowed, but it is not until the\ndissolution of the company that the Crown again becomes the proprietor.\n\nThe mass of materials which form the records for this period is much\ngreater than in the earlier decade. This is due on the one hand to their\npreservation in two or three collections, and on the other especially to the vast\ngrowth of business in the company and the rapid development from a colony\nfor exploitation into a colony for settlement. Thus the minutes of the company,\nforming the second class of documents, show that it conducted a larger amount\nof business than any other proprietary company.? These minutes comprise two\nlarge volumes of the court book, and fill 741 manuscript pages.\u00a9 In the third\nclass there are nine letters from the company to the governor and council in the\ncolony, and twelve from the latter body to the company, in addition to a large\nnumber of receipts, commissions, instructions, and laws.

This group consists of the \u2018\u2018court booke\u201d of the\ncouncil of the colony during the last year of the authority of the company,\ncovering about 65 pages; 54 commissions, orders, proclamations, and warrants to\nsubordinates in the colony issued by the governor and council in Virginia, and\n35 petitions to the same body from the members of the colony.* The publica-\ntions of the company for this final period of its existence number 3 large\nbroadsides, 11 declarations containing 168 printed pages, and 4 sermons and\ntreatises made up of 150 pages.? The supplementary official material found in\nthe correspondence between individuals of the company and of the colony or\nbetween members of the company in England, in addition to the records of the\nprivate companies within the larger body, includes many documents and memo-\nranda.\u00ae Sixty-six of these are preserved in the Manchester papers, while 78 are\nfrom the Ferrar papers, which are now first made known and published. The\nunofficial material, consisting of records of other companies, of towns, and of\ncorrespondence touching on the affairs of the company or colony, numbers about\n40 documents.@\n\nThe relative value of the various classes of the records for this period has\nbeen altered by the preservation of the court book which has made the other\nmaterial supplementary, or even subsidiary, with the exception of the correspond-\nence; for in it is either recorded or summarized the information which the\ncompany had received from all other sources, or which it imparted to individuals\nor to the public by other means. But the fact that the other records are\nsupplementary does not decrease their value, for they often furnish the data\nwhich are the basis of the acts and conclusions of the company, while some of\nthem also reveal the legal or political processes of the company, of the colony,\nof the courts, or of the sovereign authority, and others are of great value in the\nlight which they throw on the dissenting party within the company.\n\nThe subject-matter of the court book, as well as the character and contents\nof the various documents, proves the changed condition which the increase of\nbusiness had brought about, since a large proportion of the records deal with the\nfounding and conducting of private enterprises, and many of them are really\ndocuments of a private nature.

As a result\nof this change in commercial object had come the need of larger, more numerous,\nand more scattered settlements in the colony, and of greater co-operation on the\npart of the settlers, although it may well be claimed that the latter necessity had\nbeen urged upon the leaders by the mismanagement of Captain Argall during\nthe three years previous to the change in administration. In order to increase\nthe number of planters, concessions of privilege had been made to private parties\nor groups as early as 1618, since such investments were doubtless easier to secure\nwhen the adventure was under the immediate control of the undertaker. Simi-\nlarly, for the purpose of stimulating capital and gaining the co-operation of the\nplanters, the division of land, promised in 1609, was proclaimed in 1616. Free\ntenancy was now guaranteed to all individuals, even to indented servants, at the\nexpiration of seven years. The organization of joint stock companies for the manage-\nment of trade, which supplanted the magazine, was a movement toward private enter-\nprize. Hence it is that these subjects, together with those which concern the impor-\ntation and sale of tobacco, occupy the greater part of the court book, and must have\nconsumed most of the attention of the corporation. The burden of discussion in the\ncourts concerned the best means of marketing the products, whereas in the earlier\ndecade it must have related to the increase of capital. The records of the colony\nwere no longer simple reports to the company and instructions from the proprietor,\nbut assumed the character of political documents, since liberty of land and trade, and\nthe creation of numerous plantations and scattered settlements resulted in the growth\nof \u2018\u2018 political conditions and forces side by side with the commercial and economic.\u201d\nThe minutes of the colonial legislative assembly, the records of the colonial court, the\npetitions to the governor and council, and the commissions and orders granted by that\nbody are all distinctively new features in the records.

The\nLibrary of Congress at Washington possesses by far the largest and most impor-\ntant collection in this country.

The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records,\n1606-1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R.\nHickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification\nof these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the com-\npany, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as\nthe [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion,\narising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of\nVirginia, William Stith and John D.

The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to\nStiths History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company,\ncopied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of South-\nampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor\nByrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These volumes\nhappened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland,\u2019 whose\nlibrary I purchased, and with this they were sent tome. I gave notice of it to Mr.\nZane, but he never reclaimed them.\n\n\u2018* The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the\ncouncil. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin\nthe History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from\nthe council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he\nhad made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably\nunobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his\nexecutor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes were sent to me asa\npart of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being\nhandled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily\nopened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years.\u201d\n\n@\u00a5From the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825. >Col.

    "54": "44 INTRODUCTION\n\nCONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the \u2018\u2018 proceedings of the\nVirginia Company in England\u201d are the contemporary copies of the court book\nwhich were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the\nestate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or\nlater. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have\nbeen when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he\nmade a visit to England, that he made the purchase.* That the books remained\nin the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by\nthe fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the\nthird William Byrd, who died in 1777,? but these two volumes were not in the\nlibrary of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac\nZane. Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may\nbe accepted,\u00b0 but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when\nhe states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been\nreturned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that\nColonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contempo-\nrary copies of the court book in his Mistory of Virginia is apparent from his\ndescription of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated\nto him by the \u2018\u2018late worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq.\u201d\u00a2\n\nMANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III\n\nThe other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from\nMr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue,\nbelong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr.\nJefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of\nthe Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to\nMr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of\nVirginia, he describes in a similar way.\u00a2\n\n@ William Byrd died December 4, 1704.

Bassett.\n\n\u00a9 For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion,\npp. 78-84, post.\n\n@It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been\nacquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton\nRandolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by\nJustin Winsor.

    "55": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOOUMENTS, 1616-1634 45\n\nThat these are the papers discussed by Stith is proved by comparing them with\nthe Hickman (Bland) transcripts. In his preface, Stith confirms the description\nby Mr. Jefferson, but he apparently destroys the latter's theory that the papers\nhad been in the possession of Peyton Randolph since the death of Sir John Randol ph\nin 1736. Mr. Stith wrote his preface in 1746, and suggests that they were at that\ntime in the possession of the House of Burgesses, although he does not make a\npositive statement to that effect. His assertions are worth recording, since they\ncarry the history of the volumes back thirty years and also throw light on the\nHickman transcripts.\n\n\u2018*T must chiefly depend upon such of our Records, as are still extant. Many of\nthem doubtless perished in the State-house at James-Town, and by other Saaioms-\nand those, which have survived the Flames and Injuries of Time, have been <o care-\nlesly kept, are so broken, interrupted, and deficient, have been so mangled by Moths\nand Worms, and lie in such a confused and jumbled State (at least the most ancient\nof them) being huddled together in single Leaves and Sheets in Books out of the\nBinding, that I foresee, it will cost me infinite Pains and Labour, to reduce and\ndigest them in any tolerable Order, so as to form from them a just and connected\nNarration. And some of them have been lost, even since Mr. Hickman was Clerk of\nthe Secretary\u2019s Office. For I cannot find, among the Papers in our Offices, some old\nRolls, to which he refers. I have therefore been obliged, in a few Points, to depend\nupon the Fidelity of that Gentleman\u2019s Extracts out of our oldest Records, made for\nthe Use of Sir John Randolph. But these things were so far from discouraging and\nrebuffing me, that they were rather an additional Spur to my Industry. For |\nthought it highly necessary, before they were entirely lost and destroyed, to apply\nthem to their proper Use, the forming a good History. But as the House of\nBurgesses in a late Session, upon my shewing their moldering and dangerous State\nto some of the Members, have justly taken them into their Consideration, and have\nordered them to be reviewed and fairly transcribed, I doubt not, by their Assistance,\nand with the Help of the late Sir John Randolph\u2019s Papers, and such others, as are in\nthe Hands of private Gentlemen in the Country, and will undoubtedly be readily\ncommunicated to further so noble and so useful a Design, to be able to collect and\ncompose a tolerably regular and complete History of our Country.\"7\n\nHence, we are again left ina quandary. The papers may have come into Pevton\nRandolph\u2019s possession through the arrangement made by the burgesses for their\ntranscription; but no transcript made directly from the documents as late as 1745\nis known to us. Whether they were borrowed from the province by Mr. Stith or\nby Peyton Randolph, his brother-in-law, or hy some other historian or antiquarian\nis not yet proved; and our only evidence that Jefferson secured them from Peyton\nRandolphb\u2019s executor is his statement made twenty years after the date of the purchase.\n\n\u201cStith, History of Virginia, preface, p. vill.\n",

The order of contents of the volumes (while\nnot chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the\ndirection of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by\nthe early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts\nare original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them,\nby the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of\nthe period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province\nHouse was burned in Bacon\u2019s rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch\nin 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter\nhalf of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled\n\u2018\u2018Letters, proclamations in 1622-23, and correspondence 1625,\u201d is evidently the one\nreferred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as \u201c\u2018the other side of No.\nA 42.\u201d2 This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606-1692,\ncalled by Hening the \u2018Bland copy.\u201d In pages 1 to 14@ of this volume are eighteen\nletters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while\npages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and\nAugust 6, 1623. The first group are holographs, but of a secretary or clerk not yet\nidentified. The second are doubtless in the autograph of Edward Sharpless.\u201d Both\nare contemporary copies of the originals. The documents classed in the Jefferson\ncatalogue as 122 (42) form the balance of this volume and also probably include the\njournal of the council and assembly, 1626-1634.

The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive\nthrough the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623'4, when the assembly\nseems to have ceased.

That this is the original blotter of the court book of the gover-\nnor and council in Virginia, containing the original record of suits tried before that\nbody and of orders issued by it, is proved by the hasty and brief entries, giving the\nvolume an entirely different character from those of the carefully elaborated tran-\nscripts of the clerks. The records of twenty-three courts held as here given and of\nthe cases considered during the era of the authority of the company, consisting of\nabout forty-five pages of manuscript, are noted in the list of the records of the\ncompany, but are not printed in this collection since they may be included more\nproperly in a publication of the \u2018\u2018 Records of the Colony.\u201d\n\nTHE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS\nRANDOLPH COPY\n\nIt is now certain that at least two copies of the court book existed at the\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, since the so-called John Randolph [of Roanoke]\ncopy has recently come to light.

The\nother differences lie in occasional carelessness by the copyist and in the fact that\nthe abbreviations are expanded and the spelling and the capitalization are modernized.\n\nThe caption of the first volume of this eighteenth century copy is as follows:\n\u201cThe Ancient Records of this Colony under The Treasurer and Company.\u201d It\nopens with \u2018*A Quarter Court held for Virginia at Sir Thomas Smith\u2019s house in\n\n@ The three volumes are in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, but they\n\nare so closely associated with the Library of Congress MSS. that they are discussed here rather than\nunder the MSS. of Richmond.\n",

In this case also they would have been made from Mr.\nByrd\u2019s volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton\nRandolph library, but this would not account for the name \u2018*Cawson\u201d in the\nsecond volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of\nRoanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even\non friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since\nTheodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son\nof Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theo-\ndorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the\nproperty of his sister\u2019s son, John Randolph of Roanoke.\n\nThe location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph\nof Roancke is known.

Hugh Blair Grigsby examined\nthem at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is\nevident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate,\nthat the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands.\n\nThe later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington,\nD. C., as follows:\n\n\u2018**A complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the\npossession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge\nWilliam Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination\nof the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no\nshelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the\nbanks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it\ncould be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be\ndone. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by him-\nself. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the\nRandolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Vir-\nginia Historical Society, where it now is.\u201d \u00a2\n\nMr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press\ntwo volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A.\nBrock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled |trginza Company, 1619-1624.\nRobinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made\nthrough Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the\nRandolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him.\u2019\n\nThe third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and\nby Hening\u2018 as \u2018\u2018Ancient Records, Volume III,\u201d was copied from the transcript\nattested by R.

Mr. Hening speaks of three large folio volumes not\nin the orthography of the age of the events, and compiled without much regard to\nmethod for the purpose of forming material for a history of Virginia, and states\nthat the first two volumes are minutes of the proceedings of the London Company,\nand the third an epitome of the legislative and judicial acts of authorities in Vir-\nginia, so far as then extant, which were regularly transmitted to England. These,\nhe continues, were used by John Burk, who got them from John Randolph. and\nalso by Skelton Jones, 1809, to complete Burk\u2019s History of Virginia.\u00a2 Mr. Burk\nhimself declares that there are two large volumes, instead of three, as stated by\nHening, \u2018\u201c\u2018containing the minutes of the London Company together with the pro-\nceedings of the Virginia Councils and Assembly, with little interruption to the\nmiddle of the reign of George II.\u201d\n\nJEFFERSON TRANSCRIPTS\n\nThe three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia Records which came\nfrom the Jefferson Library in 1815 are unique, containing copies of records since\ndestroyed.

The writing of the volume is similar to the early seven-\nteenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double /, and the\nformation of some of the letters.

It thus possesses\nreproductions of all of the Virginia material in the British Museum, the Privy Council\noffice, the Bodleian Library, and the Magdalene College Library, Cambridge. In the\nPublic Record Office all docquet notices on Virginia, all records of suits in chancery\nand the admiralty pertaining to Virginia, and the guo warranty in the King\u2019s Bench,\nby which the company was dissolved, as well as the most important documents and\ncorrespondence, have been transcribed or photographed for the Library of Congress,\nbut the correspondence of the planters, the less important correspondence of the\ncompany, and mere memoranda are yet to be transcribed. The latter material is\nfairly outlined in the Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574 to 1660, and in\nthe Appendix of the eighth report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts,\nor is printed elsewhere in full.\u201c\n\nThe collection of publications by the company belonging to the Library of\nCongress is fairly good. It contains twelve of those which were issued before 1616,\nbut of the later books it has only three. The Declaration of 1620, the Declaration\nby Waterhouse in 1622, and John Donne\u2019s Sermon of the same year, in addition to\nSmith\u2019s General History, are the only ones of the eighteen now extant which are in\nthe Library.\n\nDOCUMENTS IN RICHMOND\n\nThe colonial records in Richmond, Virginia, relating to the period of the\ncompany are extremely few in number. Fortunately the original documents,\nwhich are in the Library of Congress, were borrowed or abstracted from the\nstate house in time to save them from destruction during the Revolution or by\nfire in 1865.\" There are, however, two volumes of original records in the Virginia\nState land office containing grants of land in 1623 and 1624, which were evidently\nentered by William Claybourne, at that time surveyor for the colony. The his-\ntory of contemporary documents before 1625, which are located in the district\nof the old settlement, may thus be briefly told.\n\nThe valuable collections of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond\nembrace the John Randolph of Roanoke transcripts described above, while the\nState library has three sets of transcripts and one set of abstracts from the British\nPublic Record Office.

In the Lenox branch\nof the New York Library is to be found a unique set of documents relating to the\nsettlement of Berkeley Hundred in 1619, known as the Smyth of Nibley papers\nwhich \u2018\u2018are from the collection of Virginia manuscripts originally brought together\nby John Smyth (or Smith) of Nibley, the historian of the Berkeleys, who was born\nin 1567 and died in 1641. The collection comprises over sixty papers, original and\ncontemporary transcripts, relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and\n1634. After passing into the hands of John Smyth the younger, and more recently\ninto the Cholmondeley collection at Condover Hall, Shropshire, the manuscripts\nwere offered for sale in January, 1888, by Mr. Bernard Quaritch, from whom\nthey were lately bought and given to the New York Public Library by Mr. Alex-\nander Maitland.\u201d* With the exception of the manuscripts in the Ferrar collection\nrelating to Smythe\u2019s Hundred, these form the only extant records of the important\nmovement for private plantations in Virginia under the r\u00e9gime of the company.\nTwo other valuable documents are now in the possession of the Lenox Library,\u2019 the\nholographic letter of John Pory, secretary of the colony, dated September 30, 1619,\nand Commissioner John Harvey\u2019s declaration of the State of Virginia in 1624.\n\nCOLLECTIONS OF AMERICANA\n\nThe manuscripts in the Library of Congress, the Smyth of Nibley papers in the\nNew York Public Library, and the patent books in Virginia are the only original\nrecords of the company or of the colony previous to 1625 now in America.

The copy of the 1620 declara-\ntion in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary\npamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has hereto-\nfore been noted.* It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch\nof supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of\nJune 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John\nBrinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox\nLibrary. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled Virginia\u2019s God\nbe Thanked,\u2019 with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the\nPequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there\nare copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition\nto these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing\n**The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622,\u201d and Observations to be followed for\nmaking of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including \u2018* A valuation of the commodi-\nties growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth,\u201d are to be found in\nthe Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox\nlibraries.\u00a9 In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by\nJohn Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Karl of Southampton,\nnow to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries.\n\nThe New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter\nBrown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains\ntwo unique publications of the company, the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620,\nwhich is the only copy known to the Editor. A catalogue of Bernard Quaritch, in\n\n\u00abThe other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of\nthe declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King\nand of the council; Patrick Copland\u2019s Virginia\u2019s God be Thanked, and his Declaration how the monies\nwere disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse\u2019s Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John\nDonne\u2019s Sermon, 1622.\n\n>There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress.\n\nc The Inconveniences\u2019\u2019 was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in\nthe Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London, A copy was in the\nCholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May,\n1887, This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition\nthat it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem\nvalid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page\nin that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted.\n",

In addition to twenty other\nrare publications of the company Mr. Ayer has a unique book entitled \u2018* Greevovs\nGrones for the Poore,\u201d 1621. It refers to the Virginia Company in its address\nonly, and in the statement of the number of poor that had been sent to Virginia,\nbut is of value for an understanding of that movement. The other private\ncollection is of about the same size. It contains the duplicate of the 1620\ndeclaration in the Lenox and the only known copy of \u00aba four-page tract entitled\n\u2018Declaration how the monies were disposed (being) collections for the Grammar\nSchooles,\u201d by Patrick Copland.\u00a2\n\n@In the catalogue of Bernard Quaritch for May, 1887, the broadside of May 17, 1620, and the\nNote of the Shipping, 1621, are both noted as being unique since each contains the final clause: \u2018\u2018 Who-\nsoever transports himself or any other at his own charge unto Virginia, shall for each person go trans-\nported before mid-summer, 1625, have to him and his heirs forever 50 acres of land upon a first\nand 50 acres upon a second division.\u201d\u2019 A copy of the Note of the Shipping, 1621, in the Cholmondeley\ncollection is similarly described in the fifth report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, page\n341. The Quaritch copies were sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch, whose collection went to Mr. Lefferts, and\nfinally through the dealers, Geo. H. Richmond or Dodd, Mead & Co., either to a private collection or\nto the Lenox Library. But the Lenox copies either do not correspond to these descriptions or were\nnot purchased from Mr. Lefferts. The volumes of the Lefferts collection, which were not gold in\nAmerica, were sent to Sotheby, England, but Mr. Eames of the New York Public Library states that\nno early Virginia material was allowed to return to England.\n\nb6The collection of Americana belonging to Mr. Ayer is open to the public through the\nNewberry Library. For the early Virginia material of the library see Index under \u2018\u2018Ayer,\nEdward.\u201d\n\n\u00a2This tract is described in the Appendix of the Fifth Report of the Historical Manuscripts\nCommission, as follows: \u2018\u2018A Declaration how the monies, viz., 70\", 8s. 6d., were disposed, which\nwas gathered (by Mr. Patrick Copland, preacher in the Royal James) at the Cape of Good Hope\n(toward the building of a free schoole in Virginia) of the gentlemen and mariners in the said\nship; a list of whose names are under specified, &c. 47 pp. Imprinted at London by F.

    "68": "58 INTRODUCTION\n\nTRANSCRIPTS IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\nOther attempts have been made to secure resources for research in America.\nNot only is there the aggregation of excerpts from the English documents in\nRichmond, us described above, and the acquisition of transcripts in the Library\nof Congress within recent years, but half a century ago a similar interest was\ndisplayed by collectors and historians in New York City, forming three collec-\ntions which are to-day in the Lenox Library.\n\nWilliam H. Aspinwall, a merchant, secured among other papers the Chalmers\ncollection of letters and documents relating to Virginia from 1606 to 1775. They\nwere in turn sold to Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, a lawyer and notable\ncollector of New York City, from whom a part were purchased by the library,\nwhile others came to the Lenox with the Bancroft transcripts in 1893. Chalmers\nhad been a clerk in the State paper office and seems to have taken these\nextracts, outlines, and sometimes full copies from the Plantation oflice papers,\nsince be continually refers to them in his Pol/t\u00e9culd Annals.\u00a2 They are modern-\nized transcripts, failing to follow the early orthography, abbreviations, and\ncapitalization. The writing is cramped and often almost illegible, while the\ntable of contents is incomplete and useless. They comprise (1) a series of brief\noutlines of Privy Council orders; (2) extracts from the Dudley-Carleton papers:\n(3) outlines of additional Council orders; (4) a calendar of certain of the colonial\nState papers; (5) outlines of council orders dealing with other trading companies.\nAll of the original documents are at present in the Public Record Office and are\nnoted in the Bibliographical List of Records following.\n\nThe Bancroft papers relating to Virginia and the Simancas Archives are well\nbound, clear, and apparently careful, correct, and full copies of the documents\nincluded. The first two volumes of the Bancroft collection bearing on the Virginia\nCompany are transcripts of many of the documents in the State paper office,\nprobably made in 1852 by Noel Sainsbury, but the list is not complete. While\nthe peculiar and characteristic signs of abbreviation are not followed, the orthog-\nraphy seems to be accurate throughout. Furthermore, the collection includes\nthe document entire, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents is carfeul\nand correct.\u201d The \u2018*Simancas Archives\u201d is a volume of transcripts of \u2018\u2018 Papers\nin the Simaneas Archives relating to the History of Virginia and other portions\n\n\u00abSee a statement by Victor H.

As the property of\nNicholas and John Ferrar, who were second only to Sir Edwin Sandys in their\nactivity in the company, it would be invaluable; but its importance is further\nenhanced by the fact that it contains the correspondence and papers of Sir Edwin\nSandys himself. These seventy-eight papers, which are either records of the\ncompany or vitally concern it, cover the period of the Sandys-Southampton influence\nfrom 1617 to the summer of 1623. They were the property of Dr. Peckard,\nmaster of Magdalene College in 1790, and were bequeathed to the college upon his\ndeath. It is probable that the greater part of the collection came from the Ferrar\nfamily through Dr. Peckard\u2019s wife, Martha Ferrar, the great granddaugher of\nJohn Ferrar, since the Virginia papers form but one-third of the group. The remain-\ning papers concern family affairs only, and date from 1601 to the middle of the\neighteenth century. Some of them are doubtless those received from the Earl of\nDorset by Dr. Peckard, when he was preparing his Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar.\u201d\n\nThe first knowledge of the Ferrar papers in later years was communicated to\nthe Virginia Magazine of History by Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Little Gidding, Ealing,\nEngland. He sent a number of transcripts and photographs of letters to the maga-\nzine for publication, among which were some half dozen bearing on the affairs of\nthe company, but the number which he was permitted to reproduce was limited\nby the college. While Mr. Ferrar was completing a history of the Ferrar family\nthe entire collection was deposited at his home, and it was therefore in Ealing in the\nfall of 1903 that the Editor was first permitted by the authorities of the college to\n\u2018*see and note the contents\u201d of the papers. Before the following summer Mr. Ferrar\nhad died and the collection had been returned to Cambridge. where complete trans-\ncripts of all letters and photographs of all documents relating to the Virginia\nCompany were made for the Library of Congress under the supervision of the\nEditor.\n\n@In this work Dr. Peckard states that the Earl of Dorset had had his library searched and\nhad sent him a few loose papers belonging to the Virginia Company.\n",
    "70": "60 INTRODUCTION\n\nThese papers are loose, many of them being much damaged, and it is apparent\nthat they are a part of a larger collection which must have been neglected while in\nthe possession of the family. There are some envelopes without letters, many\nrough memoranda by both Nicholas and John Ferrar, some account books, and some\nrough drafts of petitions to the House of Commons and of discussions on the\nsilkworm. The autographs which they furnish of both Nicholas and John Ferrar\nhave been of no little interest, as well as value, for the identification of other papers\nin the Public Record Office, and in the Library of Congress. Furthermore, the\nproof that Nicholas Ferrar himself supervised the transcript of the court book is\nthus gained.\n\nIn this collection are twenty-three papers which are veritable records of the\ncompany. Two documents give our only knowledge of the financial affairs of\nSmythe\u2019s Hundred, slight indeed, but from them comes additional information\nconcerning the system of organization of the societies for private adventure. Sundry\nother unique though scattered documents are among these papers, such as receipts\nfor money expended, showing the method of business, reports of committees, and of\nproceedings of the commissioners, revealing the bitterness of the factions, drafts or\noriginal records of certain courts, forming the only proof of the accuracy of the\ncopies of the court books, and three new proceedings of the courts of the Somers\nIslands Company. One of the latter is evidently a blotter and reveals the methods\nused in keeping the court book. The quo warranto in English, which was served\nupon the treasurer and company, would have been of the greatest value had not the\noriginal record of the suit in the King\u2019s Bench just been discovered. Another\ndocument of great value is the receipt referred to above, which proves that a court\nbook was regularly kept by the company from its very beginning. It reveals how\nmuch has been lost.\n\nThe series, consisting of twenty letters from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar,\nshows more clearly than any other documents we possess?\u2019 who the real managers of\nthe affairs were and what was the spirit of the Sandys faction. The absolute confidence\nwhich Sir Edwin Sandys had in John Ferrar and his great love for both of the brothers\nis significant. Moreover, the knowledge of the affairs of the company, the careful\nwatch over every act and movement affecting the business, the deep and earnest\nplans for the advancement of its interests revealed in these letters prove that Sir\nEdwin Sandys was the keen financial manager of the undertaking. It was evidently\nhe who determined what the policy should be; he was apparently the statesman\n\n@ List of Records, Nos. 76, 138, 164, 258, 259, 303, 304, 394, 421, 423, 470, 479, 539, 541, 543, and\nthe guo warranto.\n\n\u00bb For these letters see [bid., Nos. 120, 131, 135, 136, 171, 181, 191, 197, 211, 219, 271, 275, 282, 307,\n315, 316, 317, 364, 368.\n",

Much of the personal feeling\nand animosity that existed is here shown, and much also which reveals actual\nfinancial conditions.\n\nThe last group of these papers comprises thirty-five letters, all but one or two\nof which were written by planters or adventurers, resident in the colony, to Sir\nEdwin Sandys.* Of these, five came from Governor Yeardley, ten from either Jobn\nPory or George Thorpe, secretaries in the colony at different times, and two from\nthe cape merchant; of the remainder, at least ten are from colonists whose opinions\nand reports have not reached us in any other way. These letters are as full of\ncomplaint with regard to the insufficient supplies sent with new planters, as are the\nletters in the Manchester papers which Sir Nathaniel Rich and the Earl of Warwick\nused as a basis of accusation against the management of the company, but they\ndiffer from the other complaints in that they are kindly in spirit. Mr. Pory\u2019s letters\nare full of definite information concerning the affairs, needs, and hopes of the\ncolony, while Governor Yeardley also gives some valuable statements with regard to\nnew settlers, the council, the relations with the Indians, and the government of the\ncolony; both complain of the scant provisioning of the new settlers. The burden of\nthe Yeardley letters, however, is the investigation of the affairs of Captain Argall\nand the consequent criticism drawn upon himself from Lord Rich. Unfortunately,\ncomparatively few additional data are afforded concerning the Argall affair either by\nPory or by Yeardley. The planters themselves tell much of their condition and of\nthe districts in which they have settled, but the theme of their letters is most likely\nto be a demand for promised payments or a complaint as to the scarcity of provisions\nand clothes. The attitude toward Yeardley is generally favorable, John Rolfe alone\nsupporting Argall and criticizing the governor. As from all correspondence of\nsuch a character, new ideas are gained, new points of view, and often additional\nknowledge of relations with the Indians and with one another. Many of these\nletters are annotated by John Ferrar, revealing the degree of importance which he\nattached to their various and often conflicting statements.\n\nPUBLIC RECORD OFFICE\u2014MANCHESTER PAPERS\n\nA class of documents, very similar in character but of quite different spirit, is\nthe Manchester papers, now in the Public Record Office, London. Robert, Earl of\nWarwick, and his cousin, Sir Nathaniel Rich, were both members of the company.\n\n@For these letters, see List of Records, Nos. 93, 94, 115, 119, 134, 153, 156, 158, 166, 173, 179, 180,\n235, 238, 239, 241, 243-250, 252-255, 285, 343, 466.\n",
    "72": "62 INTRODUCTION\n\nSir Nathaniel was a leader in the Warwick faction, while Earl Robert, after the\ndissolution of the company in 1624, became a member of the council for Virginia.\nThe third wife of the Earl was Eleanor, Countess of Sussex, daughter of Richard\nWortley, and she, after the death of the Earl of Warwick, married, as her fourth\nhusband, Edward Montague, second Earl of Manchester. Thus it is that the\nKimbolton manuscripts, which are the records of the Duke of Manchester, contain\na large collection of petitions, declarations, memoranda, letters, and lists which\nemanated from the Warwick faction of the Virginia Company.* Many of these are\nholographs of Nathaniel Rich and Alderman Johnson, prime movers in that conflict.\nHenry Montague, Viscount Mandeville and later Earl of Manchester, was at one\ntime lord president of the Privy Council. Therefore many of the Manchester papers\nmay have belonged to him. The autographs, however, identify those which concern\nthe Virginia Company as having belonged to Nathaniel Rich.\n\nThe Manchester and the Ferrar papers therefore present the two sides of this\nconflict, not in open court or even in private contest, but in the private documents\nand memoranda of the leaders. The collections are of about the same size, there\nbeing sixty-six papers in the Manchester series, to seventy-eight in the Ferrar group.\nThese, also, are unbound, but since the greater part are rough notes of documents,\nor drafts of propositions or speeches, they are much more difficult to decipher than\nthe Ferrar papers. Indeed many of them are almost illegible, and not a few are\nunintelligible, having no connecting thought.\n\nA dozen of these papers may be considered documentary; that is, rough copies\nof letters, petitions, and declarations, or of acts of the company, or of its members\nand officers in an official capacity. A few of these only are to be found among the\nother records of the company. Like the rest of the set, they, almost without\nexception, concern the accusations against the Sandys-Southampton management.\nThree of them are petitions or letters concerning the extent of the tobacco trade,\nbut the rest are petitions to the King against one faction or the other, and answers\nto those petitions. Of these, one of the most important is a copy of the opinion\nof counsel concerning the powers conferred on the Virginia Company by the\nseveral letters patent.? Accusation and defense are set forth in these documents,\nbut the headings of speeches, the drafts of propositions, and the notes from docu-\nments on which the arguments are based proclaim the motives and methods of the\naccusers. No proof could be clearer than these memoranda by Alderman Johnson\nand Nathaniel Rich that the company was to be overthrown by fair means or foul.\nIn two or three papers are carefully prepared lists of alleged evil deeds of Sir\n\n\u00abThese Manchester papers are calendared by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts,\n\nReport VIII, Part 2.\nb List of Records, p. 140, No. 170.\n",

Many of the rough notes of both Johnson\nand Rich furnish the only source of information concerning the directions given\nto the commissioners appointed by the Crown to investigate the condition of the\ncompany and of the colony and their acts and reports, but a fact of greater sig-\nnificance is this, that the Warwick collection contains a dozen rough drafts of\ndirections to those commissioners, of charges against the company to be sent to\nthat body, of preliminary reports concerning the government of Virginia, and of\nprojects for the settlement of the government and the colony. The source of the\nschism is here revealed, and the accusation by Sandys that accuser and judge were\none is justified.\u201d\nCOLONIAL AND DOMESTIC STATE PAPERS\n\nThe other large group of Virginia records, consisting of over one hundred\nand twenty separate documents, is found among the colonial and domestic papers\ndeposited in the Public Record Office. The source of this collection is uncertain.\nMuch of it came from the Plantation Office, and perhaps from the Privy Council\nOffice. The consolidation of depositories took place in 1578, but the efforts of\nDr. Thomas Wilson, the first clerk of the papers, to force the previous and\nincumbent magistrates to hand over all documents to the State, were evidently\noften unavailing, and hence it was that the creation of a State Paper Ottice was\nnot really accomplished until the period of the company. After Sir Thomas\nWilson succeeded his uncle during the reign of James I the aid of the King was\nmuch relied upon, and, though partially successful, the recent revelation of quasi-\npublic documents in private collections shows that not only earlier but later\nofficials considered papers of record private property.\u00a9 Thus some of the Salis-\n\n@ List of Records, No. 438.\n\n5A letter from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar, cited in the List of Records, No. 317.\n\n\u00a2Scargill-Bird, 4 Guide to the Documents in the Public Record Office, Introduction, p. xxxvi.

Similarly, the Cottonian papers in the Museum\noriginally belonged to Sir Robert Cotton in the time of James I.\n\nAmong the State Papers deposited in the Record Office are the letters to\nJohn Ferrar, dated from Virginia in April, 1623, which may have been seized by\nthe commission appointed on May 9, 1623, to investigate the affairs of the com-\npany. There, too, are found the attested copies of letters and records in the\ncolony which concern the Harvey Commission, sent to the commission in England\nby Edward Sharpless. A few of these papers seem to have belonged to the\ncompany, such as the documents pertaining to the Walloons and dated 1621;\nPory\u2019s report from Virginia, in the same year; and two copies of documents by\nCollingwood, dated the latter part of 1623.7 All of these facts lead to the con-\nclusion that a part of the records of the commissions, and a part of the confis-\ncated records of the company are here deposited. If so, where are the remainder\nof these most valuable documents? ?\n\nThe colonial papers and the domestic correspondence include about forty-eight\nwhich are records, and about nineteen which are documentary in character.\nThe first group contains, among other papers, many of the petitions and letters\naddressed to the King and to the Privy Council, and many others of the council. It\nis thus apparent that the royal correspondence of the Privy Council and the Privy\nCouncil papers which should accompany the register are in this collection. To the\nsecond group belong those papers which contain projects presented by individuals and\nanswers to such propositions, lists of adventures for the company, and also lists\nof men sent to the colony and of lands granted in Virginia. Among these papers\nare seven letters from colonists, in addition to about fifty which may be consid-\nered subsidiary correspondence in that they refer incidentally to the affairs of\nthe company. Such are the Mandeville-Conway, Middlesex-Conway, Chamberlain-\nCarleton, Conway-Calvert, and Nethersole-Carleton letters.\n\nRECORDS OF COURTS\n\nIn the libels of the admiralty court, instance and prize, are found records of\nsuits in which the Virginia Company is plaintiff.

Among the other formal material of the suit against Wye are two valuable\ndocuments, namely, the commission given to Wye and a letter from the treasurer\nand council to Sir George Yeardley, dated June 21, 1619. In the latter are valuable\nreferences to Argall, and the complaints against Wye, though torn and illegible,\nreveal something of the loss estimated as resulting from the failure to settle the\npassengers in Virginia.

In the colonial entry\nbooks and among the proclamations of the King are orders of the Privy Council\nand of the King, all of which are recorded in the Privy Council register.\n\nPRIVY COUNCIL REGISTER\n\nSince the Privy Council took no direct part in the affairs of the company\nbetween 1617 and the summer of 1622, its orders related to those regulations which\nwould enable the acts of the company to advance the interests of the kingdom, leaving\nabsolute power to the company as the proprietor. Thus fully one-half of its thirty\nmeasures during those five years were reprieves of prisoners, with the warrants nec-\nessary to send them to Virginia or orders enabling children to be transferred from\nthe cities of the kingdom to the colony. During this period the Crown commenced\nits attempts to secure a revenue from the tobacco trade, and a series of orders finally\nresulted in the approval of the contract with the company in February of 1622 3.\nIn its foreign and external relations the company was of course subject to the action\nof the Privy Council, and hence the orders in council concerned the contest with\nSpain over the attack of the 7reasurer. Furthermore, the disagreement with the\nnorthern colony concerning fishing privileges had to be adjusted by the council and\nresulted in the renewal of the patent to the northern colony and in regulations as\nto rights of fishing. It was in the summer of 1622 that the first movement was\nmade which brought the difficulties between the factions into the open board.\nThe petition of John Bargrave against Sir Thomas Smythe, Alderman Johnson,\nand others, in which they were accused of mismanagement, resulted in the defeat of\nBargrave six months later, as was to have been expected from the hostility of the\nCrown to the party in Parliament led by Sir Edwin Sandys, of which Bargrave\nwas evidently a member at that time. But the storm broke in the following April,\nwhen the commission was appointed to inquire into the true state of the Virginia\nand Somers Islands companies. From that date until the dissolution of the com-\npany in the summer of 1624 the council busied itself with the affairs of the company.\nNo less than 31 orders are recorded which create commissions and empower them\nto investigate both the colony and the company and in the end to assume the\nfunctions of government in the name of the Crown, while seven of these documents\npass directly between the council and the colony, and no other measures were con-\nsidered except those which enabled the Warwick faction to tear down the work of\nthe adventurers and to take into its own hands the control of the entire business.\nThese forms of government, planned by the Crown and the commissions here\nrecorded, by which the authority was vested in the commissioners and later in a\ncommittee of the Privy Council, stand for the beginning of royal control.

Che Records of the Company under the\nSandys-Southampton Administration\n\nORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY\n\nIn order to comprehend what the records of the company were and what their\nvalue, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the system which the corporation\nworked out in order to further its purposes. The forms and usages of the company\nafter 1619 were determined by the charters granted by the King and by the \u2018* Orders\nand Constitutions\u201d which it adopted in 1619 and printed in June, 1620,\u00a2 although the\nlatter were altered or newly interpreted from time to time by action of its courts.\n\nThe membership of the company was unlimited and was granted by the courts\nto anyone who had \u2018\u201c\u2018adventured\u201d \u00a312 10s. for a share of stock or to whom the com-\npany had awarded a share of stock for services.\u2019 The distinction between a member\nwho was free of the company and an owner of Jand in Virginia was brought out in a\ncontroversy on February 19, 1622 3, in which a proposition to limit the adventurers\nto those approved by the generality met with opposition on the ground that land in\nVirginia was held in free and common socage and could not be forbidden to any man.\nBut Sir John Brooke, the legal authority in the company, declared that such exclusion\nwas agreeable to the law since it was a question of a vote ina court and nota ques-\ntion of ownership of land. The argument was based on the power to withhold the\nprivilege of voting from Samuel Wrotb, who was under censure, and similarly on\nthe power to exclude any man who had purchased land from a member who was\nindebted to the company until the debts were paid. This discussion also revealed\nthat no oath of fidelity was required in the Virginia Company as in the Muscovy\nand other corporations. Ata later date the King proposed that no member should\nbe free of the courts who had not sent men to the colony as planters, claiming that\nless than thirty of the adventurers could meet the requirement.\u2018 The power to dis-\nfranchise an unworthy member was reserved to the company.\n\naList of Records, No 183.\n+ MS.

On the Monday preceding they assembled in a prepar-\native court and on every Wednesday fortnight thereafter in a common or ordinary\ncourt, as required by the charter of 1612; and they might also be summoned to\nan extraordinary court by the treasurer or deputy. The meetings were held in the\nprivate houses of various members of the company\u201c until the time of the tobacco\ncontract, when a company house was established.\n\nIn the quarter court the adventurers elected all councilors and principal officers\nof the company and colony, made all laws and ordinances, confirmed all grants of\nland, settled all questions of trade, and passed all measures which should bind the\ncompany for a termof years. Their action with regard to questions of a new charter\nand of investment for the colony was legal only when transacted in a quarter court,\nbut they might transfer to other courts actions which concerned correspondence\nwith the lord treasurer or similar business. Fifteen of the generality and five\nof the council formed a quorum for the ordinary courts, and in those they signed\nwarrants, ordered the payment of bills passed by the auditors, and sealed bills of\nadventure. In that meeting also were perfected commissions for transportation\nof men and provisions and for trade and barter. Special officers and committees\nwere appointed in this court, and even actions of great importance, such as the\ndissolution of the magazine or the extension of freedom of the company to hon-\norary members, were consummated.\u2019\n\nThe officers chosen by the company were a council, a treasurer, a deputy,\nauditors, a general committee of sixteen, a secretary, a bookkeeper, a hushand, and\na beadle.

But the practice in the courts was to\nrefer to it those difficult duties for which its titled and distinguished personnel made\nit especially fit.

This record was to consist of the name, age, country,\nprofession, and kindred of each individual and was to state at whose charge the\ntransportation was effected.

The facts set forth by the latter were taken from\nthe \u2018\u2018 Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar\u201d by his brother John, about 1654, and therefore\nthis work may be considered as based on contemporary authority. According to\nDr. Peckard, Nicholas Ferrar, knowing that malice was at work, procured a\nclerk to copy out all the court books and other writings and caused them to be\ncarefully collated with the original. It cost him the sum of \u00a350, which he thought\nwas the best service he could render the company. After the seizure of all the\nmuniments of the company, and after Lord Treasurer Middlesex had procured\nsentence against the company, Mr. Ferrar informed Sir Edward Sandys and others\nof what he had done. These men were greatly rejoiced and advised that the copies\nbe taken to the Earl of Southampton, who was so overcome that he is said to have\nembraced Mr. Ferrar and to have declared that he valued them as an evidence of his\nhonor more than as evidences of his land. John Ferrar is quoted as having stated\nthat the Earl of Southampton was advised not to keep these records in his house\nand so delivered them to Sir Robert Killigrew, who left them on his death to Sir\nEdward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset. Mr. Ferrar continues that the Earl of Dor-\nset died in 165%, but he hopes the records are still in the possession of the Earl\u2019s\nfamily. ?\n\nCertain it is that Dr. Peckard had a large collection of manuscripts which\nconcerned the Virginia Company, some of which must be considered a part of the\nrecords of the company, for such were the Ferrar papers described above which\nDr, Peckard bequeathed to Magdalene College, Cambridge. That some of them, at\nleast, came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family is to be concluded from the statement\nof Dr. Peckard that the \u2018\u2018 Duke had had his library searched and found a few loose\npapers, which he sent to him.\u201d* Some of them doubtless belonged to Dr. Peckard\u2019s\n\n\u00abThis pamphlet is in the volume entitled: Copy of a Petition from The Governor and Company of the\nSommer Islands, with Annexed Papers, presented to the Right Honorable The Councel of State July the 19th,\n1651, London, Printed for Edward Husband, 1651.\n\n+ Peckard, pp. 155-156.\n\u00a2See discussion of the Ferrar papers, pp. 59 ff., ante.\n",

But the story of the purchase of the two volumes from the\nestate of the Duke of Southampton by Colonel William Byrd in 1673 or 1688 for\n60 guineas has firm credence through statements of Mr. Byrd himself; and there\nis no evidence that they came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family. That they were\nsent to Tichfield by the Earl of Southampton before he sailed for the Netherlands\nand there remained until his son\u2019s library was sold after his death in 1667 seems\nprobable. Perhaps some of the other records went to Sir Robert Killigrew, as\nstated by John Ferrar, and even some from which these copies were made.\n\nThe statement by Woodnoth, who was a nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, that Sir\nJohn Danvers had the transcripts of the records made in order to keep out of\nthe way an indigent man who had been employed by the company as a copyist\nand who might be persuaded to say something ill of Sandys and of Nouthampton.,\ndoes not bear the stamp of truth or even of probability.

The rest\nof the insertion is usually by his assistant, who was perhaps Thomas Collett, his\nnephew. All of the insertions in the first volume and about twenty in the second\nare entirely in the so-called Collett autograph, numbering about the same as those\nsuperintended by the deputy himself. The way in which these insertions are often\ncrowded in, is evidence that they were copied from the original documents in spaces\nleft for the purpose by the hired copyist.\u00b0\n\nAs to the identity of the other three or four distinct autographs, in which\nthe remaining part of the volumes appear, nothing has been determined. The\nfirst and third copyists are distinctly different in style, while what appears as\nthe writing of a fourth and a sixth clerk may possibly be identical with that of\nthe first. With the exception of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar, the whole is\nclearly, carefully, and legibly written in the characteristic running hand of the\nperiod, resembling the chancery hand. The spelling, capitalization, and abbrevia-\ntions are distinctive and characteristic of each copyist. The use of curved lines\nto complete blank spaces at the end of the line, and often at the bottom and top of\nthe page, shows the labor expended to make the transcript accurate and complete.\nThe memoranda at the end of the volumes declare that the transcript had been\ncarefully collated with the original \u2018\u2018courte booke\u201d and with the authentic docu-\nments by the secretaries, Edward Waterhouse and Edward Collingwood, in the\nfirst volume, and by Thomas Collett and Edward Collingwood in the second.

Even the omission of one or\ntwo lines in the Ferrar copy, later corrected, can be accounted for by reference to\nthese sheets, since in each case it has resulted from the same word occurring in the\nsame place on two successive lines. Furthermore, the directions in the margin of\nthese courts as to where certain documents were to be entered were followed in the\ntranscript and seem to point to these as a part of the original minutes. The\nautograph of the court held on June 25 is identical with that of the first copyist\nof the transcript, while the courts of July 4and July 9 were apparently written by\nthe sixth copyist of the transcript. Among the Ferrar papers are two drafts of a\nresolution concerning the \u2018\u2018 Lo T\u00e9er speach touching M* Alderm. Johnson,\u201d which\nwas entered in the court book. One is a rough draft written, altered, and corrected\nby Edward Collingwood, and bearing the above indorsement by the writer and a\nsimilar indorsement by John Ferrar. The other draft is in the autograph of the\nsixth copyist of the court book, following the above, and is attested hy Edward\nCollingwood. The transcript in the court book is identical with the latter, but\nthe vote is omitted; the substance, however, is given after the discussion follow-\n\n\u00abFor the evidence that the corrections are by Edward Collingwood, compare the autographs\nas shown in the plates of Vol. II, post.\n\n5 Signatures of Edward Collingwood may also be found in the Publie Record Office among\nthe State Papers Colonial, II, Nos. 10-11, 13, 19 (II, II]).

Thus they seem rather to have been drafts\nof a resolution which had been presented than of one prepared to be offered.\nComparison between these records of courts and a draft of a Somers Islands court,\nin the same collection, leads to the conclusion that they do not forma part of the\nblotter or blurred book from which the original book was made, since the latter\nare much corrected and altered and then canceled diagonally from corner to corner;\u00a2\nbut are rather a part of the original book itself. The reliability of the Library of\nCongress transcripts is also confirmed by collating them with the original documents,\nor with other copies of the documents, which are inserted in the court book, and these\ncareful comparisons have shown how accurately Edward Collingwood and _ his\nassistants conducted the work for Nicholas Ferrar.?\n\nTHE SYSTEM OF KEEPING THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe system by which the minutes of the courts were kept is thus outlined in\nthe minutes; the court book was first drawn up by the secretary, was approved by\nthe deputy, and later accepted or corrected by the court.\u00b0 That there must have\nexisted a \u2018\u2018Blurr booke\u201d in addition to the various reports or other documents\noffered in any court is proved by an extract from a memorandum by Sir Nathaniel\nRich, which is a warrant requiring all records of the court to be brought to the\ncommissioners on Virginia, and includes the \u2018\u2018Court Bookes w\u00ae\u2122 should warrant\nthe sd Record*, and the Blurr bookes w\u00ae should warrant the Court Booke and\nis the first ground of the Record*; that it may [be] discouered whether there be\nany difference betweene them.\u201d\u00a2 The entries in the court book are the minutes\nof all the various courts, of several meetings of the Somers Islands Company,\nand of one meeting of the committees.\n\nIntroducing each court is a list of the adventurers in attendance. A comparison\nof the number with the number of votes cast as recorded shows that these are\nquite complete for the quarter courts, but in the ordinary courts either the\nattendance was very small or the entry was incomplete, since the list is often\nterminated with the expression \u2018\u2018and divers others.\u201d It was sometimes entered\nlater than the transcript of the body of the text, as though from a book of\nattendance, but no mention of a roll book is found among the records. This part\nof the book alone furnishes a valuable comment upon the social classes interested\nin the undertaking and from it may be gained a knowledge of the faithfulness\n\n@ Post, Plates in Vol. II.\nb\u00a5For any variations of importance, see footnotes to documents in the \u2018\u2018Court Book,\u2019\u2019 post, I, II.\n\n\u00a2Court Book, I, Dec. 11, 1622.\n@List of Records, No. 465.\n",

The approval of the\nprevious court is usually recorded first, although many times this is deferred until\nthe quarter court; then follows the report of the treasurer, through which the\nimportant matters to be determined are presented to the court, and the hearing of\npetitions, passing of shares, and grants of land appear at the end of the session.\n\nIn the ordinary courts were propounded all of those matters which did not\nrequire action in the general court and often many measures for preliminary dis-\ncussion which were postponed for final action to the fuller court. Thus the records\nof the common courts and also of the preparative courts usually contain the full\nreports and discussions of the various subjects, while the statements in the quarter\ncourts are brief and perfunctory, embodying the decisions reached in the lesser\ncourts. The reports of officers, from which so much concerning the financial status\nis to be learned, are entered in the minutes of the general court. To trace the course\nof any question necessitates a search through all of the courts, but in the quarter\ncourts will be found the elections and the final action on all laws and ordinances, on\nthe patents for private plantations or monopolies, or, in short, on all measures by\nwhich the company would be bound for a term of years.\n\nCONTENTS OF THE COURT BOOK\n\nThe business recorded during the first two years of the Sandys administration\nconcerned the establishment of laws and orders in the company and in the colony,\nthe systematizing of methods, the formation of joint stock companies for the erection\nof new industries in Virginia, and the opening up of new adventures. But after the\nmassacre early in the year 1622, the whole tone of the book changes. Personal feuds\nand quarrels, complaints, and accusations fill the pages. Whether the friction was\ndue to the extreme distress brought about by the attack of the Indians or whether it\nwas but the excuse for open opposition by the party of the Crown, which had been\nrapidly developing, is difficult to determine. From the spring of 1622 until\nFebruary, 1622/3, the burden of the record concerns the tohecco contract with the\nCrown. It resulted in the discussion of salaries for the officers and the quarrel\nwith Samuel Wroth, which occupied the attention of the company for three mouths.\nThen followed the Butler and Johnson accusations, the investigation by the Crown,\nand the dissolution of the company. It is literally true that, after June, 1622, no\nnew measures for trade, for industry, or for commerce are entered in the court book.\nThere was the usual transferring of shares and hearing of petitions and claims, but\nthe business activity was evidently destroyed. That the colony could survive the\n",

A list of all of the ships departing or arriving\nwith the names of the masters could thus be drawn up, but the terms of the\ncharter party could not be determined.* A full statement of the shares of stock\ngranted or transferred, of the land assigned for adventure or for service, and of the\nprivate plantations erected could be given. Even a partial financial account could\nbe rendered, though not an itemized statement. The larger sums invested or\nreceived from the various sources are usually given in the treasurer\u2019s plans and the\nofficers\u2019 reports, although unfortunately only those of the treasurer and deputy are\nentered in full. But from scattered statements in plans, reports, and discussions,\nfrom grants, patents, suits, letters, petitions, and claims will come much that will\nilluminate the financial situation when these are gathered together.\n\nThe full record of all documents for which record was not provided elsewhere\nwas made in the court book. Plans, reports of committees, and reports of chief\nofficers seem to have been entered in full, but letters to and from the colony, and to\nand from the privy council, petitions with the action thereupon, charter parties,\ngrants for monopolies, lists of departing planters, expenditures and receipts of the\nmagazines, and rolls of adventure, were all recorded in the other books provided by\nthe \u2018\u2018 Orders and Constitutions\u201d or in the books created later. A single illustration\nwill suffice. Of the twenty-seven letters sent to the colony and received from the\ncolony, copies of many of which have been found among the papers in Virginia, but\nfifteen are mentioned in the court book, and only a few are spread in full upon the\nminutes. A great many more documents are entered in the court book during the\nlater years, due evidently to the desire to keep a record of the controversy which\nmight serve as a defense against the accusations of the malcontents. That many of\nthese were not entered in the original court book is revealed by the marginal notes\nin the extant court minutes of the Ferrar papers, which read as follows: \u2018\u2018 Enter the\nquietus est,\u201d \u2018\u2018Enter the resolution,\u201d and other similar directions.\n\nThe court book is not only a source of information, but it also serves as a guide\nto the other records of the company. That all of the twenty-one documents men-\ntioned but not entered in the court book have been found in other collections is\nmost important and interesting.

There are thirteen documents entered in the\ncourt book which are on record elsewhere, consisting of declarations or reports which\nwere published by the company, petitions and letters to the King, and orders of the\n\u201c King\u2019s council. But thirty most valuable documents are spread upon the minutes\nwhich have not yet been discovered among other papers. These include a few peti-\ntions to the King, many petitions received by the company, a number of letters from\nand to the colony, the propositions brought forward in the attempt to form a tobacco\ncontract with the King, the plans propounded by the treasurer for the advancement\nof the enterprise, and the declarations of the state of the affairs of the company and\nof the colony by the same officer. \u00a2\n\nTHE EXTANT SUPPLEMENTARY RECORDS\nDOCUMENTS OUTLINING THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY\n\nThe organization and the method of procedure of the company have been\noutlined, in order to enable the reader to comprehend the nature of the records, and\nthrough them the machinery by which it conducted its internal affairs; but there is a\nwider and more important field to consider. The real interest in the company comes\nfrom its activity in carrying on trade and in developing the resources and\ngovernment of the colony. Again, the starting point must be the court hook, not\nonly as a guide to the records which it kept in executing its purposes, but in\ndiscovering what activities are to be traced. Two kinds of documents afford the\nclearest outline of the subject; in one are the reports which the treasurer offered to\nthe company and which are spread upon the minutes; in the other are the printed\ndeclarations and broadsides which the company issued for the purpose of securing\ninterest, confidence, and investment in the undertaking. With the same motive it\nreprinted treatises and published sermons which had been delivered before the\ncompany.\n\nThe first report of Sir Edwin Sandys after he became treasurer was offered\non November 3, 1619, in which he thus defined his policy: The resources of the\ncompany were to be augmented by settling and developing the company\u2019s land and\nby increasing the number of industries to be established, an action which must\nadvance the plantation from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement.\nThe report begins with a statement of the number of men which had been transported\n\n@All of these documents, whether entered in the court book or not, are cited in the List o:\nRecords, and are also referred to by foot notes in this edition of the court book.\n",

The other measures discussed are indicative\nof the development which rapidly took place. First of these was the effort to\nestablish other commodities in Virginia and restrain the excessive production of\ntobacco; the second was the encouragement of a spirit of local patriotism in the\ncolony. The treasurer urges that men should be sent from the low countries to\nraise fortifications for the colony, stating that the colonists were willing to bear the\ncharges of the work since they had recently been encouraged by the charters and\ngrants of liberties. The dependence of the company upon the lotteries for an\nincome and the care to arrange for an economical transportation of the men are\nindications of the financial policy and status of the colony. The income of the\nlottery is estimated at \u00a33,500, and the total expense of perfecting the plan submitted\nis placed at \u00a34,000 or \u00a35,000.\n\nSix months later the treasurer made his annual report, which revealed to what\nextent his plans had been executed. It was issued as a broadside under the date of\nthe court in which it was delivered and describes the state of the colony from April,\n1618, to April, 1619, taken from a general letter to the company, and then proceeds to\noutline the successful activity of the colony during the succeeding year. It empha-\nsizes the erection of private plantations, the number of men sent to the company\u2019s\nland, the commodities provided for\u2014there being ten instead of two as in the former\nyear-\u2014the interest in the care of religion and education in the colony, and the stable\nfinancial condition of the company. The general receipts amounted to \u00a39,831 14s 11d\nand the disbursements were \u00a310,431 14s U7d, but the surplus in the college fund more\nthan exceeded this deficiency, the receipts from that source being \u00a32,043 02s 114d and\nthe expenditures \u00a31,477 15s 5d. The lottery was reported to have an increase in stock\nover the previous year of \u00a31,200. Although not re-elected treasurer, the financial\nmanagement remained in the hands of Sir Edwin Sandys, as is proved by the entries\nof his plans in the court book and by his private letters to John Ferrar. A scheme\noutlined in the court of July 7, 1620, is practically the measure put forth in the\nprinted declaration of June 22, 1620, and proposes a continuation of the policy stated\nabove.\n\nThe printed documents of 1619 and 1620 add but little to the plans revealed in the\ntreasurer\u2019s reports concerning the activity of the company, although the measures\ntaken to advance the comfort of the planters and of the tenants upon arrival in\nVirginia, the establishment of many private plantations, and the encouragement\ngiven to the self-government of the colony are brought out more clearly. After the\nnote of the shipping in 1621, so far as is known, there were no propositions issued\n",

This was due to the massacre which paralyzed the efforts of the\ncompany for a time and forced upon it publications of defense and excuse or\ndirections of warning. While the company was torn by dissension, after 1622 the\ncolony slowly but steadily advanced. The proprietor was no longer active, and the\ncenter of interest is therefore transferred from the courts in London in which the\nplans had been conceived to the settlenient in which they were maturing.\n\nThe various publications of the company afford not only an understanding of the\nmeasures proposed, but also of their execution. They were in themselves a means of\ncarrying out its schemes. Before 1622 five of these advertisements were issued by\nthe company. The broadside bearing the date May 17, 1620, is a full statement of\nthe prosperous condition in the colony, setting forth the ability of the colony to\nreceive newcomers in its guest houses, newly built in each of the four ancient\nboroughs and in the other plantations, and describing the measures provided to sus-\ntain ministers in cach borough. It states the number of men who had been sent to\nthe public land, with the provisions allowed, and describes fully the efforts which\nhad been made to establish six industries in the colony.\u00a2\n\nA book of great importance was issued by the company in June of the same\nyear containing a series of declarations.\u201d There were at least two editions in the\nyear 1620, having variations in the title page; in the first edition the pages are\nnumbered according to each pamphlet and the imprint is \u2018*T. $.,\u201d while in the\nsecond the pagination is consecutive from 1 to 92 and the imprint is that of Thomas\nSnodham. The latter varies also in the orthography of the word \u2018\u2018 colony\u201d in the title.\nThe former was probably the first edition and was composed of pamphlets, each of\nwhich may have been issued separately, and seems to have been reissued, with an\nadditional pamphlet concerning a division of land in Virginia,\u2018 in which the\nsignature is consecutive. Copies of the first issue of the first edition of the ** Decla-\nrations\u201d are in the Harvard Library and in the New York Public Library (*' No.\n1\u201d), but the only copy of the second issue is in the John Carter Brown Library\n(copy \u2018tA\u201d).
