Expedition will nowe bee the life of it, That it may be putt into accion, hy Bartholmew day, else this yeare will bee lost as the last yeare was; your Lordship hath tendered the importacion of the Spanish Tobacco to the Companie, they (as they doe all thinges els) applie it to the benefitt of a few, for want of a Stock. Tmake noe doubt but if this Commission be expediated, but there wilbe a Stock procured time enough to farme the Tobacco for the publique soe as the benefitt gayned shall returne to the good of the Kinge, and the plantacion. Good my Lord in all your grauntes that carrie profitt with them, use the name of the Publique; The word Companie governed by populer voices, is it that covereth all their scerett practises. And it is a shame that the Common weale of Virginia, dependinge on the Monarchie here, should be governed soe, as this little treatise here inclosed will show you. All the examples that I produce to expresse the injuries done, were for the most part in Sir Thomas Smith's goverment, because from it the planters have learned their inhumenitie and injustice which they nowe use, both against the new comers and adventurers, offeringe the same measure which hath bene measured before to them. But if I should call in question the present governors, whoe beinge not ignorant that the populer goverment doth dircetlie take away the power of the monarchie and shew what mischeife they have done by their profuse throwinge out libertie, amongst the planters, whereby they have made them forsake their former discipline, strength and vertue to defend themselves against the domestick enemie, and yet beinge fore warned of these thinges it should appeare that they did it knoweingely and wittinglic against the soveraignitie in England, extreame libertie beinge worse then extreame Tirranie, as it appeared by the troubles  ' From the text printed in the American Historical Review, XXVIII, pp. 508-809,  LESA0T\u201435 \u2014- 16 ",
