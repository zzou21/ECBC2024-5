M\u2019 Brooke said that somethinge of necessity must be donn for the hono\u2019 of this Court w had bin much scandalized by m*\u2122 Wrote as for m\u2019* Wrots appeale to a Quarter Court he said, it was rather an Appeale from the Quarter Court by Spinninge out the time: And whereas m\u2018 Wrote moued for liberty to appointe some to take deposi\u00e9ons of Witt- nesses on his behalfe he held his mo\u00e9on to be verie inconvenient and vnfitt, for neither could any but the Deputy and Secretary take the deposi@ons, and besid\u20ac such manner of proceeding\u20ac would cause a number of great inconveniences that would neuer haue an end, and wished m\u2019 Wrote to be better aduised in his speeches, and not seeke thereby to abuse mens iudgements for whereas he said the proceeding\u20ac of the Parliament vpon an offender was no president for an Inferio\u2019 Court, he said, the greater Court is, the better president; and that an affront euen to the Court of Pipowder is lyable to censure and pun- ishment, and therefore much more to so Hono\u201d a Court as this was.  The Ea: of Southampton said that m* Wrote ought not toteach them howe to iudge, but willed him to hold to the buissines in hand and to declare whither his word were truely sett downe in that Co\u2122 [123] or no sayinge he had beguii well and should proceed on still in the same manner to declare the rest of the omissions and his other excep-  ",

M\u2019 Herbert said that it was to be considered whither they will by Wittnesses or by the whole Court then present examine whither the said Courts be truely or falsely sett downe w\u2122 he conceaued was most fittly to be donn by those that were then present  M* Lawrence Hide said that the Custome of the Court is the lawe of the Court and finde m* Wrote haue erred exceedingly against it, and cannot excuse him of folly that he moues frem \u00a7for\u00a7 flyinge from the Court, and therefore admonished him to confesse his erro\u2019 and if he refuse, he feares he hath some worse end\u00a2 in this course he hold@.

At length for rectifyinge the Court and for makinge this a leadinge President, it was proposed whither the Cempany Court would admit of any exafiina\u00e9on of Wittnesses vpon oath and such other courses as m\u2019 Wrote desired for Tryall of this buissines or noe, or whither they would trye it by the testimony of them that were present w\u2122 beinge  ",

My lo: of Southampton propounded that for the better proceedinge in this buissines the Court might be first read wholly ouer and after- ward examined by part\u20ac w\u2122 was agreed vnto.  M\u2019 Wrote demaunded whither this meetinge were a Court or a Cofiittee and beinge resolued it was a Co\u2122, though onely for one purpose, he began after cofienda\u00e9on of his lp* noble gouerment, to speake some- what of the office of a Gouerno\u2019 but his lp: recalled him to the buissines of the daye, tellinge, it was not nowe time to make harangues touch- inge the Duty of a Gouerno\u2019.  M\u2019 Edw: Iohnson the Lawyer declared his opinion that the Deputy and Secretary were not by their duety bound to enter but onely the maine passages of buissines concluded and the materiall point\u20ac han- dled in the Court\u20ac and not matter of word\u20ac: Wherevpon it was no preiudice to their reputa\u00e9on, that matter of word\u00a2 should be reexam- ined or reformed.

[134]  M' Wrote complayned that diuers psons were scattered in sundrie places of the last ||Court|| who disswaded them that satt about them from passing of #m\u00a5 thinges in his fauo\u2019 and therefore desired they might be silenced, and he did not doubt but he should haue a noble Tryall.

To this m\u2019 Wrote replied that diuers lackies and Servingmen at the Lower end of the Hall held vp their hand\u00a2\u20ac against him and com- plained of m* Carter for it.  But m\u2019 Deputy answeared that the matter of Coppie was carried by a very great deale of Odd\u00a2 in the number of hand\u00a2 and that of those that satt in the body of the Hall.  M\u2019 Wrote said that m\u2019 Brooke, m\u2019 Smith and 8* Edwin Sandys onely had spoken against the grauntinge him of a Coppie and thereby hindred him, and seemed to complaine, that it was against the course of all Court\u00a2 of Iustice and praide God the same course might be held when the like cause should befall him: To w\u2122 S* Edwin Sandys said Amen, wishinge he might neuer haue a fairer Tryall nor better Iustice: And withall added that he did not conceaue m* Wrote to be aceused but was the Accuser both of the Counsell and Companie.  M\u2019 Wrote complained of the Secretary that would not suffer him to take note of the Co\u2122 because as he said he had no order for it.  ",
    "846": "JANUARY 81, 1628 = > 199  M\u2019 Wilmot said that his opinion was, it was the generall conceit of the Court that he might take note before the Coppie was put to the question, but it was replied by divers others, that it was not the meaninge of the Court y\u2018 he should take not\u00a2\u20ac; it beinge said that: if he might take what Note he would, it were all one as to let him take a Coppie but that it was the Court\u20ac Order that he should haue a free and large pvsall as himselfe would w\u2122 the Secretary affirmed he had at his howse accordingly. [135]  But m\u2019 Wrote still complayninge for want of not\u00a2, offered to depart the Court, w\u2122 if he did, the Ea: of Southampton said the Court would notwithstandinge proceed as beinge sufficient Iudges of the true entringe of the Court and wherein they might proceed although he were at Yorke.  Wherevpon m\u2019 Wrote stayd, complayninge againe for want of Note, and that the Court\u00a2 beinge sett downe much to his preiudice he could not make his full defence: And therefore said he would make his defence legally and by some other course And that if the Quarter Court righted him not, he would appeale to the Kinge the fountaine of iustice and mercy.  But m\u2019* Deputy said, that the Secretary told bim, that m*\u2019 Wrote had taken large notes wherevpon the Secretary said m* Wrote had written out halfe a sheit of pap, But m* Wrote said it was only in what Pages thing\u00a2 were.  S' Iohn Dauers said, he held it impossible for the Secretary to sett downe each mans pticuler speach at large And therefore conceaued that if the materiall point\u20ac and substance thereof were rightly taken, - it might satisfie the Court.  M\u2019 Wrote replied that this opinion would mislead the Court and there- fore desired that they would take it into their serious considera\u00e9on howe much that course might tend to his preiudice and disadvantage.  M\u2019 Wither moued that seeinge m* Wrote talked of appealinge to the Kinge, it might be remembred that when the pointe of Not\u20ac was in  ",

M\u2019 Wrote againe protested he would appeale to the Kinge in the selfe same termes as he did before.  M\u2019 Wrote said that m* Wither had said abroad that my Lo: of South- ton might as a Priuy Counsello\u2019 comfiitt him, and protested that vnder that feare he durst not speake freely.  The Earle of Southampton made Answeare that he need not feare any such thinge from him, for whatsoeuer respect and addi\u00e9ons he had, he left them all when he came to this place and came here onely as their Treasuror.

Wherevpon m\u2018 Wrote said that there was an omission in the very front vizt that m* Deputy presently after the settinge downe of the Court excused himselfe that the Court kept on the Sufier Ilande Quarter Court daye could not be then read because it was not drawne vp for want of time, and therefore desired that the readinge of the Court might be put of till the next Court followinge it, and this excep- tion he said was verie considerable for if the Court had bin read wherein was declared howe the buissines of Salaries passed, it would perhapps haue so well informed him, that he should not haue spoken so much as he did.  This Ofiission m* Deputy confessed to be true but protested it was not out of willingnes but of forgettfullnes, and sodid the Seer\u00e9 where- vpon it was ordered to be inserted as appeareth in the said Court.

The Ea: of Southampton replied it was not nowe the question what S' Edwin Sandys said at another time, but what he said then and therevpon demaunded of the Court their opinion, who generally agreed that the whole speach of 8* Edwin Sandys and that clause in pertic- uler was rightly sett downe, and beinge put to the question it was by a generall erec@on of hand\u00a2 confirmed that all those speeches were truely and rightly sett downe.

S' Iohn Diauers said that he was himselfe a wittnesse of y\u00b0 great care that the Comittee tooke touchinge the Salaries, but thinke it will not ~ be this dayes worke to answeare the Obiec\u00e9ons made against them, and therefore moued that they might nowe onely heare the opinions of the contrary side and to morrowe to consider of them and so pre- pare the buissines against the Quarter Court.  M\u2019 Wilmer said he was verie much discouraged and so were others whereof he would nowe shewe the cause.  The first cause was about the im- porta\u00e9on of the Spanish Tobacco.  The second touchinge the Salaries.  ffirst he said in the Preamble to the Roll he had obserued that the Companie are to beare a 10\" part in the iointe Stocke for bringinge home of Spanish Tobacco and gaue their Seale for the Security.  Whereby he conceaued that if the iont Stocke faile priuate mens estate both here and in Virginia are lyable to make good the Companies  ",

[153]  ffurthermore in the Preamble there is no caution or dispensa\u00e9on men\u00e9oned, in case the Kinge of Spaine shall raise the price of Tobacco w he hath alreadie donn as he is credibly informed.  Also he obserueth that the Vndertakers haue but one yeare graunted them, for the bringinge in of the Spanish Tobacco, w\u2122 by reason so great quantity thereof is here already in this Kingdome cannot be brought in but with much losse or verie smale gaine if the price thereof be enhaunced in Spayne.  It beinge almost 6, of the Clocke it was vpon mo\u00e9on generally agreed by erec\u00e9on of hand\u00a2 that the Court should be continued duringe pleas- ure This donne m\u2019 Wilmer was desired to proceed.  Wherevpon he said he had obserued also in the Roll that the Importa- \u00e9on of Spanish Tobacco is to be consigned to the Comittee by whome that buissines is to be managed to the benifitt of the Vndertakers who are to haue no votes in the carriage of that buissines but must be wholly left to the care of the Director and Comittees.  His second cause |lof|| discouragement he said was the matter of Sal- aries but spake not of it to any but the Comittees.  His first reason for that the matter of Salaries as he hath heard here in Court was sodainely and vnduely carried, that the Comittee treated supficially thereof by the fires side that the Deputy was called awaye and therevpon that Comittee brake vp and did nothinge: At the next meetinge it was sodainely concluded vpon and so brought to the Quart\u201d Court where he obserued a great deale of silence and many hand\u00a2 held vp against it.  2 Reason that the Salaries were vnseasonably giuen because no seruice was pformed nor was it knowne howe well they would be deserued as also in respect there is no money in Cash, but the Companie verie much in debt.

M\u2019 Caswell moued that whereas m' Wilmer desires there might be fower Comiittees he might be one of those that should laye downe their Salaries and m\u2019 Barbo\u2019 also desired he might do the like.  M\u2019 Bennett said he had bin present at these passionate proceedinge and that he was as much greiued at these intestine differences as at the late Massacre: And said that he obserued many to be discouraged at the grauntinge of the Salaries, but his hope then was his lp: would haue disperced those Cloud\u20ac awaye: But for his owne part he said he  ",

M\u2019 Wilmer protested for the better clearinge of himselfe from that suspicon w\u2122 some might haue of him vpon a supposi\u00e9on that he spake out of Enuy toward\u00e9 the psons of those that had Salaries that he spake it freely out of his conscience.

[155]  These thing\u00a2 thus debated vpon it was at length agreed and ordered by erec\u00e9on of hande\u00a2 that a Court should be be warned to meete to morrowe both forenoone and afternoone to consider of the matter of Salaries and of the best course that may be taken for setlinge of that buissines.

But the title of it beinge Obiections against the Salaries, it was resolued to goe on with the Proposition deliuered to the Sumer Nands Companie and desired to be recoffiended to the Virginia Companie and desired to be recofiended to the Virginia Company, and by the Preparatiue Court, wherein it was read and ordered to be consid- ered of at this daye w\u2122 was read all ouer together and afterward his Ip: read the first Article w* was this followinge (vizt) ffirst the places of Director and Deputy shall absolutely be laid downe, and the Salary giuen to them shalbe wholly saued: The two Companies may supplie the place of Director in their extraordinary Courts called for that purpose.

Secondly it was obiected that the two Companies haue more buissines already then they can well pforme and therefore they would neuer be drawne together vpon such occasions so frequently as were neces- sarie.

    "876": "PEBRUARY 4, 1006 \u00b0  . 229  S' Edward Sackuill said that it was a verie great indignity to impose it vpon the Lorde that were the Gouerno\u201d\u2122 to attend continually such buissinesses as the Directo* and Deputy were to pforme.  As for m\u2019 Deputy he protested that though he spent his whole time in the Companies buissines yet he was not able to ouercome halfe that was to be donne for want of helpe, and declared howe that men were not able to be gotten together for the auditinge of the Companies Accounte\u00e9 and that w\u201d them many other of the most waightie buissi- nesses of the Companie laye neglected: Wherefore it were to ouer- throwe all to put more vpon the Officers and Companie.

Concerninge the second Article w\u2122 was as followeth (vizt)  There shalbe one sufficient marchant chosen Treasuror to whome the Companie may be pleased to giue 100\" salary.  ffirst it was obiected that the Salary of 100\" was so smale as there might almost be as much lost in tellinge of so much money w\u2122 in receauinge and payinge could not be lesse then 100000\" and that to giue a 100\" to aman of such sufficiency as that place required and that must vndergoe so great a charge as that was, and that must giue con- tinuall attendance thereon, was an vnreasonable thinge nor would any man vndertake it except some that ment by tke imployinge of the money or otherwise to make some extraordinary benifitt.  It was also alledged that the East India Companie when their Stocke was but 100000\" p Anim had giuen 300\" and sometimes 4 or 500\" to their Treasuror.  It was also declared that of necessity the Treasuror must engage him- selfe for takinge vp of moneyes for the buissines especially for the payment of custome.  In the end after much debate and dispute of the matter, the Court generally agreed, that the reward of 100\" was nothinge propor\u00e9onable and seemed so sensible of the smalenes of the Salary and the greatnes of the charge and paines, as they generally declared themselues vnwill- inge to accept of the seruice of any such as would for such a matter, vndertake it: wherevpon his lp: vpon that Proposigon made these two questions (vizt)  ",

And whereas it was alledged that the Treasuror might imploye his owne Servante that was not adiudged reasonable to require it: And whereas it was said that this matter and other Offices would be pformed in great part for loue, and for the part publique benifitt,  S* Edwa: Sackuill said ||replyed|| that he had heard great and worthie Merchant\u00a2 ingenuously protest that their end was their owne private proffitt and not the publique good w\u00ae did belonge to publique psons and not to private men.

And further that the bringinge in of the 40000 w* was strictly tied to one yeares Terme and so the Aduenturers had not the same liberty as was by the Contract graunted to the Companie.  Thirdly he desired that if the Companie would beare a part, they would giue better security then their Seale.  M\u2019 Mole also said that he conceaued that the matter of fower Shares and the lendinge of the Companie a Tenth part hindred many Aduen- turers: Herevpon the Roll was read and for m\u2019 Wilmotts doubte\u00a2 it appeared plainely, that the Vndertakers of the first 40000 waight, if they would they might bringe in the rest excludinge all others and if not they might leaue it w\u2122 was conceaued a verie advantageable pointe vnto them.  ffor the second it was declared that the Companies intent was to graunt these vndertakers as much liberty as themselues had and so it was in the begifinge plainely expressed where it is said that they  ",

After this the Article of the Roll was put to the question, that excepted that was before, It was by erecGon of hand\u00a2 generally disliked.

S' Edw: Sackuill said that seing\u00a2 Salaries that haue bin so much talked of, continue but for one yeare and then both Salaries and Officers are newe to be chosen, he could not see what great inconveniences can followe the graunt if the worst fall out.

Wherefore for the preventinge of so great inconveniences as the com- inge in of such psons would breed to the Companie, his mo\u00e9on was that it should be ordered and made a lawe that no enimy or open hinderer of the Plantations or vnworthie should be admitted into this Society, and for the better keepinge of them out he propounded that it might be ordered that if exceptions should be taken against any pson that should be propounded, either as an enimy or euill willer to the PlantaGons or otherwise not worthie of this Society that the admission of such psons should not be imediately graunted at the same Court but respited to the pleasure of the Quarter Court next followinge.

To the first it was answeared that the lawes of the Virginia Com- panie, did not speake one waye or other concerninge that matter, but that that clause was in the Sumer Iland\u00a2 Lawes w\u2122 yet could not be so farr strained as that therefore any enimy or vnworthie pson should be admitted..  ffor the word\u00a2 are ||where it is|| apparantly due But certainely it is iustly questionable whither an enimy or vnworthie person should be admitted But for the second obiec\u00e9on the Ea: of Southampton said that he did not vnderstand ||the Proposition|| to be ment concerninge the passinge of Right and possession of land\u00a2 but onely concerninge the giuinge of vote and settinge in Court\u20ac w\u201c a man might be debarred of, although he had not onely right but possession of land@\u20ac in either of the Companies as was euident by the example of m*\u2019 Wrote who although he was vtterly disabled from cominge to the Court\u00a2\u20ac yet his land\u00e9\u20ac and ffreehold\u00a2 in both the Plantations were not taken from him: Wherefore although the Companie might not deny or debarr any man from sellinge his land to whome he pleased, yet they might refuse to accept of an vnworthie pson as to haue voice amongst them: And this m\u2019 Christofer Brooke said was #e\u00a2 ||not|| onely ||not|| con- trary but agreeable to the Lawes, for in diuers cases of right there was sued out notwithstandinge a writt of Ad quod Damnum before the thinge desired could be effected, And this respite of Admittance desired, was in effect no other then as a writt Ad quod Damnum w\" beinge returned and cleared the Admittance would of it selfe ensue.

As for the bringinge of money in and that the Treasuror should not be at any |lonel] time possessed of any great Soffie, it was thought fitt that once euery weeke the Director. or Comittees or some of them together with the aforesaid Gouernors or their Substitut\u20ac should take  ",

The second branch was, that the Companies and Planta\u00e9ons should paye here onely 12\u2018 the pound of Tobacco for custome and Imposi\u00e9on and be discharged of these extraordinary burdens of Officers Sallaries and other Charges.

A Third reason he said might be drawne from the wisedome of the late Assembly of Parliament where it beinge found by euident proufe and the Spanish Marchaunt\u00a2 confession that the Importa\u00e9on of Spanish Tobacco into this Realme had hindred the Importacon of Spanish money what by the price of the Tobacco itselfe and what by the vnder- sellinge thereef of our English Comodityes for the sudden buyinge vp of the Spanish Tobacco to the value of 100000\" sterlinge by the yeare, w\u2122 hauinge so [226] continued for 10: or 12 yeares then last past, was conceaued to be one principall cause of the scarcity of money in this Realme, and therevpon the lower howse framed and passed a Bill  ",

Touchinge the second branch of 8\u2018 Iohn Wolstenhomes Proposition as it was made at the Counsell bourd (for in other places he had made it otherwise) that the Companies and Colonies should paye to the vse of his Ma\u201c or the ffarmors of his Custome and Impost\u00a2 12\u00b0 for euery pound of Tobacco imported, it seemed that it was much more then that Comodity could beare if the benifitt of the sole Importation were taken from them; ffor if it were true w\u2122 the Obiectors against the Con- tract avouched that the Tobacco in the Colonyes stood them in 2\u00ae 6* the pound, there beinge added thereto this 12*, and 6\u00b0 at the least more for freight and other publique charges of the Plantations it fol- lowed that vnlesse the Tobacco were sold one with another at 4\u00b0 the pound, the Companies and Collonies should be loosers by it of their principall\u00a2 whereas contrariwise there seemed no probable apparance, that in so great a glutt of Tobacco and the meaner sort of the Spanish Tobacco beinge so cheape and the Comodity beinge diuided into so many hundred\u00e9\u00a2 of hande\u00a2, that euer it would be sold at aboue 12\u00b0 or 2\u00b0 the pound at the vttmost and this he said was confirmed by the experience of sundrie later yeares, wherein our Tobacco one with another had not bin sold at aboue that propor\u00e9on: And although the Planters [227] could afford their Tobacco at 12* p pound in the Plan- tations, yet it is cleare that this charge of Tweluepence and 6* more must need\u00e9 cause that all they w\u2122 dealt in that Coffiodity should liue in a continuall losse to their vtter consumption, a veiwe whereof might be taken he said in the late great Magazine w\u2122 beinge comitted into the hande\u00e9 of a wise and prouident Director, after 6; yeares con-  ",

Nowe to the third branch of this Proposition that the Companies and Collonies should be cofiaunded to bringe in all their Tobacco, as like- wise all other Comodities, ffirst into this Realme, from hence to be after vented by trade to other Na\u00e9ons, he said he would not enlarge: much vpon it because he vnderstood that this Proposition had bin formerly made by the Tt\u00a2 aboue a yeare since in his absence and aun- sweared by the Court\u20ac in writinge and so exhibited to their If yet this he would add that the Dealers in this Contract with the Lord Treasuror had at sundrie times acquainted his lp that the Tobacco of the Plantations beinge in point of interest of three seuerall natures the one part belonginge to the bodies of the Companies, another part to diuers Societies, as Southampton and Martins Hundred, a third part to pticuler Planters w\u2122 he thought was the greatest part; that for the Tobacco belonginge to the Bodies of the Companies, it was in the Companies power to bringe it alwayes in, But for the rest the Companies had no power to enforce them, they beinge as free by his Ma\u201d originall Graunt as the rest of his Subiect\u00a2 inhabitinge in this Realme.  Howbeit they thought that as by the rigor of the former Contracto\u2019 the Planters had bin driven to seeke forraigne part\u20ac for their mar- chandize, so nowe by the good vsage w\u2122 they might receaue vpon this graunt of sole Importa\u00e9on and sole sellinge they might be reduced to come hither againe as beinge their best markett butt whereas it hath bin alledged by a verie hono\u2122 pson, in waye of example that the Col- lonies of the Kinge of Spayne vp and downe the West Indies brought all that marchandize to Spayne and no other place he said that he thought that there might be some important difference, if the misin- forma\u00e9ons w\u2122 he had receaued from credible psons were true, the State of Spaine suffred noe other Comodities of the same kinde to be brought into that Kingdome w\u2122 was an exceedinge great benifitt to all his Indy Collonyes, w\u2122 fauo\u2019 if it would please his Ma*\u00ae to vouchsafe to the two Plantations, he doubted not but they would  ",

[240]  S* Edwin Sandys moued them to take the seuerall part\u00a2 of the Con- tract into considera\u00e9on and to reexamine what goode or euill each mayne branch conteyned, and to confirme that w\u2122 shall appeare to be to the benifitt and aduantage of the Plantations and desire a levia- \u00e9on in that w\u2122 shalbe hard or preiudiciall W\u00b0\" manner and order the Court exceedingly approued and accordingly proceeded first therefore it was considered and argued whither the sole Importa\u00e9on of Tobacco vizt That none should be brought but from the Planta\u00e9ons (w\u2122 S' Edwin Sandys said was the founda\u00e9on of the contract) together with the inhibitinge the plantinge thereof in England and Ireland were absolutely necessarie: This proposi\u00e9on of sole Importa\u00e9on was after much debate and examina\u00e9on found to be so absolutely necessarie for the Companies as thereon depended the verie life and subsistence of the Planta\u00e9ons.

But herevnto answere was made, that it were better . for y\u00b0 Company, that the Importa\u00e9on of Spanish Tobacco (since it must need\u00e9 be graunted) should be in Strangers hand\u00e9\u00a2 then in y\u00ae Com- panies; who could better looke to it, & prevent the stealing in, then they could; w could not be done by them, but by raysing a great deale of charge for Salaryes (a thinge soemuch declaymed against) And for the matter of Sole Importa\u00e9on, w\u2122 the Companies had soe- much desired, that was a totall exclusion of all forraigne Tobacco w\u2122 the Companies sought for; But if there was a necessity, that a cer- tayne quantity of forraigne Tobacco must be brought, it was all one to the Planta\u00e9ons, whither it were in the Companies or others hand@; But if soe be it could net ||not|| be procured ||from|| his Ma\u201c\u00ae and the Lo: Treasuror, that a Sole Importa\u00e9on of Tobacco should be graunted to the Companies, w\u2122 a forbidding of all others (except for some smale quantity) and that for Two or Three yeares at y\u00ae most, and this to be confirmed by his Ma\u201d Lfes Pattents, and that together w\u2122 the abatement of Three pence in y\u00ae pound and the Companies left to their libertie to bring in what they pleased; that were indeed a singuler fauour vnto the Plantations, and the Companies should be highly beholding to those Gentlemen by whose meanes it should be procured & obteyned.  As for this mo\u00e9on (as it was propounded) it was not conceaued to be any more in substance, then that whereas there is a quantity of 40000 w* of Spanish Tobacco to be brought in, the Companies should haue the farming of it, w\" was not conceaued any such benefitt, as the Companies should moue therefore.

Wherefore S* Nathaniell Rich was desired by the Court, to bring his Propositions well digested, & fully to informe himselfe, what fauours they might hope to obtaine & vpon what retribu\u00e9on; for as the Prop- osition was now made, it was not conceaued any thinge beneficiall, or that the Companies should stirr in it.

[252]  The Lo: Cauendish acquainted the Company, that the cause of ecall- ing this Court at soe vnseasonable a time, was to acquaint them, how that Alderman Iohnson together w\u2122 some others his Associate had presented a petigon to his Ma\u2018* complayning much of the misgov- ernem\u2018' of the Companies and Planta\u00e9ons these Last ffoure yeares; w to the intent it might not make any impression in his Royall breast to y*\u00ae preiudice of the Company, his Lo\u201d conceaued, that the Company were to thinke of some present course, to giue his Ma satisfacton by a true Declara\u00e9on both of the State of the Colony, & of the cariage of businesses here at home by the Company. But to the intent they might proceed herein w\u2122 greater certainty, the Court sent some of the Company to m\u2019 Alderman Johnson, to desire him, either to bring or send them a copie of that peti\u00e9on, w\u2122 he had deliuered ; who returned answere by them, that he had noe coppy of the Peti\u00e9on, nor did knowe of any that did keepe a coppy thereof, and that the Peti\u00e9on was not against y\u00b0 Company; w\u2122 was likewise affirmed by some of them who were present in Court, & had beene at the deliuery of that peti\u00e9on; desiring the Company not to engage themselues therein, vntill they sawe the Peti\u00e9on (professing that they intended the good of the Planta\u00e9on and the Company as much as any other)  ",

Wherevpon m\u2019 Palavicine (being one of them that was at the deliuery of the peti\u00e9on) sayd, that the things w\u2122 they chiefly complayned of, were perhaps such as the Company had beene often moued about, & would giue noe redresse in.  Wherevpon 8S\" Edward Sackuille sayd, that although Aldfan Johnson would not send a coppy of y\u00ae petigon, yet himselfe and some others in y\u00ae Court, could fully & certaynly informe the Company of the sub- stance thereof. He sayd therefore, that Peti@on was in effect a com- parison of the Gouernem*\u2019 in former tymes w\u2122 the latter ffower yeares, & that in Three pointe.  ffirst that in former times, the Gouernem\u2018 was soe mild & moderate, as a multitude of Aduenture\u2122 were brought in; but now there was much oppression and iniury offred both to Aduenture\u201d & Planters.  Secondly that whereas formerly things were carryed quietly both here and in y\u00ae Planta@ons; now there was nothing but conten\u00e9ons & dis- sentions to y\u00ae ruyne allmost and ouerthrowe of the Planta\u00e9ons.  Thirdly that whereas diuers excellent Comodityes were formerly sett vp, now there was nothing but Smoke & Tobacco. Wherevpon they desired his Ma\u201c that a Comission might be awarded, that these things might be amended..  This being deliuered vpon his certen knowledge to be the substance of y\u00ae Peti\u00e9on & confirmed by y\u00ae Lo: Cauendish, it was by a generall erecton of hand\u20ac conceaued, that this Petig\u00e9on and Complaint was against the Ccmpany it selfe; and so that they accordingly ought to iustify themselues, & to defend their proceedings against these vniust  ",
