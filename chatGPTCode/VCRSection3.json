Wee make noe doubte but hee hath deliuered the Gouerment w\u2122 an accompt of his doings into your Lops hands. Wee haue received from him by the George a very straunge letter which together w\u2122 those Informations y* wee haue agaynst him by sundry Witnesses lately com from thence doe importe more discontent to the Aduenturers heare & more hazard to the Plantation then euer did any other thing y* befell that Action from the beginning.

W Answ\u2019 to the Exceptions and those other Additions were here like- wise read, and are these ensuinge. [33]  The Answeare of the Comiittees to certen exceptions taken on the Lord Treas- urors behalfe to the Proposicons of the Companies touchinge the sole Impor- tation of Tobacco.  First his lp: requires that the offer of a fourth part with some condi- conall addition be altered into an absolute graunt of a third parte.  The Coffiittees make answeare that the Generalities of the Companies do con- ceaue the offer of a fourth part with the conditon of enlargement annexed, to haue haue bin so large, as that it would haue been accepted: Notwithstand- inge the Comittees will doe their best endeauors to drawe them by pswasion to yeald to this Demaund of a Third part, So that there be no further burdens laid vpon them: w\u201c if there should be they thinke it not possible to bringe the Companies to yeald vnto it.  Secondly it is required by his Ip that there be no discharge of the Patent of Garbellinge.  The Cofiittees answeare that they are crediblie informed that the Patent for Garbellinge hath not hitherto taken effect vpon any man as beinge question- able, first whither Tobacco be garbellable at all, and secondly whither the propor\u00e9on of a groat vpon the pound be not excessive, consideringe that some Tobacco is daylie sold for litle aboue that value (all duties discharged) And in perticular for themselues the Companies alledge that by their precedent Letters Patent\u20ac graunted from his Ma\u201c* they stand free and discharged from all Taxes besid\u20ac the Customes: Notwithstandinge the Comittees conceaue, that if his Ip: would be pleased, that in this Contract and Grant intended the Companies might be clearely dicharged from all clayme of that Patent: It would be a great inducement to the Companies to yeald to that third part desired: Whereas contrariwise if they should conceaue that besid\u20ac that Third part and the old custome expressed in the printed booke of Rat\u20ac (w\u2122 they yeald to paye for their two Third\u00e9) they shalbe also charged with this grote for garblinge it would amount in the whole to a full moytie of their goode\u00a2.  Thirdly his Ip: doth not hold it reasonable that the Kinge should be charged with any fraight considering that his right to the third doth growe vpon the arriuall of the same within these his Kingdomes But his Lp: is well pleased that in all other charges after the said arriuall the Kinge beare his part accordinge to his proportion of a third.

Addition of certen clauses assented vnto to be inserted in the said Con- tract hauing bin omitted in the first Propositions.  That there be a Clause inserted for restraint of bringinge in Spanish Tobacco aboue 60000 waight.  That there be likewise inserted in the Contract a Graunt or Couenant from his Ma\u201d against the grauntinge of Licenses to Retaylors of Tobacco: But that the Sale thereof may remaine free as hitherto it hath donne.  The ratinge of the prices of Tobacco aswell for the Marchant as the Retayler, his lp: is pleased to leaue to be sett downe by the Companies vpon full debate of all reasons thereto incident.  Whereas they haue receaued from his Ip: the medit of the quantity of Tobacco brought in these seauen last yeares endinge in Michas i62i amountinge to 1420854.  The Comiittees desire that by a newe examinagon it may be more perticularly sett downe howe much thereof was roll Tobacco and howe much was leafe because of the different customes and that the whole may be reduced into a certaine Soffie of money: of w Some one Third to be paid by the Kinge and  two Third\u00a2 by the Companie and the Customers to make noe further demaund.

W* newe Proposition appearinge verie greivous vnto the Cofittees, and such as did crosse their original] purpose, they made replye with eight reasons against it w\u201c they also caused to be deliuered ||in writ- inge|| to his lp: being these ensuinge.  The Comittees haue lately receaued his Ip: pleasure vpon a newe Propo- sition not formerly mentioned vizt That for these two next veares either the Companie should be bound to bringe in 60000 weight of Spanish Tobacco, or in case of their vnwillingnes to be thereto tyed they should be content that some other might bringe in 40000 weight of Tobacco: whereof his Ma\u201c* to haue likewise the proffitts of one Third.  ",
    "698": "62  RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  The Cotiittees make Answeare that they conceaue that the beare publishinge of this Propositon would breed in both the Companies so great aversnes, that they would be vncapeable of that perswasion w\u2122 they nowe trust may pre- vayle to induce them to yeald to the former point\u00a2 in question.  The reasons which moue the Comittees to be of this opinion are  these ensuinge.  1. They say that the example of bindinge men to bringe in any forraigne Comodities, whereof there is is sufficient growinge within the Kings owne Dominions will seeme verie strange, and such as they suppose hath not bin heard of in any part of the world. 2. They say that the former Patentees for the sole Importa\u00e9on were free from this Bond. 8. They conceaue that this proporton doth ouerthrowe the former Contract in the most materiall part\u20ac thereof, especially if it should be yealded that any other besid\u20ac the Companies should haue liberty to bringe in any Spanish Tobacco. 4. They leaue it to his Lps: graue consideraton whither the forbiddinge to plant Tobacco in England: and the coffaundinge thereof to be brought in from a forraigne Country, beinge conceaued to haue bin a chiefe cause of the want of money in this Realme would not be greivous to the English Subiect, and greatly preiudiciall to the Patentees in their reputacon.  They saye that the proporton men\u00e9oned in the Proposition of 60000 waight seemeth verie excessiue, and more then was brought in, in diuers of the said seauen yeares, when there was no restrainte at all for bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco.  They conceaue that this Proposition may in effect clearely crosse the two mayne ends proposed to this Contract, namely the proffitt of his Ma\u201c* and the benifitt of the Plantations: seeinge that it is generally knowne and confessed, that there hath bin in these later yeares as much Tobacco vnduely brought in without payinge of Custome, as that w\u2122 hath bin orderly brought in by the Marchant w\u2122 if it hath heretofore bin 12\u00b0 out of the Kings waye will nowe vpon this Contract ||willl| be neare ten times as much, and the onely waye to auoyde that fraude and mischiefe, is the certaine discerning of the seuerall kind\u00a2 of Tobacco, wherein there can be no erro\u2019: Whereas contrariwise vnder the coulo\u2019 of Spanish Tobacco, it wilbe vnpossible to avoide the stealinge in of ten times as much, whereof the former Patentees haue had deare experi- ence, So that if his Ma\u201c* should gaine by that Proposition some thousand of pound\u00a2 one way, he should rufi hazard of loosinge twice as much by wrong- inge the great Contract, and this reason is of like force touchinge the benifitt of the Plantacons w\u2122 together with his Ma\u201c proffitt must stand and fall growe and diminish. [35]  ",
    "699": "JUNE 29, 1692 \u2014 63  They saye that the bringinge in of so great proporton of the best Spanish Tobacco must abase vtterly the price of the Tobacco of both the Plantations whereby the disproffitt aswell to his Ma'* as the Companie may proue greater then the benifitt conceaued by this newe Proposition.  And touchinge the Plantations, it appeareth most manifestly by the experience of this yeare that the bringinge in of that quantitie of 60000 waight hath kept downe the Virginia and Suffer Ilands Tobacco at the same rate as formerly: So that by the admittinge of this Proposition the Plantations should depart with one Third of their Tobacco without any retribuzon in the price as was at first proposed.  Lastly the Committees saye that beinge left at liberty accordinge to the former Propositions if they shall finde hereafter by reason or experience that the bringinge in some Spanish Tobacco may proue a matter of benifitt to the Kinge and Companie they shall haue great reason to apply themselues there- vnto within the lymitt\u20ac prescribed and with better caution then could be obserued if they should admitt of any Partners.  Howbeit it beinge afterward made euident vnto them and therevpon much vrged that the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco for a certaine time was of that importance as might not be omitted.  Herevpon the Comittee takinge into ||their|| serious considera\u00e9on howe avayleable it wilbe vnto both the Plantations that his Ma\u201c proffitt goe hand in hand with the Companies, and on the other side considering that if this Contract did not proceed a worse accident might befall, they applyed their endeauors to the best of their vnderstundinge to sett downe some meanes so to qualifie the said newe Proposition, as might be least preiudiciall to the Plantatons: w\u2122 thought fitt to restraine to these three lymitacons: ffirst that the Couenant for bring- inge in of Spanish Tobacco be lymitted to two yeares and no longer: Secondly that the quantitie be reduced to these propor\u00e9ons, namely not to exceed 60000 waight nor to be lesse then 40000: Thirdly that it be with this condi\u00e9on that the Spanyarde\u00a2 do not raise the custome or other burdens vpon it or the present price that nowe it is sold fer at in Spaine and that the markett\u20ac of Tobacco in Spayne be in all respect\u00a2 as free as formerly they haue bin; or otherwise the said Cou- enant for bringinge of Spanish Tobacco \u00a2e to be void and discharged.  ",
    "700": "64 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  Hee also signified that in reguard this newe Proposition had appear- ance of damage and danger both to the Companies and Plantations, they therefore thought fitt to extend the whole Contract but to three yeares in certaine and afterwards for fower yeares more, yet so as the Companies to be at liberty to dissolue this Contract vpon a yeares warninge giuen either at the end of the second yeare or any yeare after.  All w\u2122 Proceeding\u00a2\u20ac of the Cofiittees beinge thus related and read and the Court duely waighinge them, acknowledged the Comittee had proceeded herein with as much care wisdome and circumspection as possibly they could desire and themselues much bound to the hono\u2122\u201d Lords and others the Cofiiittee for the extraordinary paynes they had taken in this buissines.  And because it appeared there were nowe some thing\u20ac propounded w\u2122 the Company neuer heard before as namely the bringinge in of a certaine quantity of Spanish Tobacco and the yealdinge of a Third part thereof to the Kinge, they desired time till the next Court to consider thereof as also of the best meanes of preventinge the stealinge of any more then the propor\u00e9on lymited, if that of necessity must be  yealded vnto.

But touchinge the Patent of Garbellinge, w\u2122 the Coffiittee desired to be discharged of, The Lo: Treasuror said it was out of his power to recall what his Ma** had alreadie graunted vnder his great Seale to certaine priuate gentlemen: w' whome notwithstandinge he made no question they might compound vpon reasonable condi\u00e9ons, or otherwise they had liberty to stand vpon the alledged priuiledge of their Patent and benifitt of the comon lawe (if they conceaued that might help them) for his lp: herevpon verie noblie professed he did vrge this present Contract no further, then as it might well stand with the future good of \u00a7both\u00a7 the Plantations.  Whervpon the matter beinge taken into debate by the Companies, Some conceaued, that as it would be greivous vnto the Aduenturers  ",
    "703": "JULY 1, 1682 67  so would it be vnto the Planters in Virginia, nor could it well stand with the safety of the Plantation, if the Planters vpon halfe proffitte be forced to paye also a third part of their Tobacco to the Kinge: But it was answeared by reason they were to paye the Kinge in the Specie of Tobacco and not in money and for all other duties to paye only the mediti of the Custome (if they might therewithall be discharged of the matter of Garbellinge) it was verie probable (the buissines beinge duly managed) they should not be in worse case then they were before: Wherevpon some moued that the contract with his Ma\u2122 might be condi\u00e9onall with proffer of a fourth part forthe present vntill they might be eased of their Couenant for bringinge in Spanish Tobacco and also quitt of the said Patent of Garbellinge: And others moued that a Clause in this Contract might be inserted to free them from it, but it was answeared that a Precedent Patent could not be infringed by any after Graunt nor was it held fitt so much as to ques- tion the pluiledge of their owne Patent w was sufficient against it.  After w\u2122 debate with some other allegatons tendinge to impugne the said Contract, and the Lord\u00e9 that were present desired that the buis- sines might be proceeded within an orderly fashion, and brought one waye or other to a certaine Conclusion and resolu\u00e9on; S8* Edwin Sandys herevpon moued that for a more orderly proceedinge herein, the whole buissines might be reduced to certaine heades, and that each of those heades might be throughly debated of, and the Court to passe their iudgement seuerally vpon each, and [38] finally in con- clusion vpon the whole bargaine of the Contract: And he said that he had obserued in the reasons and Allegac\u00e9ons, w\u2122 had bin hetherto made, that some of them did directly impugne the Contract or some branch thereof, and some other did moue questions onely of certaine difficulties that seemed to depend vpon the orderinge and managinge of this buissines, w difficulties seemed not to be of that importance as to disharten men from it if the Contract it selfe were assented vnto: And therefore to proceed with the Contract it selfe, he first acquainted the Companie that this matter of contractinge for the sole Importation of Tobacco ||had|| moued originally from an offer made for the same, by the then Gouernor and Deputy of the Com-  ",
    "704": "68 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  panie for the Sumer Ilands who had bin also Treasuror and Deputy for this Company as was openly deliuered at the Counsell Bourd in presence of himselfe and many others of the Companie nowe in Court Wherevpon it was conceaued by reason of the quality of the persons the offer had moued from the two Companies; w\u2122 at the same time was absolutely denied and disavowed by the Members of both Com- panies then attendinge their tp\u2019. But the first mouer of this Contract for the sole Importa\u00e9on cominge to no higher an offer then of 10000\" Rent by the jeare, It was vndertaken by others, namely 8\u2019 Thomas Roe and his Associat\u20ac at a much greater rent, who for the raisinge thereof, besides their Patent of Contract for sole Importa\u00e9on procured also a Proclamation from his Ma\u201c, straightly inhibitinge all others to bringe in any Tobacco into this Realme without the Patentees license, w* was the cause of the Companies then attendinge their Ip*. Where- vpon a graceous Referrence from his Ma\u201c they obtained liberty not- withstanding the said Proclamation to bringe in 55000 w* from the two plantations whereof the Companie for Virginia did bestowe their whole part vpon the other Companie, 8S\u2018 Thomas Roes yeare beinge ended, the same Contract hath bin vndertaken this yeare by m\u2018 Iacobe, though not at the same rent who contrariwise hath procured (as he hath bin informed,) a cofiaundment to the Companie to bringe in all their Tobacco, w\u2122 it seemed was to the no greater content of the Com- panies, then the first restrainte from bringinge in any at all without lycense: These troubles as they all knewe had befalne the Company by reason of those Contracte for sole Importa\u00e9on, and that not longe after in thankefullnes to his Ma\u201c for prohibitinge the plantinge of Tobacco in this Realme (w\u2122 was donne without any suite from the Companies) The Companie of Virginia had yealded for 5 yeares to double their custome.  But the Lord Treasuror herevpon obseruinge what greiuous molesta- \u00e9ons the Companies haue sustained from time to time in their pro- ceedings by reason the said Contract was managed by others, did therefore nowe make offer thereof, to the Companies, that if they so liked, and should finde it to be for the good of their said Companies and the Plantations they might nowe contract with his Ma\u201c for the  ",
    "705": "JULY 1, 1622 ' 69  sole Importa\u00e9on of all Tobacco whatsoeuer: So that it was nowe to be considered whither they thinke it more fitt for them then any other to entertaine this Contract with his Ma\u2018 w\u2122 he said was the first pointe to be resolued on in this buissines.  After longe pause and much dispute, it was desired at length it might be put to the question w\u2122 was proposed in this manner. [39]  Whither the Companies of Virginia and Sumer Iands thought fitt to entertaine this contract with his Ma\u201c for the sole Importa\u00e9on of Tobacco vpon such condi\u00e9ons as should be agreed on or suffer the same to be entertayned againe by some other: Herevnto the Court generally signified their wilingnes and consent to entertaine the said  Bargaine.  The second question proposed by 8\u2019 Edwin Sandys to be considered of, was at what rate this Contract should be concluded vpon, there hauing bin a fourth part of the Tobacco offered to his Ma\u201c* w\u2122 would not be accepted.  In declara\u00e9on whereof S* Edwin Sandys further signified, that my lo: Treasurors speach was that seeinge his Ma\u201c proffitt was to be raised onely by Sale of Tobacco and not in certainty of money, he was so to prouide, That the Kinge his M\u2018 were noe looser by this bargaine: to prevent w\u2122 hee hauinge duely calculated the medium of Tobacco that haue bin brought in the last seauen yeares and considered of all circumstances incident herevnto, he said he could demaund no lesse then a Third part of the Tobacco for his Ma\u2122.  S\u2019 Edwin Sandys further signified that the Comittee entringe into considera\u00e9on of this pointe founde by the rat\u00a2\u20ac that the Tobacco is nowe sold at that they paid alreadie litle lesse then a Third parte, all charge considered. As for the custome insisted vpon for the Kinge, It was presumed the price of Tobacco would heareby be so much aduanced as would giue the Companie a convenient retribuGon.  The Comittee further informed the Companie that my Lo: Treasuror said that if the Companie shall at any time desire to transporte the  ",
    "706": "70 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  Tobacco w\u2122 they cannot vent here at home into any forraigne parte, it shalbe free alwayes from Custome.  It was further intimated, that it was intended that the King\u00a2 part of the Tobacco and the Companies shalbe sold together and not deuided till the moneys therevpon be raised.  As for the intricacy w\u2122 was supposed would happen in the sale thereof, in reguard of the different goodnes of the Tobacco (whereby it was conceaued men would be the more witixge careles in the makinge and curinge thereof, if once they vnderstand it shalbe sold confusedly together) Answeare was made it should be sorted and valued accord - inge to the goodnes: Wherevpon it being agreed to put it to the question whither the Companies did not thinke it better to contract for the sole Importa\u00e9on and sale of Tobacco and yeald a full third part thereof to the Kinge ouer and aboue their part\u20ac of auncient custome rather then breake the bargaine with his Ma** The whole Court did generally agree to giuea Third. [40]  The third question offered to their considera\u00e9on by S* Edwin Sandys was touchinge the newe Proposition of bringinge in a quantitie of Spanish Tobacco, against w\u2122 S' Edwin Sandys signified the eight reasons lately read were opposed beinge conceaued it would in effect cleare crosse the two mayne endes proposed to this Contract namely his Ma\u201d proffitt and the benifitt of the Plantations But his lo\u201d return- inge answeare that this was a matter of so great importance and con- sequence as could not be dispenced with, The Comittees herevpon did endeauo\u2019 to qualifie it with such limita\u00e9ons as had bin before recited from w\u2122 as they had bin also since informed his Ip: did not dissent.  This pointe beinge a longe time debated by the Companie, a question was moued whither in case the 40000 w* proposed beinge transported into any other forraigne part\u00a2\u20ac and not into England would be allowed the Kinge havinge his Third duely paid him.  It was conceaued it must first be imported otherwise it would not sat- isfie, but yet if then it could not be here vented there was noe doubt, but they might freely export it to the best Markett\u00a2, Some were also  ",
    "707": "JULY 1, 1622 71  of opinion that the Kinge would gaine but litle by the bringinge in of Spanish Tobacco, in reguard so much the more of the Companies Tobacco must be transported elswhere for want of Sale, At length at the request of the Companie it was put to the question; namely whither the Companies did not thinke it best for them to vndergoe this condi\u00e9on of bringinge in yearely 40000 w\u201c of Spanish Tobacco for the two next yeares onely with those other qualifica\u00e9ons, w\u2122 had bin formerly read rather then to breake the Contract intended with the Kinge: The Court did generally declare themselues willing to vnder- take it: Prouided that casualty at Sea be excepted, and those other condi\u00e9ons graunted that haue bin alledged.  The next question offered by 8S\u2018 Edwin Sandys to their considera\u00e9on, touchinge the addi\u00e9on of charges, namely the matter of Garbellinge and fraight: Touchinge the first it was alledged by some of the Com- panie, that it appeared the Companies had two string\u00a2 to their Bowe, namely the benifitt of the cofion Lawe, and the power of the Kings Letters Patents formerly graunted to them.  It was also informed by other of the Company that this Patent of Garbelling beinge questioned by the lower howse at the last meetinge of Parliament was adiudged by all the Lawyers of that howse to be a greiuance both in the Creation and (if euer it proceeded so farr) much worse in the execuGon.  Wherevpon it beinge put to the question whither the Companies thought it not fitt to proceed in this Contract and leaue the matter of Garbelling in the State it is rather then otherwise to desist: The Court generally agreed to leaue it so, and to insist vpon the validity of their owne Patent and the benifitt of the coffion lawe if need be. [41]  The last question where it was alledged by 8S\u2019 Edwin Sandys that the Lo Treasuror consented that the Kinge should beare his Third parte of all other charges after the arriuall of the Tobacco here, at w\u2122 time his interest vnto that Third did begin, but not to looke backe to any charges preceedent.  ",
    "708": "72 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  This pointe beinge throughly debated and with much opposi\u00e9on, The Companie at length desired it might be put to the question: w\u2122 was proposed after this manner: Whither they thought it not better to paye the whole fraight of the Tobacco, That is to Saye, aswell for the Kings Third part as their owne, rather then to breake the bargaine with his Ma: the Company by plurality of voices consented to paye the whole fraight.  S' Edwin Sandys likewise moued that for auoydinge difference or questions that might arise on the King\u00a2 part about the appointinge of Officers and allowances for their Salaries and for other charges about this buissines, that it might be added to the rest of the Articles, that the Companie may haue power to choose their said Officers, and that their Salaries and all other charges be rated and sett downe by them in their generall Court\u00a2\u20ac and that vpon their Account the entire charges be defalked and allowed.  These buissinesses beinge thus ordered the last thinge taken into con- sideraGon was the reducinge of the whole Contract by writinge into Articles to be presented to the Lord Treasuror the next daye, w\u2122 Articles beinge assented vnto by his Ip: are to be offered to the iudge- ment of the Quarter Court held on Wedensday next to be finally con- eluded and confirmed.  Wherevpon the Court entreated S' Edwin Sandys to take the paines to drawe vp the said Articles, and beinge perfected the Court humbly entreated the Ea: of Southampton together with 8\" Edwin Sandys to repaire to the Lord Treasuror some time to morrowe about the premisses.  A mo\u00e9on was made for diuers Patent\u20ac to be made readie against the Quarter Court, for w\u2122 order was giuen for the drawinge of them: And further ordered that the Patent\u20ac and some other buissinesses should be read and ordered by the morning\u00a2 Court that daye.

After this vpon occasion of a petiton exhibited to the said Court by Elizabeth Smalley Widdowe for deliuery of a fower oxen shee pre- tend\u20ac vnto, in Virginia, There was related the proceedinge of the said Widdowe Smalley against Captaine Argall and the cause of her Retracta\u00e9on of what shee had formerly complained of to the Kinge in her peti\u00e9on against him, confessinge freely that the said Capt Argall caused that Retracta\u00e9on to be made at the Do\u2122 Commons refusinge to sett ouer her Husbands Executorshippe vnto her vntill Shee had first sett her hand and Seale to that writinge: The matter whereof (shee said) Shee did not well vnderstand; Contrariwise shee iustified her former complaint made to the Kinge against Captaine Argall, protestinge shee was by noe other meanes moued therevnto but by the wrong\u00a2 he had donn her and that the peti\u00e9on was drawne by a freind of hers at her request dwellinge in Tower streete.

Hee further also signified that true it was that one thinge fell out in his yeare of beinge Treasuror namely the sendinge out of Captaine Argalls Shippe both victualled and manned from the Colony into the West Indies whereof complaint beinge made from the Gouerno\u2019 and Counsell in Virginia as of an Act that might worke their vtter [47] extirpacon, he could no lesse then giue notice thereof accordinge to his oath to the Lords of his Ma\u2018 Priuy Counsell, wherein he did nothinge otherwise then by the direc\u00e9on of the Gouerno\u2019 and Counsell and with as much modera\u00e9on as the cause could possibly beare.

And in reguard of the appearance of Damadge and danger that might ensue to the Plantations by this newe Proposition the Comiittees thought fitt likewise, that the whole Contract should be extended, but to three yeares in certaine, and afterward for fower yeares more, Yet so, as the Companies to be at liberty to dissolue the Contract vpon a yeares warninge giuen at the end of the second yeare or any yeare after, All w proceedings are at large related in the said Court of the 29 of Tune last.

But 8\u2019 Edwin Sandys signified that the Lord Treasuror had since sent amore fauourable Answeare vnto the Companie touching the same exceptions, for being informed that the Tobacco in Virginia had three seuerall proprietors, as first the Tobacco belonginge to the Companie, Secondly the Tobacco belonginge to perticular Societies and Planta- Gons, Thirdly the Tobacco belonginge to priuate men, (acquired either by purchase or by their psonall Aduenture) the Companie ouer the two later sort\u20ac had no power to prohibite or authority to comand them to bringe their Tobacco hither, but were free and at liberty by their lawes and graunte\u20ac to carry their Coffiodities to what markett\u00a2\u20ac they please.

The Ea: of Southampton acquainted the Court that he had that morn- ing receaued from the Lord Treasuror by 8\u2018 Arthur Ingram certaine pposigons (concerninge the Contract) w* St Arthur Ingram certified by his letter that the Lord Treasuror would confirme and ratifie w\u2122out any further variagon at all, if the Companie would yeald therevnto.  The Proposi\u00e9ons beinge read m\u2018* Deputy said that the difference of them nowe sent from these formerly propounded by the Companie was the cause that had solonge kept their tps in Counsell, and for the differences (after an exact pervsall,) they found them to be these (vizt:) that the 9* Article was left out, and two newe ones added w\u2122 in these newe Propositions were the eight and Tenth Article, whereof the first giuinge a Third yeare for the bringinge in of the 80000 w* of Spanish Tobacco, in case it could not be conveniently donne in the two first was by their tips and all the Counsell conceaued to be a matter of advantage and benifitt, but the ||two]|| other were the thinge that they were nowe to take into their considera\u00e9on: ffor the first w\u2122 was the 9\" Article left out, concerninge the settinge of a rate and price vpon the Tobacco aswell for the Companie as the Retaylors, S* Edwin Sandys said that the Lo: Treasuror did therefore leaue it out, because he-thevekt- ||it is thought|| needles at least the first part for settinge a price vponn the Companies Tobacco it beinge in their power to do what they would therein And for the rest that in case the price should be stinted in the Proclamation, it would not be in the Com- panies power afterward\u00a2 to raise it w\u00ae hee esteemed might proue of so great damage vnto them as if they knewe themselues they would no waye desire it: Against this it was obiected that the restrayninge of the imoderate prices of Tobacco by stintinge it at a reasonable rate would be of great reputaG\u00e9on tothe Companie; inreguard that thereby  ",
    "776": "\u2019  NOVEMBER 20, 1622 me 139  men should not haue the occasion so much as to wast their estate: and further, that by stintinge it at a reasonable price, would cause that men would not so boldly adventure to steale it in, when the dan- ger and hazard was so great if they were taken, and the gaine could not be great though they escaped: And this the Companie Comittee in their first consultaGons, had conceaued to be one of the mayne Stopps and barr to keepe out Spanish Tobacco: To w\u2122 it was replied that the prices could not be so lowe stinted, but with such a largenes as there would be lefte a verie great deale of aduantage to them, that | could steale it in, wherefore that preuention would not in effect proue of that waight as was conceaued: And for the first obiection, it was said, that if the Companie from the first hand did sell at indifferent rat\u20ac, it was impossible for the Retaylors, fer-theRetaylers any longe time to sell at excessiue prices, for all men would after a short while fetch it of the Companies as it were at the Wellhead, if they found they were exacted vpon by the Retaylo\u2122. [89]  It was moued by some that if it were not fitt the prices be stinted by the Proclamation, yet it might be agreed, that the Companies should haue a power to stint it from time to time as they pleased: but that was generally adiudged to be a thinge contrary to all the rate of trad- inge and of equity, and such as no Retaylers would deale with the Companie vpon, for havinge the sole sale in their hand\u00a2, it was in their power to haue what they would of them, and if likewise it were in their power afterward to sett their prices, it would be in their handes at all times for their owne aduantage to vndoe them, neither was this Proposition thought to be sufficiently qualified by a mo\u00e9on w\u2122 some made, to restraine the altera\u00e9on of prices to two sett times of the yeare onely, wherefore after longe and serious debatinge of the point, it was put to the question and by hand@ ordered, that that article as the Lord Treasuror desired should be cleane lefte out.  ffor the second ProposiGon it was after much debate and reasoninge thought to be soe dangerous as the Companies might noe waye there- vnto agree, It beinge conceaued that estima\u00e9on of the damage might be so great as might vtterly vndoe the Companies, wherefore it was  ",
    "777": "140 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  thought most necessarie to desire a qualificaton of that Proposition and to reduce the danger vnto some kinde of certainty if nothinge eles could be obtained: To w\u2122 intent the Ea: of Southampton was humbly requested by the Court together with S* Edwin Sandys to treat with the Lo: Treasuror thereabout and to bringe it to such forme as might be tollerable; w\u2122 if it could be obtayned in any reasonable sort, the Companie seemed willinge to accept of it, And whereas nowe noth- inge could be concluded, the Court did transmitt the power of it fully ratifyinge and confirminge the bargaine and Contract vnto the Quar- ter Court for the Sumer Iland\u00a2\u20ac to be held the Wedensday after; wherevnto all the Aduenturers were likewise to be warned.

[89]  It was moued by some that if it were not fitt the prices be stinted by the Proclamation, yet it might be agreed, that the Companies should haue a power to stint it from time to time as they pleased: but that was generally adiudged to be a thinge contrary to all the rate\u00a2 of trad- inge and of equity, and such as no Retaylers would deale with the Companie vpon, for havinge the sole sale in their hand\u00a2, it was in their power to haue what they would of them, and if likewise it were in their power afterward to sett their prices, it would be in their handes at all times for their owne aduantage to vndoe them, neither was this Proposition thought to be sufficiently qualified by a mo\u00e9on w\u2122 some made, to restraine the altera\u00e9on of prices to two sett times of the yeare onely, wherefore after longe and serious debatinge of the point, it was put to the question and by hand@ ordered, that that article as the Lord Treasuror desired should be cleane lefte out.  ffor the second ProposiGon it was after much debate and reasoninge thought to be soe dangerous as the Companies might noe waye there- vnto agree, It beinge conceaued that estima\u00e9on of the damage might be so great as might vtterly vndoe the Companies, wherefore it was  ",
    "787": "140 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  thought most necessarie to desire a qualificacon of that Proposition and to reduce the danger vnto some kinde of certainty if nothinge eles could be obtained: To w\u2122 intent the Ea: of Southampton was humbly requested by the Court together with St Edwin Sandys to treat with the Lo: Treasuror thereabout and to bringe it to such forme as might be tollerable; w\u2122 if it could be obtayned in any reasonable sort, the Companie seemed willinge to accept of it, And whereas nowe noth- inge could be concluded, the Court did transmitt the power of it fully ratifyinge and confirminge the bargaine and Contract vnto the Quar- ter Court for the Sumer Lland\u00a2 to be held the Wedensday after; wherevnto all the Aduenturers were likewise to be warned.

    "812": "DECEMBER 4, 1622 at 165  ffor the second point of m\u2019 Wrotes former speach vizt vpon the Com- panies bearinge a Tenth part in the Aduenture, S*' Edwin Sandys said that the Counsell and Committees had taken that waightie pointe into their serious considera\u00e9gon, and they were of opinion that it was most necessary to engage the Companie in this Iointe Stocke for bringinge home the Spanish Tobacco, for that thereby the Aduen- turers should haue the Companies assistance and protec\u00e9on vpon all occasions (as need should require) And that this condi\u00e9on was desired by the Aduenturers themselues, who without it would not haue vnderwritten in the said Roll; As for the matter of Security (w\u2122 was so much stood vpon) he said the Tobacco it selfe, aswell as the Seale of the Companie should lye at Stake for it.  And touchinge the engagement of mens private estat\u20ac hereby: therein was no danger; it beinge cleare by lawe that onely the goode of the Corporation are lyable to the debt\u20ac thereof, Concerninge w\u2122 he said he had taken aduise of most sufficient Lawyers: And m\u2018 Caswell said, that m* White the Lawyer (who newly was departed out of the Court) havinge heard this Disputa\u00e9on did affirme that priuate mens estate could not be lyable to the Debt\u20ac by the Seale of the Corpora\u00e9on but onely the goode of the Corpora\u00e9on it selfe.  Notwithstandinge m* Wrote still persisted in his former opinion, that this buissines was not fairely carried nor a due course taken for pre- paringe of matters; but were hastily shuffled ouer, and that he could not be pswaded but each Member of the Companie (vpon grant of the Seale for Seeurytie) was bound to make this good, out of his owne private estate, alledginge that he had likewise asked Counsell of Law- yers whose iudgement was as he had deliuered. ||And was the rather confirmed in that opinion because of the late example of the Muscouy Company.||  Wherevpon m\u2018 Alderman Johnson desired the Companie to be wary in giuinge their Seale for the Security and therevpon cited a case of late time happned vnto the Muscouia Companie who beinge indebted longe since and hauinge giuen their Seale for Security diuers Brothers of that Companie were troubled and sued for the same:  ",
    "813": "166 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  M\u2019 Mellinge replied it was true that a leviaton for payment of the Muscouia Companies debt\u20ac was ordered by the Lorde of his Ma\u201c most honorable Privy Counsell to be made out of the gaines made vpon their seuerall Stocke in the seuerall yeares when those moneyes were supposed to be borrowed and taken vp at interest and not to be laid vpon the whole body of the Companye or them that were not Traders in those yeares or since. [108]  But m* Withers made Aunsweare it was true some were troubled but none of them had therefore paid any thinge, but were freed and cleared thereof: And he added further that the newe Iointe Stocke it selfe was exempted from those former debt\u00a2: W\u2122 m\u2019 Alderman Iohnson said was by perticuler agreement before the Stocke was beguii: Howso- euer m\u2018* Withers said he was suer that the priuate Brothers of the Companie were by order of the Counsell-Bourd acquitted and freed from molesta\u00e9on.  M\u2019 Deputy said that beside the vnseasonablenes of the Proposition since it could not be revoaked at least till the next Quarter Court the thinge it selfe seemed verie strange to him, for if their were danger to priuate mens estat\u20ac by reason the Companies beare a Tenth part only; howe much greater danger there was, if the Companie should beare the whole w\u2122 they were bound to doe hauinge taken it vpon them by giuinge of their Seale except priuate Aduenturers as they had beguit eased them: Wherevpon he said the Counsell and Coiittees conceaued that they had donn a verie espeaciall great Seruice to the Companie so to continue and order the matter: That hauinge taken so great a bur- then vpon them, they should be eased of almost all, and the care of one onely Tenth part left vnto them: And if the feare of this Tenth part did trouble men what should the whole doe, w\u2122 otherwise was like to lye vpon the Companies: ffor whereas m\u2018 Wrote said, that this Clause was the onely cause of the vnwillingnes of diuers to vnderwrite . in the said Roll w\u2122 otherwise would haue aduentured largely in the buissines, m\u2019 Deputy said it was a principall clause that invited them that had already vnderwritten and \u00a2hke\u00e9 ||when|| it was replied that if the Companies had not \u00a7a part\u00a7 there was one would vnderwrite 500\" m\u2019 Deputy made aunsweare that if the Companies had not a part the  ",

Vpon this disputaton the Lord Cauendish tooke occasion to informe the Court howe fairely and orderly the Counsell and Cofiittee had proceeded in this buissines: The Lord\u20ac and the Counsell ||sittingell both forenoone and afternoone the day before the Quarter Court beinge attended also by the Comiittees the whole day, and that thinge were so seriously and maturely debated as there growinge a difference of opin- ion in one pointe amongst the Gemittee ||Counsell||, the Ea: of South- ampton did perticulerly enquire the opinion of euery one and in the end the resoluGon was made accordinge to the maior part of voices. [109]  M\u2019 Wrote said that he knewe many eyes were vpon him and desired the speeches he had spoken might be sett downe.  Wherevpon the Argument beinge still maintayned with such violence and vnorderlynes against so many good reasons as had bin alledged, m\u2019 Deputy made this open protesta\u00e9on that for his part in reguard he had knowne m\u2019 Wrotes great zeale and forwardnes in the buissines of Virginia, he did not thinke that these thing\u20ac were propounded and vrged by him out of an evill minde, nor that they came from him- selfe, but from some others who had by wronge informa\u00e9ons and ground\u00a2 perswaded him to doe what he did, directly with an inten- tion to cause distrac\u00e9on and variances and by iealousies and doubte to hinder the vnderwritinge of the Roll and consequently to drawe the Companie into the Penalty of not performinge that condi\u00e9on, w if any such evill happned he protested this dayes worke was the cheife occasion: Wherevnto m\u2018\u2019 Wrote made answeare that he would not haue m* Deputy thinke so: basely of him as to be so lead by any man, for he protested it was his owne what he spake and not out of any suggestion vnto him: And therevpon vrged againe that m* Dep- uty would put his former Proposition to the question: w\u2122 if he refused he said the Counsell there ||plsent|| were to doe it.
