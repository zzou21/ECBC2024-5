And in regard the Court was now accordinge to the dyrec\u00e9on of y\u00b0\u00ae Letters Patents to proceed to elec\u00e9on of new Officers. m'\u2019 Deputy breifley related the reasons y* had formerly moved them to continew their old Officers ever since the Quarter Court in May\u20141622. And for their better sattisfacton read vnto them the seu%all passages in the seuerall Quarter Court\u20ac since touchinge that matter.  And further signified that wheras the Company had made a Lawe for lymittinge the Treasuror and Deputy to continue in their places but for 3 years at once the said Law had allso been taken into considera- \u00e9on by the former Comittee Counsell and Court, who conceavinge noe detryment could ensue to the Company by dispenceinge with that Lawe for the present, but rather a singuler benefitt and advantadge  vnto them as things now stood, did therfore thinke fitt to suspend y\u00b0 Lawe allsoe for the present by leavinge itt free for the Company to make choise of any former Officers although their times were determyned.  Whervppon itt beinge taken into Considera\u00e9on by this present Court, after all reasons heard and debated, itt was at length agreed and ordered by a generall erection of hands that the Lawe concerninge the lymittinge of the Office of Treasuro' and Deputy to the terme of 3 years should be suspended and accordingly resolvinge to goe to Elec- \u00e9on, the Earle of Southampton was generally and vnanimously nomi- nated and beinge putt in Election with the Right Hono\u2019 the Lord Cauendish, the place fell to the Earle of Southampton by haueinge 69 balls, the Lord Cauendish: fiue and the Negatiue box.2. whervppon y\u00b0 Court besought the Lo: Cauendish and the rest of the Counsell present to acquainte his Lo\u2019: with this choyce and how humbly and instantly the Court besought his Lo?: to accept therof.

The Company beinge thus confirmed in their good ~ opynion of him and withall consideringe they had no Stocke att all lefte to furnish out a new Gouernor conceived they were of necessity inforeed to continue him still, and therfore thought fitt to propound him at this Quarter Court to stand in Elec\u00e9on for the said place.  Whervppon S\" ffraunces Wyat beinge proposed by the Court, and some earnestlie moveinge that 8S\u2019 Samuell Argall (in regard of his worth and desire therevnto) might stand in Elec\u00e9on with him they were both ballated and the place fell to S\u2018 ffrauncis Wyat by haueinge 69 Balls, 8\u2018 Samuell Argall 8 and y\u00ae Negative box 2.  And itt was likewise further ordered that a tre should be writt vnto him to pray his acceptance of the said place for 3 years longer, and  \u2018further to assure him that the Company would be verie carefull to  giue him a due Supply of Tenant\u00a2 in discharge of their promise and Covenante w\u2122 him att his first goinge ouer.  The Court was moved that wheras in the generall narra\u00e9on that was this afternoone to be made before the Coffittee of the lower house of Parlyament there would fall out divers passages touchinge S\u2019 Nathaniell Rich who beinge a member of that house itt was not fitt to charge him without leave first obteyned. Therfore that the Company would please to petigon the house, that hee might be ordered to be present at the said Comittee and here such charges as should be given him. w\u2122 course beinge well liked of by the Court and a peti\u00e9on to that effect presented: itt was twise read and maturelie considered of: and beinge approved was by a generall erec@on of hands (two onely dis- sentinge) ordered to be presented to the house in the name of the Company: And that if itt should com there too late, then to present itt to the Cofiittee in the afternoone.

The Court takinge into Considera\u00e9on that the matters to be delivered to the Parlyament did fall vnder fower generall heads (vizt) the Matter of Tobacco and all the greivances therin: The buisines of the Contract, The proceedings of the Comissioners and the passadges since, and conceivinge that neither Counsell att Lawe could be soe fully informed as were requisite, and phapps would not be soe well heard, did therefore thinke fitt to beseech the Lord Cauendish S* Edwin Sandis and 8\u00b0 Iohn Dauers to take vppon them the delivery of the three last part, (vizt) The Lord Cauendish the buissines of the Comission, S* Edwin Sandys that of the Contract, and St Iohn Dauers the last: And for y\u00b0 matter of Tobace\u00ae they imposed itt vppon m* Deputy.

    "1190": "540 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  M' Deputy acquainted the Court that although the generall buisiness of the Company preferred in their Peti\u00e9on had not peeeded in Par- lyament, yett the pticuler of Tobacc\u00ae by the exceedinge greate care and wisedome of S* Edwin Sandys assisted with the Lord Cauendish and other worthy members of the Company had a verie happie issue. The Importa\u00e9on of fforraigne Tobace\u00ae wherin Spanish was included beinge presented to his Ma\u201c: as one of the nyne greivances of the Realme in the matter of Trade wherin the House humbly besought releife and that for the good of England without any Men\u00e9on or rela- tion to Virginia in their Peti\u00e9on,\u2014although hee said hee Doubted not but in their heart\u20ac the wholl House had a very speciall regaurd to the advancement of the Planta\u00e9ons. And as this course was in itt selfe as effectuall as if itt had been done by bill to obteyne y\u00b0 excluding of Spanish Tobacco, soe itt was much better then if itt had been done by the bill w\u2122 was Drawen the last Parlyament, since w\u2122 time the state & price of Tobace\u00ae was soe much altered as itt could noe way now beare that charge of 12\u00b0 p pound w\u2122 that bill laide on itt butt therby the Comoditie would haue been as certainely ruyned and ouerthrowen as any otherwise.  In w\u2122 reguard m* Deputy professed that neither himselfe nor divers others could with any good courrage sett forward\u00a2 that course of the bill. But this second way bringinge with itt all the good of the bill, and leavinge out the evill therof hee thought it could not bee too much commended nor 8 Edwin Sandis (to whome the Company was behold- inge therfore) sufficiently thanked.\u2019  The Court rested much sattisfied in this matter, and full of good hope that itt would com to a good end. Butt beinge informed that those seuerall parties who in other kindes were to receave benefitt from the redress of the other heade\u00e9 of greivances had seconded the House w\u2122 their pticuler Petigons to his Ma\u201c: The Court thought itt very neces- sary and fitt that the Company should doe the like and soe much the rather in regard that the House of Commons haveinge onelie Peti- \u00e9oned for the generall good of Trade w\"out refferrence to Virginia the  1 Among the Ferrar Papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, are several drafts of acts and petitions  on trade in the writing of Nicholas Ferrar, and nearly of this date.

M\u2019 Deputy acquainted the Company hee received late notice of Three Shipps newly arryved from Virginia w\u2122 had made a very speedy pas-  sage and hadd brought good news from thence (viz) that the people were all in health and the Colloney well stored with Corne and other provisions.  Hee likewise made knowne how much 8\u00b0 ffraunces Wyat was Cofii- ended for [387] his good service and noble Carriage of himselfe in his Goverment. And moved that seeings the Company had againe chosen him for Gouerno\u2019 for 3 years longer they would also consider how to supply him for the time to com with his iust number of Ten- ant\u20ac and to recompence him for the losse hee hath susteyned therby.  W\" beinge taken into Considera\u00e9on itt was held both iust & reason- able that the Company should make good their Contract with him. And thervppo by a generall erec\u00e9on of hands agreed and ordered that signification should be given vnto him of his reelection. And in respect the Company wanted means to send over more men ynto him hee should be supplyed with his full number out of the Compa- nies Tenants there; And for to reeompence his former losses itt was referred to the Considera\u00e9on of the Quarter Courte.

    "1263": "[Refer ks  Note  In 1906 the Library of Congress published, in two quarto volumes entitled \u201cThe Records of the Virginia Company of London,\u201d the text, from the manuscript in the Library, of the Court Book containing the minutes of that company\u2019s mectings, and of the meetings of its council, from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624, together with an elaborate and learned introduction by Miss Susan Myra Kingsbury, now professor of social economy in Bryn Mawr College, and a list prepared by her of additional documents illustrative of the company\u2019s history from the date of its chartering until after its dissolution by the Crown and the consequent conclusion of its business, These documents, 764 in number, are listed, with bibliographical references as to their sources, in the section of Miss Kingsbury\u2019s first, volume (pp. 119-205) entitled \u2018List of Records.\u201d The project of publication formed at the time when those volumes were issued contemplated the printing, in additional volumes, of the documents thus listed, or of all those among them that had any historical significance. Their texts are now to be presented, in two volumes num- bered III, IV, of The Records of the Virginia Company of London. The texts have been prepared by Miss Kingsbury with great care and accuracy. The first 273 of the documents arranged for publication are presented in the present volume. A nearly equal number, completing the series, will be presented in Volume IV, now in the printer\u2019s hands. The two volumes will constitute an addition of great magni- tude, and of the highest interest, to the materials for the early history of Virginia, and their preparation, distinctly a labor of love on the part of Miss Kingsbury, places all future students of that history under a heavy debt of gratitude to their accomplished editor.  Herpert Putnam, Librarian of Congress. Vv ",
    "1264": "Prefare  The documents contained in Volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia Company of London are original papers, official and other, of (he company or relating toit. While the Court Book of the Virginia Company, published as Volumes I and II of this series, presents minutes of the meetings of the corporation, the sueceeding volumes contain materials that vivify its decisions and decrees, explain the difficulties met and overcome by that redoubtable group of adventurers, reveal the petty jeal- ousies of the administrators, and especially record the controversy between the company and the Crown that resulted in the dissolution of the corporation and the ereation of the first erown colony of Great Britain.  Four official sets of records are herein printed or cited. Two are published in full. One set is the original papers contained in the volume, now preserved in the Library of Congress, which has long been referred to as \u201cManuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III.\u201d One set embodies records of action in law courts by the company or against the company. \u2018They are taken from the records of the various British courts and were found in the Public Record Office. Two sets are not here included as originally planned. They have been published in full since this series was begun. One is the \u201cCourte Booke\u201d of the colony, February 4, 1622/23, through February 9, 1632/33. Jt is now printed under the title \u201cMinutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia,\u201d edited by Dr. H. L. McIlwaine (Richmond, Va., 1924), The other set of documents has been published in the \u2018Acts of the Privy Council, Colonial\u201d, volume I (London, 1908). Some actions of the council that concerned the Virginia Company of London are not to be found in that publication. They are therefore here printed. The collection called the Sackville Papers, dis- cussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I, page 114, was, by the courtesy of the third Lord Sackville, examined by Prof. A. Percival Newton, of the University of London, and the documents relating to Virginia were printed in 1922 in the American Historical Review, Volume XXVII, pages 493 to 538 and 738 to 765. Those bearing dates earlier than 1623 are not here reprinted.  Included in this volume are manuscripts from two collections that are unique. The \u201cSmyth of Nibley\u201d papers give the history of a single settlement, called Smyth\u2019s (or Smith\u2019s) Hundred, that is typical of the verious hundreds of the colony. They extend from February 3, 1618/19, to August 1, 1622, inclusive. These papers are all in the New York Publie Library. The \u2018\u2018Ferrar Papers,\u2019\u2019 on the other hand, now belong- ing to Magdalene College, Cambridge University, are a veritable gold mine; their unique value is discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume J, They supply a vast amount of information through the correspondence between the colony and individual planters of the colony and Sir Edwin Sandys, Nicholas Ferrar, and John Ferrar, and also between Sir Edwin Sandys and the other officials of the company. Only a few documents are official, including two reports from the council in Virginia, a record of a Somers Islands court, and some less impor- tant iterns of this type. The first paper bears the date June 8, 1617, and the last  November 1, 1624. But only a few go beyond midsummer of 1622. VI ",
    "1265": "vit PREFACE  On the other hand, the \u2018\u2018Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume IIT,\u201d do not begin until August 12, 1621, but continue throughout the life of the com- pany. They differ in character from the Smyth of Nibley Papers and the Terrar Papers. Asstated above, they record official acts of the council in Virginia and include commissions, proclamations, orders, laws, letters to and from the council in London, and petitions to the governor and council in Virginia.  Communications between the company and the Kingor the privy council, and some letters to and from the governor and council of the colony, were spread on the minutes of the company, and therefore appear in Volumes I and II, of this series. They are noi reproduced in Volumes HI and LV, even though the original documents are found in the other collections.  All documents here published are discussed at Jength in the Introduction to Vol- umes I and II of this series. Practically every paper indicated as to be included in the series by the star affixed in the \u2018List of Records\u201d that appears in the Introduction to Volume I is here printed. Two documents (List of Records No. 70 and No. 153) could not be found, and it has proved impossible to secure a copy of No. 12,  Fifty-seven documents dating earlier than April 28, 1619, when the records in Volume I begin, are printed in this volume. They inchide all records that had not heretofore been known or published by Alexander Brown, the Virginia Magazine of History, or other reliable works on the early history of Virginia. Perhaps the most important documents found by the editor that are here included are the \u201cTnstruc\u00e9ons Orders and Constitu\u00e9ons to S' Thomas Gates knight Governor of Virginia\u201d of May, 1609, and the \u2018Instructions orders and constitu\u00e9ons ... to... S* Thomas West knight Lo: La Warr,\u201d 1609/10, by the Virginia Council. These are the first instructions given by the competent authority to a British colony.  Source material for the history of the company through the year 1622 is presented in this volume. March 22, 1622, saw the frightful massacre of colonists by the Indians. The story of that tragedy, the efforts for recovery, and the beginning of the reestablished colony conclude this volume.  The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, chief of the division of manuscripts in the Library of Congress, for his painstaking care in reading the proof to the original documents of the \u2018\u201cManuseript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III,\u201d and to some of the photostats of material in England, and also for his constant watchfulness in seeing the documents through the press.  To Marian Carter Anderson the editor is indebted for her valuable and expert assistance in preparing much of the manuscript, and especially in the difficult reading of practically all of the proof.  Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index of Volume III, and to her the editor wishes to express gratitude for the complete and accurate contribution she has made to the usefulness of the documents in historical research.  A part of the expense for reading the proof and the cost of preparing the index were met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council.  Jun 30, 1932. Susan M. Kinessury. ",
