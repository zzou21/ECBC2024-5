From this ground I raise these 6 heade.?  1. First I vndertake to show the meanes to draw a sufficient Nomber of men that haue good Estates here, to plant in Virginia, wth their persons & goodg, and to Cause the planters in Virginia to plant Estates in England.  ' This copy is in Sir Nathaniel Rich\u2019s hand. It reads in some minor points as though he liad misread the original. It has been compared with Additional MSs. 12496, fo. 454, and dilfers i some important particulars, The document in the British Museum is addressed to the Lords the Council instead of to the Lord Treasurer. Ditferences are indicated in the footnotes following. Still a third text, addressed to the Lord Treasurer, is No. 6157 of the manuseripts of Lord Sackville preserved at Knole Park, Kent, and priated, under the heading, \u2018Captain John Bargraye\u2019s Pro- posals\u201d, in the American Historical Review, XXVIi, pp. 411-514.

For my part T neuer durst secke to take away the populer Government here, partlie because the deliveric vp of Patent@ doth weaken the Confidence that Patentees should haue in * them, and the Patent now granted being to the Company, Con- sisting of the Adventurer, and Planter, and the Gou\u00aemment being now in the Company here, if the Company will by Consenting to this Forme, transferre the Gou?nment to the Planter (to whom of right it belonges) there is no neeessitie that the Patent must be delivered, partlie because there must by necessitie be such Correspondeneic betweene the Planter in  1 This paragraph is omitted in Additional MSS. 12496.

And wt them doth y* Colonie coneurlre], having the last yeare by theire Viecadmirall sent a writing signed by the hand\u00e9 of the Generall Assembly, & directed to his Mat\u2019, wherein having declared, the manner of those Twelue yeares Governenit, they conclide w\u00ae these words, full of passionat{e} griefe: Jud rather then to be redueed to Hue vader the like Goyernement, wee desire his Mat\u00ae that Comissioners may be sent ouer with authoritie to hang [2] vs.  OF this quatlidie was the fist Gavernem'.

The Plants@on being growne to this height by the end of vw\" yeare 1621 it pleased God in his seerett udgement to gine Jeaue toy\" enetuies thereof, by many powerfull & most wicked meanes, to bring it downe agayne to y\u00ae ground,  The first Blowe was a most bloudy Massacre, when by the Treacherous eruolty of the Savadges, about 400 af oT People were slayne; vpon the 228 of March 1621. The terror whereof w\u2122 the losse of much Cattle and other Substance, and on sodayne allera\u00e9on of the state of all dhinges, so dismaide the whole Colony, as they allmost gaue themselues for gone. But then appeared both the love of the Company to the Plhintation, & their great abilitte to goe thraugh therewith: when in supply of this Losse, and for y\" encourigem! of the Colony, they did send that yeare to Virginia 16 Ships ",
    "2609": "APRIL (?), 1626 525  & 800 people, and that altogether at y\u00b0 charges of private Adventurers. For the publiq\u2019 Stock being vtterly exhaust the yeare before, was not able to contribute 500\". toward all this charge.  But this eruell Tragedy of the Massacre, was seconded by Two other sharpe Calamities in y\u00ae very neck one of another:  First Searcitie in the Colony by being putt off from their Grounds prepared, together wt the losse of their season & much seed; besides that, (hrough the troublesommnes of those tymes, they could not freely inploy themsclues in plantinge thercof, no not in those their seanted grounds, many Plantu\u00e9ons heing drawne into few places for their better defenee. W pexteringe of themselues, did likewise breed Contagious siekenesse; wh being cnereased by the Tnfeetion brought in by some shipps, there dyed that yeare of Mortullitie neere vpon 600 more: and the Colony passed much hardnesse in their victuall, by reason of the miscarriage of one of their Shippes, w\u2122 the Company sett forth w\u2122 aboue 500\" worth of Meale and other provisions: But the Shipp being blowne vp w' Vowder at the Sumer Islandes, the Provisions were lost, & neuer came to Virginia  Notwithstandinge these thinges were most grievous to the Company here; yett were they no wayes of Discourugement, but rather seemed to add heat to their former zeale: so as by the begining of the yeare 1623 there appeared in readines \u00a7 & preparation \u00a7 to goe tou Virginia, double that namber of peuple, & Adventurers, that any former yeare bad carried. When ons sodayne the Plantation it selfe was by Captaine Butler in a certayne writinge Intituled, The vnmaskinge of Virginia, soc fowly dixeraeed, and the present miseries thereof so farr amplified aboue Truth, and the future hopes thereof so belowe all good meaninge drided & villilied by divers il willers of the Action, especially some discontented members of y\" Company, as the greatest part of the imtended Supplies for New Plaitations, gave over, as some of themselues will testify to yo\" Lo\u201d.  (6) Yet notwstandinge, the vnited Body of the Company, did even that yeare 1623 send out Eleaven shipps, stured w' supplies of victuall & provisions: although by many cruell Encounters of the Opposites, they were sore hindred and deiected, directly w\" Intention to make theniabandon y\u00b0 busines. But the welfare of the Planta\u00e9on, and the mayntefince of their  ",
    "2610": "526 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  owne honour & eredite, did prevaile so w\u2122 the Company, that though w\u00ae the certainty of their owne extreame losse, they passed in the aboundance of Supply, not only the necessities of the Colony, but even the vnreasonable demande of their Opposites: havinge in fower dayes space that was given them after the notice of the Colonics want, procured the vnderwriting of Power thousand pounds Adventure: w*\" the Hono>* Board of the privy Counsell was pleased w'\u2019 much Noble favour highly to approve.  As for the people that went that yeare in those Eleaven ships, the nomber was not aboue 260: and those procured not wout difficulty, so much had the disgrace of the Plantation spread amongst y* Coffion sort of people:  Neither could it be prevented by the Companie, although they vsed all possible dilligence: soliciting the Comission\u2122 then appointed by his Ma's by a publiq\u2019 Examina\u00e9on of Captayne Butlers reporte, to cleare the truth. But they would by no meanes bee drawne therevnto.  As for the Companie it sclfe, their proceedings & demeano\u2122 were soe opprobriously ealumniated: as deprived them both of abillitie & eredite to doe any good herein: but wt much sorrowe to behold how sencibly and dangerously the good opinion of this Action decayed; so that divers Preachers of note in the Cittie that had begunne in this latter Governemt to pray continually for Virginia, lefte quite the remembrance of it: finding the Action to growe cither odious or contemptible in mens minds: w yet hut a little before was of that esteeme, as divers on their death beds gaue great. Legacies to the furtherance thereof: and even from the East Indies by way of Contribu\u00e9on, hath bin sent by the Factors and poore Marriners aboue 10008 SeerkeS so farr was the reputa\u00e9on of this Action spread, by the prosperinge thereof vnder the latter Governcin', & by their zealous & sollicitous endeavours. We although by the continuall encrease of further suffringes, their Pattent being called in question, receaved a sore check: yet notw''standing their owne Innocencie giving them courage & hope that they should overcome all w honour & thankes of the State: there were Five shipps provided for this last yeare 1624 whereof one of them since the Companies dissolueon, hath given over her yoyage: the other foure haue proceeded, although wt much difficulty, in reguard that a great part of the Passengers that afore intended to goe, fell off. Whereby two of the Shipps w\u2019\" had their Comissions from y* late Companie in May ",
    "2611": "APRIL (?), 1625 527  last, could not gett away till y\u00b0 end of this last yeare, the other one in February, the other in March last.  Thus haue wee given yo\" Lo\u2019 a true Informafon, both of the growth and languishinge of y*\u00b0 Virginia Plantaton, in these Five latter yeares [7] Governem*': wherein no encombrances, no calamities whatsoever could keepe it soe downe, but that it did yearely advance it selfe w'* a most remarkeable growth, whilst the carefull Nurse and tender Mother the Company was permitted to governe it.  Though contagion & sword destroyed many people: yet whilst (he nomber of new did doubly supply those that fayled, it cannot be said, but the Action was in a thriving, In a prosperous course; though not in a cleare or easy.  Then began it to stand, when the Companie was troubled; to stagger, when they were disgracd and discountenaneed; to sincke, when they were terrifyed w\" affrightment of Dissolu\u00e9on; sinee w' tyme there hath bin nothing at all done towards the recovery or helping it forward, but much towards y\u00ae hindringe & bringing it lower.  The poore supply of People & shippes that are gone, are but the remaynder of the late Companies cares & loves. The setters out of the best of then doe affirme, that if they had not beene so farr engaged before tle vnex- pected dissolu\u00a2on of y\u00ae late Companic, they would haue drawne back their Adventures & People.  When they shall arive in Virginia, they will not bring either comfort or supply to the Colonie: but only add to their Culamitic, to their greife. The first Shipp went in August, vietualled only for Pliree moneths: the next in October: neither of them were arived the 25\" of February last. Whereby they must needs come into Virginia in most miserable distresse.  The other two went out soe meanly provided, that how cuer short their voyage shalbe, they cannot but prove an insupportable charge to. the Colony, much disfurnished by the victualling of divers shipps lntely returned thence, and so ill provided by a deceiptfull cropp, w*\" secmed large, but proved seant, as wee dare not but acquaynt yor Lo\u201d. what experience  153007\u201435-  36  ",
    "2612": "b28 RECORDS OF THI VIRGINIA COMPANY  perswades vs, That there is like to followe in the Colonie some great dis- tresse for victualls, exeept by speedy supply hence they be relieved.  There is likewise in the Colony a most dangerous want of Powder, so great, as if the Savages should knowe the advantage they hane thereby, they might easily in one day destroy all o people.  There is most extreame want of hese, shooes, & all apparrell, even to a dangerous empeachement of their healthes: and that so generall, as the provisions earried in these late Shipps, will not as farr as wee cann learne, supply the Tenth part of their necessities.  The want of such wonted supplies, will vndoubtedly much dismay & deivet the Colony. But when they shall vnderstand of the Companies dissolueon, for the continuanee of whose Governeit and the Liberties they enioyed vader them, they were most importunate suitors to his Ma\", and thet they are returned vnder those handes wth they so much abhorred: Wee doubt no possible meanes wilbe found to keepe the greatest and best part of the Colonie from imediatly cominge away.  [8] For wee ure credibly informed, that some of the chiefe, haue allready by sellinge of their Estates, made prepara\u00e9on ypon the first notice of the change, to leaue the Country. But when farther they shall heare the newes of the late Contract, whereby all their hopes shalbe quite extin- euished, and all possibilitie of subsistanee taken from them, wee cannot thinke that any will stay behinde that shall not bee kept by force.  But howsocuer it shall happen: sure wee are that by these alteracons & courses the mindes of the Planters wilbe filled w' sueh Jealousies & sus- pieions, as it wilbe a long while ere they wilbe reduced to a firnie resolucon of setting vp the Rest of their Lives, & hopes. in the Colony: Whieh w* all humble duty wee are bold to say, hath bin & will euer bee a disposition most pernicious to the establishing of the Plantation: And the overcoming thereof by the Company, Wee hold to haue bin one of the greatest services that they did.  This wee conceaue to be y\u00ae state of the Colonie now in Virginia. We? though they should be persuaded or foreed to stay, yet wout supply of ",
    "2613": "APRIL (7), 1625 52u  others sent hence, they must needes come to nothinge in a very short space, although they had noe other enemy.  As for adventuringe hence, what by the disgracinge of the Aetion it selfe, & the vndeserved suffrings of the late Companie, the businesse is brought to such a stand, as seemes ineredible: there being no preparu\u00e9on that wee can heare of not only of any Shipp, but of any man to goe to Virginia, Whereas cofionly for divers yeares before, there were foure or five shipps in readinesse, and as many hundreds of men, at this tyme of y* yeare.  So that even in that reguard also, the Colony will find themsehuies both in great discomfort, & great danger. For although formerly they had no Forte on the Land to hinder a forraigne Enemy: yet especially in the latter tymes, there was such aboundance of Shipping cominge and goinge continually to Virginia, that there hath bin sometymes told Seaventcene sayle together in James River. Whereby besides that it was a continual terror to the Natives, it would haue bin a difficult thinge to endamage the Colonie, w'out the power both of many Shippes, & many souldiers. Wh was amongst divers others, a very mayne securitie & encouragenient, to perswade men boldly to goe to Virginia. But that and all other helpes being now foyled or much empayred, although the nomber of men be at least Three tymes as many as when wee vndertooke the Governem'; yet will wee Ingenuously yeeld, that equall thanks & equall honour wilbe due to them, who shall now recover & restore it to that prosperous & flourishing estate, to w\u00ae by Gods blessinge o cares & labours had brought it, vntill it was marred by them, who as appeares never loved it, but for their owne indirect ends, w they haue industriously pursued,  [9] Thus much touching the present estate of the Plantation, & the late generall decay thereof.

And so ynder colour of advancing proflitt to his Mat* sometimes (as hath bin before touched) wee were forbidden to bring in any Tohaceo, sometimes to bring in but a small quantitie, and sometimes comaunded to bring in all, We\" varying direetions, did so distract & confound the Adventurers & Planters, that it had in a manner ruynd the Plantation. But yet by Gods assistance, & the constaney of y\u00b0 Companic, wee ridd out this sterme also. The instruments in this worke, that espeeiallie appeared were the then S\" Lionell Cranfield, M*\u2019 Jacob, and some others: to the extreame damage of the Company, enrichement of them selues, & deceyt of his Mat: as was at large expressed & offred to be proved in y\u00ae last Purliament.  Thirdly, by the procurem' of that part, divers scandalous peti@ons agaynst the Company in generall, & many in perticuler, did putt vs to much vexa\u00e9on & trouble. But their accusatons were so false, that wee also overcame this Third assault. ",
    "2617": "APRIL (?), 1626 533  After this another stratagem was obtruded vpon vs, virler pretence of freindship & love to y\u00ae Plantation. The Earle of Middesex then Lo: high Treasuror of England, who in respect of his place was [12] to take into consideracon all thinges that had relacon to his Ma\u00ae revenue, \u00ablid first pro- pound to S* Edwin Sandis, & afterwards to y* Ea: of Southampton, y\" Lo: Cavendish & 8\" Edwin Sandis together, that the King, he knewe, had by S' Thomas Smithes meanes & Alderman Johnsons, and some great. freinds & instruments of theires, bin strangely possessed agaynst the forme of our Governem', & y\u00ae consequences of it: & particulerly that they had made such advantage by traducing y* names of y\u00ae Earle of Southampton and s* Edwin Sandis, that y* busines of y* Plantacon fared y* worse for their sakes, That he had allready in Generall spoken w\u00ae his Mat\", & assured hin, that y whispers & rela@ons of those men, had an eye to their owne safetic, and not to the Colonies good; and that therevpon the King referred the whole consideracon of y\u00b0 Plantation, and what was best to be done, to his eare. Vpon this he propounded vnto those before named, that y* best way to engage the Kinge in his care of the Plantations, and to make it impossible for any hereafter to disturbe the Companie, as they had fomnerly cone, was to thinke of some such meanes, whereby the proffitt of his Matt, & the good of y\u00ae Plantation, might hand in hand goe together. And to speake truth, though those he spoke wall, were at first very vinvilling to swallowe this guilded pill, as having heard of y* stile he vsed in negotintinge other businesses of this nature: yet he was so full of protesta\u00e9ons in it, ewer pretending ex || the Companies || good, and w\"\" all procured further inti- ma\u00e9on to y\u00b0 Earle of Southampton, that no service of his could be more acceptable to his Mat then this now propounded: |, that | Vpon these protesta\u00a2ons & assurance, they engaged themsclues to treat of a Contract betweene his Mat\u2019 & the Companies. In the making whereof, y\u00ae suid Earle of Midd remembred not his promised care of y* Plantations, buf im truth from one degree to another, wrested vs to such condi@ons, & sucha rate, as was very dammeagle to y\u00ae Plantatons. But vpon serious debate in many & full Courts, vpon the whole matter wee were resolved, consider- ing the protection of the Colonies, & fauour promised; and to he free from those frequent projects that in former tymes had so much wronged & cis- turbed vs, to accept an hard bargayne: conceavinge that though it were not so good as wee desired, & was fitt to haue bin offerd; yet by it wee should ",
    "2618": "534 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINLA COMPANY  bee in a better case & way of benefitting the Plantations, then formerly wee were. And so in Michaelmas terme 1622 this Contraet we began to be treated of in Easter terme, was concluded by the subscription of the Earle of Middlesex his hand, and by sending the Company word, that that day the \u00a7 whole \u00a7 Counsell board had given their assent therevnto, w? wax the firsi tyme the Companie vnderstood that they had heard of y\u00ae matter,  [13] The Contract thus concluded, a great Tempest arose, by what seerett cause & ynderhand procurement, wee may guesse, but cannot affirme. But in a Court of the Company vpon the 4% of December followinge, one M\u00e9& Wrote Cosen Germane to the Earle of Middlesex (discontented also that hee was passed ouer in the election of Officers.) did w' a passionate & blastring speech, inveigh agaynst the Contract, & the menaging thereo we Sallary; agaynet the proeecding in the Treaty of it, as that it had bin ynduly and vniustly carried, that men had bin overawed; and that it hac hin procured (to private ends. Whereof not being able to make any shadowe of proofe, & persisting still in his violent & contemptuous demeano\u00ae, vypon a fill hearinge, he was thrust out of the Companie; and ypon that ioyned himselfe to 8? Thomas Smith, Alderman Johnson & tha opposite party, & drewe also w him Two more of his Companions, and so now made shewe of a formall party agaynst the Company. But for al this wee still mayntayned the reputacon of o\u00b0 proceedinge.  The next of of troubles in order, (proceeding from what secrett cause, that w followes will give yo\" Lo\u2019? more reason of coniecture, then wee will now affirme,) was that this opposite party then attayned to about 25 in nomber, had some seerett eneouragem! or other given them, directly to oppugne the Contract; wth, as is before declared, was so formally made: And guue some reasons in writing agaynet it to the then Lord Tr\u00e9r; who receaving them, gaue tie Company first suspicon of double intelligence & tudireetnes in his dealinge. But howseeuer, the Earle of Southampton, the Lo: Cavendish, So Edwin Sandis & some other, being called by the Ieurle of Middlesex to his Chamber at Whitehall, then thought, that they had given such answeres to them, as that his Lo? rested satisfied. But his Lot after, speaking wth y\u00b0 Ea: of Soutl\u2019ten and the rest before named told them, that they that had sopposed, were a clamorous Company, and that to make the busines goe current, it were best that their objections  ",
    "2619": "APRIL (?), 1625 535  & of answeres should be heard at the Counsell table. And vpon hearing there of their aceusa\u00e9ons, and o7 answeres, the Earle of Middlesex, who assumed the chiefe knowledge & care of that busines, did in y* close of that hearinge vse the words formerly rehearsed, Of the leaud earriage in former tymes, and of the latter in a manner miraculous recoverie. A greater testimony of o\u00b0 integritie & their guilt, could not be given. But as the sequell will manifest, & us wee haue since found in other of his Lor proceedings, he meant to loose nothing by those worde. [14] Howsoeucr it was, & whatsoever wee suspect, not intending now to dive into those miseries; from that day forward, to y? Conclusion of this busines he professedly made hnnselfe the patron to that side, & enemy to the Com- pany; for wth wee appeale to yo\" Lo\u201d better knowledge.  Afterward@ about that Contract were divers mectings before the Lorde, where it was principally inveighed sgaynst by 8\u00b0 Nathaniell Rich, speaking against the intistice & vneonseionablenes of it; protesting that he had eucr sold his Tobacco for Fiue slullings a pound one wth another, and thet euery pound cost him Two shillings six penee in y* Suter Islands: and now to give a Third away |to the King|| & peradventure y\u00b0 price not to be much higher, was agaynst Justice & Conscience. And here by the way, wee humbly craue leaue to say thus much, that his Conscience now serues him in this new Contract, to foree y* Planter & the Adventurer to sell their Tobaees, the best sort fur 2\u00b0 4\" and the second sort at sixteenc pence a pound. But vpon that former Demonstrative Argument of his, though it were so fully answered as nothing eould be more, yet the Marle of Middlesex tooke his ground to condemne the Contract he had signed, as hurtfull to the Planta@ons; and to comaund the Coinpanies to thinke of propounding a better & to to bring it |/in') writing win Two daies: Wh was aecordingly done: and therein shewed, that y? hardnesse of this Contract, was not Iky the Companies proposition, hut by his Lot pressure. And therefore vrged what had bin offred to his Lo? at the first; that his Mat would be contented wth a fourth, & pet require a Third of e* Tobacco, To w'h in great scorne his Lo\u00ae replyed that take Two pence out of Six pence there would remayne a Groat. But the last Parliament sawe that his best invention, was by adding 3\" to 40\u00b0 to make vp Five pound. But in conclusion that Contract was dissulved, & a comaund Jaid vpon  ",
    "2620": "536 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  the Companies by his Lo\" procurement, to bring all o' Tobaccoes in, vnder colour that Three pence custome was abated; Whereas in truth, by his admitting also of all Spanish Tobacco vpon 8S\" John Wolstenholmes motion, wee could not vent a third part of it here: and so by computa\u00e9on, in respect of the quantitie vnvented, wee paid necre double as much as before: Wh was his only favour to y\u00b0 Plantations.  The Contraet thus dissolved, as publiq\u2019ly damageable, by the incourage- ment of the Earle of Middlesex, & industry of y* Five and twenty before mentoned, (that so place might be made for this [15] Latter Contract, so privatly beneficiall, for so by the effeet it hath appeared): the Governem* was now likewise to be questiond and altred, or else they compassed not their end@. Which to bring about, these two wayes were vsed: First a petigon was delivered to his Ma'y by Allderman Johnson, in the name of the rest, inveighing agaynst the latter Governem', & magnifying the former. And in the end, desiring a Comission to examine the proceedings of thi\u00a7e\u00a7sSe$ last Fower yeares This Peti\u00a2\u00e9on was by the Company at large answered to his Mat\u2019, & wee ioyned in y* point of having o* Actions examined by the Comission: but w'thall thought it iust, & desired, that their Twelue yeares Governent before might bee also examined: Wh accordingly was ordered. The second meanes ysed by them, was to rayse vp Captayne Butler, who hasting from the Sumer Ilandes to Virginia, where he stayed but a few weekes, vpon his returne delivered to his Ma, a Paper called The Vnmasking of Virginia. The substance of wh was, first the dispraise of the Country, & making of it an vniitt place for any English Colony; & next, seandalizing the Governem! of it, both here, & there. What coneerned the Colonie, was proved to be false by Forty witnesses: who ehauneed ta be in Towne then, & had bin often & long in v\u00b0 Colonie: And was endeavored to be mayntayned by him by two meancs only: one by practizing tu gett the hande of Two men vnto it, to whome he owed mony & deferred payment: wha when they heard it read in Co\", protested that they never saw what they sett their hands to, and that Capt: Butler told them it was to a Paper, woh he would shew the King for the good of the Plantation: and desired y* Companies pardon; for whatsoeuer was there said was false. Seeondly he would have made it to haue bin better believed, by a forged Lre w'\" hee brought to S' John Bourechier from his daughter M's Whittakers: who knew it ",

But sinee, both shee & her husband being come ouer, they bothe forsweare it, & say it was none of her doinge nor dircetion. But howsvcuer, hy those meanes the opposite party thus farre obteyned their ends, that by the Defamation, and this trouble ensuinge, a very great nomber that intended to haue gone ouer, were discouraged.  {16] But yet for all this, the Companie knewe their cause to be so inst and iustifiable, that they did not abandon it: but prepared theniselues to give divers charges before y* Comission\", agaynst divers of y\u00b0 partie opposite; & professed themselues ready to make their owne defence whensoever they should be charged. But whilst the Comission sate, farther to discourage vs, first of all o* Bookes, & after y\u00b0 Minutes of them were sent for away from vs: that none of the Lres that then came from Virginia were to be seene by vs, being all seazed on by the Comission\u2122. But touching the rest of y\u00b0 Cariage of that Comission, because it was at large delivered in Parliament, \u00ab& offered to be proved, if further proceedinge in that businesse had not bin forborne vpon a Lre written to y\u00b0 house from his Ma** wee will now to yo\" Lo say only this; That whatsoever was brought by vs concerninge Accounts, Depredaton, misgovernement, & ciuers other erimes, agaynist perticuler persons, was by this Comission, (especially directed by the Earle of Midd,) shufled of for ali the tyme, till the Comission was even at y\" end, and nothing done vpon them. And on y* Contrary, whatsoever could be gathered out of the fragments of Lres from discontented persons in Virginia, concerning |leither|| the place or governem' was diligently collected by them, and receaued by the Earle of Middlesex, as a great testimony agaynst vs; and would not take those other Tres for proofe w wee euer guided o'selves by, and came from the Governour and Coun- sell there. And lastly some three days before their Comission ended, they putt vs on a sodayne to answere to 39 Articles, or else they would take them pro confesso. This they thought for vs impossible to doe. But wee deceaved their expectaton; and they could not find in the least perticuler, any lust ground to make any report agaynst vs.  1 Manuscript illegible, but it may be\u2014\u2018\u2018but answered that she was sick\u201d\u2019. ",
    "2622": "538 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  By all this, the Farle of Middlesex and that partie, pereeaving y\u2019 Companie would not be beaten off a good cause; there was a practise to try whither wee had rather part from the busines, or from our mony. Wherevpon wee were called before the Counsell agayne, and there that side as compassion- ate affecters of the Plantation, vrged the want of Corne & other necessaries there, and that they were like to perish for want of provisions. The Farle of Midd replyed it was a matter of so great importance, & concerned the lines of so many of the Kings Subjects, that if y* Companie would not presently take order for sending Supplies, the State would call in their Pattent. Wherevpon y\u00b0 Companie conceavinge that if they did send supplyes, their Patent would not [17] be taken from them, vnderwritt to a Roule; (though they knewe y\u00ae necessitie was nothing so great,) foure thousand avd odd pounds, w was paid and sent; and those Gentlemen that before seemed so zealous subscribed Twelue pound\u00e9, and paid it not. Vpon wh comparison wee leaue it te yo\" Lom to iudge, w party was the true father of this Child.  This then not sueeecding according to their desires, certayne obscure persons were found out by the Farle of Midd, to be sent into Virginia, as Comission\", for these two ends, as wee haue since found. First. to sifte out what they could agaynst the forme of o' Goyernem' here, & there; & next to persuade the peaple to become Peti@one\u2122 to his Mat* for a newe. We suececeded mot uceording to their expecta\u00e9on. For by the Colonics Peticons, answeres to those Papers that had bin delivered agaynst them here, & divers other remonstrances to his Mat\u2019 from a Generall Assembly there, they shewed the misery wherein they lived, or rather languished in 8* Thomas Smithes tyme; and their happy estate in this latter Governement: coneludinge (at if his Ma\u2019 intended to alter the Governement, & putt it into the former bands, their lumble suite to him was, That Comission\u2019 might be sent ouer to another purpose before declared, The writinges themselues will manifest this more at large.  These Comissione\u2019 thus sent to Virginia, the Earle of Midd & the rest were not idle in further distractinge the Companie here at home. And about Michachuas a mocon was made to the Companie, to give their assents for surrendring their Patient, & altringe the forme of Gavernem*; & a newe one was proposed: W\u00b0 according to order they takinge into consid- ",

Wherevpon a Quo Warranto was direeted by the Marle of Midd suggestion, for the calling in of their Pattent.  In the meane time, to affright men, both from cominge to, & much more from speakinge in Courts, mens words were there carped at & complayned of; and their persons by the Earle of Midd prosequution, were vpon quick hearinge sent to prison. Yet for all this the Comp? stood to their owne Justificagon, & defence of their Pattent.  Now M:' Atturney, according to y* duty of his place, & instruetions given him, vrged y\u00ae misgovernem* of the Companie, & consequently y\u00b0 ruyne of the Plantation. To w point wee were willinge to ioyne issuc. But afterwards in o\" reply to his pleadinge, w'out further enquiry of the former allegation, advantage was taken vpon o* mispleading, & in fine w'out any further ground that wee knowe of, the Patent was in Trinity terme following Condemned: But for any thing that wee haue yet seene, no iudgment entred.  {18] Yo\" Lo\u00ae* by the perticulers before related, do see by what courses wee were reduced to this extremitie. One thing yet wee thinke most necessary to adde; It hath bin said by many, & perticulerly by some principall persons of the opposite partie, that y\u00b0 Dissolutions of these Plantatons was part of the Count of Gondomars Instructions: And certaynely wee found his activenes in negotiatinge here, such, that in bringing about his owne ends, he could create here instruments of o'selues agaynst our selues. Wee say not that he & other Spanish Ministers practised thus amongst vs. These two only perticulers, wee craue leaue to offer vnto yo Lo\u2019s Judgem*.

All w\u00ae being wearied out w* their mallice and imiuries, and louth to spend more of their lives in so vnthankfull a service, are humble suitors vuto yo\" Lo\u2019, that they may be spared from all farther employment in this Action. And that if these men will now at length apply themselues seriously to y\u00b0 busines of of y* Colonie, both w their paynes & purses, 15507\u2014 35\u2014\u201436 ",
    "2628": "544 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  w they haue hitherto spared, and vndertake (w> they owe to his Mat & y\u00b0 State) the repairinge those ruynes of the Plantation, whereof they haue bin the chiefe cause and instruments: the Governement thereof may, as it is, be continued in them, giving fitt securitie for so great a debt & duty. For wee protest vnto yo\" Lo\u2122, vpon our truth & fidelitie, that if his MatY may be served, the Colony seeured & cherished, iustice duly administred, mens rights & states preserved, innocent men not oppressed, and malefactors not protected & rewarded; wee shalbe so farr from envying the glory of their Governement, that extinguishing for euer the memory of ail their former iniuries, wee wilbe ready to doe them all fitt service that they shall require.  By this we hath bin said, yo\" Lo\u00bb will easily perceaue, that obedience to yo\u2019 comaund\u00e9, and a desire that y\u00ae Plantation (if possibly) may yet subsist, is y\u00ae end of o* labour: not that wee intend, or haue any enclinacon, to encomber our selues, wt\u00ae a busines so vexed & perplexed; but only ayme at what may bee to the good of it, though to o' owne trouble. But if yo\" Lo\u201d in yot wisedomes, shall not thinke it fitt to putt 1\u00a2 into their handes: or that they, w\" such caution as may be reasonably desired, shall not adventure to vndertake it: Wee then will notwithstandinge, in expres- sion of o' duty to his Ma\u2018 and the State, in respect of our ancient & present love to y\u00ae Plantation, and for the speciall benefitt that may succeed to ihis Kingdome by such a place of securitie & retreate in America; (the wont. [28] whereof, as by experience in many particulars may be demon- strated, was in the late Queenes tyme the overthrowe of most of o' voyages sett out for the West Indies) for these reasons wee say, wee shall endeauour o? best, but dare not vndertake, to restore what these others haue #i allmost destroyed. But yet that, vpon sueh condi\u00a2ons, as wee hold most necessary for the effecting of so great a worke, that is, some impediments to bee removed, & some encouragements to be given to it.  It hath bin a great errour, for any to imagine, that the persons of these men, who haue of late thus opposed the Companie, were either in nomber considerable, or in adventure to be valued any way at all, to further or advance the prosperity of the Plantation: but rather on the contrary, great impediments to the faire proceeding of it: And therefore whereas the late Companie, haue by the vniust practises of divers of these, and ",
    "2629": "APRIL (?), 1625 545  some of them vnworthy persons, suffered so much in the reputacon of their persons & actions, aswell by private calumny, as also in some publics proceedings agaynst them: Wee shall for that cause most humbly desire, that y\u00b0 Actions & passages of o' late Governem', may be brought to an vpright examina\u00e9on, before this Hono\u2019 Board: and that being found, as wee assure ourselues they will, to haue bin most iust, & euer tending to y\u00ae Plantations advancement, wee may then haue iust repara\u00a2en from those, by whome wee & the Plantation it selfe haue bin so much wronged: That the like dangers may be hereafter prevented, by discouraging others from the same attempts; and that wee the late Company, being restored to the integritic of o' reputacons, may bee the better enabled to goe on wt y\u00b0 Action, for y* tyme to come.  Nowe in reguard of the extreame distresse & poverty, that by these lute practises of y* Colony ts reduced vuto; and by reason of y* disability, & vnwillingnesse of Adventurers, being so extreamely discouraged, and who haue allready wasted a great part of their tyme, and no small part of their estates, in supportinge this Plantation: as also in reguard of the great danger that may be feared from a forraigne encmy: Wee shall most humbly desire, that his Ma\u2018 would be pleased, to yield vnto the Plantation, some such moderate supply, as after the late Massacre was promised in the last Kings tyme; Namely, the settinge out of Foure hundred able men, at the vel- untary charges of the seuerall shiers of this Kingdome, preportionably to be rated. And besides fer y\u00ae present [24] pressing necessitie, to give vs some such reasonable proportion of Munition & Powder, as in reguard of these tymes may be thought convenient.  These difficulties & impediments being eased or removed, wee come now in the last place to present our humble opinions, touching the best forme of Governement to be here established for Virginia; wherein wee humbly offer to yo\" Lo\u00ae considera\u00e9on, whether it may not seeme requisite, that a Companie be agayne erected of Adventurers & Planters for the governmge & menaginge of the affaires of that Plantation. In the waginge whereof, wee haue divided our thoughts into these three branches:  If his Mat should be pleased himselfe to vndertake the Plantation, and the charge thereof to be defrayed out of his Royall Treasure; or otherwise at the Generall charge of the Kingdome: Wee hold it out of question, that ",
    "2630": "546 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  the fittest Governement of the Action, were by a seleet Counsell of Hono & able persons, to be ordayned and appoynted by his Ma\"*, as is vsed in like eases in some forrayne Dominions.  But if the burden & charge must be borne by the Adventurers and Planters themselues; Wee hold it necessary in that ease, that y\u00b0 Governm' thereof be also commended by his Ma\u2019 to them, incorporated as before into a Legall Companie: yet so, as to be assisted & advised by a Counecll to be appoynted by lis Mat\u2019 & bound by oath vnto him; and they also to haue relference in all causes of greatest & extraordinary importance, to his Ma\" himselfe, or to the Lords of this privy Counsell, from thence to take resolu\u00a2on & direction, as was formerly instituted, and in the latter times also practised. And this is agreeable to y* coffion vsage of the world, & in perticuler of this Nation: experience having manifested, that nen are difficultly drawne to adventure any great matter in these Actions, in y* ordering of w\"\u00ae they haue no voice or interest.  For ax for this late third way of Governement, by an absolute Comission, disprovided of other meanes, saue what should be raysed from y* Plan- tacon experience hath taught, that it cann worke no great effect, the hearts of all the Adventurers being turned away from the Action, & y\u00ae Plant\u2122 there in great part, vpon the bare feare & forerunning rumour of this Comission, resolving to come away & desert the Plantation. Howbeit. if such of y\u00b0 Comissione\u00ae themselues, as formerly enioyed or partaked, & now affected this Governement, would haue opened their owne purses, as wus promised to his late Ma\u2019, for the support of the Plantation: [25] it might perhaps haue bin continued on for some longer tyme: Whereas now all men avoiding to adventure vnder them, & they not disposed to give example in that. kind, but rather to agitate and frame Contracts, whereby themselues might growe rich, though w the penury & consumption of the Generall Plantacon: the Colonie there doth wast by hasty Degrees, and will suddaynly come to nothing if speedy, remedy be not provided.  Now if yo\" Lo? shall thinke good to approve of oT humble opinion, (w\"? wee in all duty submitt vnto yor Lo* maturer iudgements,) and that y* Companie he reerected by his Mat\u20ac Lres Pattents & vnder his great seale, as it formerly was: then doe wee further presume to offer ynto yo\u2122 Lo\u00bb considera\u00e9on, these few perticulers here ensuinge. ",
    "2631": "APRIL (?), 1625 547  First wee hold it requisite, that this new Pattent should contayne y\u00b0 same priviledges & Libtics, the like orders & directions, as were in the former: yet w'* this, that if there appeare in y\u00b0 former graunts, any thinge inconvenient, as preiudiciall to his Ma\u2019, it be reformed:  Secondly, in reguard y\u00b0 Colonie, taking all ill pleight at y\u00b0 beginning, doth still runne eke \u00a7on\u00a7 in plying only Tobacco, notw\"standing y\u00b0\u00ae great charges w*\" the Companie was at, in the tyme of the latter Governement, for y\u00b0 setting vp of better Comodities, as Silke, Wynes, Iron, materialls for shipping, and others: that his Mat would be graciously pleased, eon- tinuing the Custome vpon Tobacco, to remitt the custome of all other com- odities for certen yeares; wt wee suppose would be a matter of very small losse to his Mati*, aboundantly to be recompenced in y* yeares cnsuinge; and yet a great meanes to drawe the Colony to those better courses, w\u2122 no orders of the Companie could yet euer effect: And likewise, that y? Custom\u2122 be restrayned from extorting Custome of goods transported thither for mens perticuler provisions, & not by way of Merchandize, as the Law requires.  Thirdly, that in this Pattent there be declared a nullitic of all the proceed- ings of the late Comissioners; having bin vpon iust caase soe extreamly distastfull both to the Adventurers & Planters.  Fourthly & lastly it is desired, that his Mat* would be graciously pleased that this new Pattent be confirmed by Act of Parliam', if y\u00b0 Lords & Coffions wall so thinke fitt. And this wee hold requisite for two important reasons;  First wee suppose it will greatly encourage the Adventure\u2122 & Planters, [26] by giving them assurance of y\u00ae continuance of this Plantacon, and of their seuerall estates & possessions in y\u00ae same: the icalousy w hath bin bred by the late Quo warranto, being not otherwise possibly to be removed. And this encouragem' would be greatly encreased, if by his Mat Royall authoritie, w' consent of Parliament, bothe Planta\u00e9ons might be annexed to y\u00b0 Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, according vnto y* comendable pollicie of some other great Kingdoms.  Secondly by meanes of this Act, the New Company may be inabled to recover y\u00ae Debts due to y* former Company, either vpon Accompt or ",
    "2632": "548 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  otherwise; as also to haue restitu\u00e9on by a Jegall course for the great depre- da\u00e9ons done vpon y* Colonie. A matter tending greatly to the support of y\u00ae Plantation, as also to y* reestablishing of y* good Governeni' of y* same. And this is our humble answeare vnto your Lo\u2122 first proposi\u00e9on.  [half a page blank]  [27] For the second Considera\u00e9on, lefte vnto vs by yot Lor\u00ae\u2122, namely con- cerning an offer to be made, for such a Contract towehinge Tobacco, w' his Ma\", as may both vphould his former Revenue, and not bee greuious to the Plantations, wee say thus.  That vnles in yo\" lor?\u2019 wisdome\u00a7s\u00a7 those Condi\u00e9ons by vs formerly propounded bee yeilded vnto, wee cannot treate of this buissines; for wee come not as Contractors to make a bargaine for our owne priuate lucre, but wt\" an eyfe] only to the publique benifitt of the Plantations, as farr as it may he without preiudice of his Mat\u00ae proffitt; wout any reseruation of seerett@, as in the last Contract were pretended: For in a publique bargaine, betwixt his Ma\u2018 and his people, the most cleere, publique, & direet. pro- ceeding@ will euer recciue the best interpretation.  Wee cannot in our vnderstanding\u00e9 concetue, that any proffer though neuer soe greate, cann be for his Mat aduantadge, but rather the contrary, if it so presse vppon the Plantation, that the Planter shall not be able to lue with comfort by his labour: And so others be discouradged, from further proceeding\u00ae. A greate reucnue peradventujre}| maye be raysed for a yeare or two, but if the Plantation decaye the revenue cannot last: And thus it had beene, if the last Contract had gon on; though the immense gayne had come to the Contractors themselu[es] & not to his Mat.  But now for ourselues, it is true A Contract was formerly treated of betwixt the Company, and the Earle of Middlesex, but as hath been before read ynto yo\" Lor\u00ae\u00ae though it were then extreame hard, yett it is nowe impos- sible, by reason of the worse ease the Plantation stand@ in nowe, then it did then, principally oceasioned by the diseouradgement\u20ac giuen to the Company.  Wee acknowledge vnto yo\u2019 lor\u2019, that the bestewinge banishinge of all Spanish Tobacco, will much redound to the Plantations benifitt, and his ",
    "2633": "APRIL (?), 1625 549  Mat\u00e9 losse: but withall, wee conceaue that if there were no Tobaceo in neither of thei{s] Plantations, itt were better for his Ma\u2018 to loose seauen or eight thousanjd] Pound a yeare Custome by the not importation of Spanish Tobacco, the[nz] to hinder the importation of 100000\" a ycare in money, w\u2122 this Comodit[y] did, as was cleerely manifested to the two last Parliaments.  {28] Howsoeuer, wee intend not vppon the Condi\u00e9ons in the former paper mentioned; to make a meane & contemptible offer to his Mat\u00ae but such a one, as wee conceiue in truth, for the Kings proffitt, to befall as large, & more certayne then this last; and more then at any tyme really came into the Exchequar by this Comoditie. Profferinge soe much, as wee thinck the Planta\u00e9ons can possibly beare & subsist; and goinge as high nowe at first, \u00a7as\u00a7 we shall euer be drawne to yeild vnto. And doubt not, but that yeildinge ynto his Ma\u2018 after the first yeare, 10000\" certayne, and 3000\" a yeure more by Custome, in all 13000\" per Annu, it will be thought more then sufficient from these nowe languishinge Plantations. For in this bargaine the Summer Tand@ as well as Virginia are vnderstood to be eom- prehended. And so wee are confident, that wee haue given yo\" Lor\u201d full satisfaction, to this second proposition, namely, concerninge the offer for such A Contract to be made w'* his Ma\u201c* towchinge Tobaceo, as maye both vphould his former reuenue, and not be grciuous te the Plantations. The perticulers followe.  That the sole Importation of Tobacco, into the Realmes of England, and Treland, be graunted by his Mat Letters Pattents vnder his greate Seale, to the Companies for Virginia & the Sumer Islands.  That his Ma\", by Proclamation inhibite all others, vnder payne of con- fiscation of their Tobacco, and his Mat\u00ae highe displeasure.  That likewise the plantinge of Tobacco in England and Ireland, be for- bidden by the saide Proclamation vnder a greiuous penalty.  In Considera\u00e9on whereof, the Aduenturers, & Planters of both Collonies, wilbe content, that a fourth parte of their Tobaccoes (w\u2122 shall yearely come home) shalbe sett aside & sould for publique vses, and out of y* proceed thereof shalbe ",
    "2634": "550 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  First payd & dischardged the Custome, due vppon the whole Quantitic (wt shalbe brought home,) w** Custome, shalbe after the rate of iijd p pound, as nowe it is rated and wilbe y* full Custome that can be requyred, although the Tobaceo should be sould after the rate of 6* p pound.  (29) Secondly out of the $proceed\u00a7 of the saide fourth parte, there shalbe farther yearely payd vnto hi[s] Ma\u2019 by waye of thanckfull retribution for his gratious fauo's\u201410000 1,  The whole remaynder of the proceed of this fowrth parte of Tobacco, shalble] First, for the defrayinge of the chardges of menadginge and ordringe this Contract.

And the Surplus, whateuer it bee shalbe bestowed Gin such manner as the Companies shall finde most fitt) for the supporte & aduancement of the Plantations.  And because it is doubted, that in regard of many difficulties, w\u2122 are allwaics in the settlinge of newe buissinesses, the proceed of the fourth parte, for y\u00b0 first yeare, may not amount to soe much as the propor\u00e9ons aboue. Itt is therefore desired, that for y* first yeare his Ma\" would be gratiously pleased to allowe out of y\u00b0 proceed of y* saide fourth pa\u00a7r\u00a7t{e]  First, as much as shall defraye the Custome, then 6000! more towarde@ the vsex aboue expressed, and then te accept of the remaynder that shalbe, although it should proue 10000\".

That the Tobacco to be brought in be consigned in one hand, viz of such officers as y\u00ae saide Company shall appoynt. And that the saide Company haue the sole menadging of the saide sale of Tobaccoe.  That the Aduenturers of each Plantation shall not be bound to bringe in any greate[7] Quantities of Tobaeco then themselues shall thinck good.  It is lykewise desired, that for recouery of all such debt\u00a2 as shall from tyme to tyme growe due to y* Companies by occasion of this Contract, the saide debt@ may be assigned ouer vnto the kinge, when & soe often as need shall require. ",
    "2635": "MAY, 1626 681  They likewise desire that there maye be inserted in the Contract, a Graunt & Coucnaunte from his Ma\u2018 against the grauntinge of lyeences to Retay- lers of Tobacco: Soe that y\u00b0 Sale thereof may remayne free as hetherto it hath done.  That his Mat'* be pleased to take a strickt course for the preuenting of all vndue bringinge in of Tobaceo by other meanes.
