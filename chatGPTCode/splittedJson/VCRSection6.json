    "1434": "JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 155  at the barre, to be ready for any service the Assembly shoulde comaund him. But forasmuche as men\u2019s affaires doe little prosper where God\u2019s service is neglected, all the Burgesses tooke their places in the Quire till a prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the Minister, that it would please God to guide and sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and the good of this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the intente that as we had begun at God Almighty, so we might proceed with awful and due respecte towards the Lieutenant, our most gratious and dread Soveraigne, all the Burgesses were intreatted to retyre themselves into the body of the Churche, which being done, before they were fully admitted, they were ealled in order and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it) tooke the oathe of Supremacy, and entred the Assembly. At Captaine Warde the Speaker tooke exception, as at one that without any Comis- sion or authority had seatted himselfe either upon the Companics, and then his Plantation would not be lawfull, or on Captain Martin\u2019s lande, and so he was but a limbe or member of him, and there could be but two Burgesses for all. So Captaine Warde was comanded to absent himselfe till such time as the Assembly had agreed what was fitt for him to doe. After muche debate, they resolved on this order following:  An order concluded by the General assembly concerning Captaine Warde, July 30th, 1619, at the opening of the said Assembly.  At the reading of the names of the Burgesses, Exception was taken against Captaine Warde as having planted here in Virginia without any authority or comission from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in Englande. But considering he had bene at so great chardge and paines to augmente this Colony, and adventured his owne person in the action, and since that time had brought home a good quantity of fishe, to relieve the Colony by waye of trade, and above all, because the Comission for authorising the General Assembly admitteth of two Burgesses out of every plantation without restrainte or exception, Upon all these considerations, the As- sembly was contented to admitt of him and his Licutenant (as members of their body and Burgesses) into their society, Provided, that the said Captaine Warde with all expedition, that is to saye between this and the nexte general assembly (all lawful impediments excepted), should procure from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in England a comission lawfully ",
    "1435": "156 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  to establish and plant himselfe and his Company as the Chiefis of other Plantations have done. And in case he doe neglect this he is to stande to the censure of the nexte general assembly. To this Captaine Warde, in the presence of us all, having given his consente and undertaken to per- forme the same was, together with his Lieutenant, by voices of the whole Assembly first admitted to take the oath of Supremacy, and then to make up their number and to sitt amongst them.  This being done, the Governor himselfe alledged that before we proceeded any further it behooved us to examine whither it were fitt, that Captaine Martin\u2019s Burgesses shoulde have any place in the Assembly, forasmuche as he hath a clause in his Patente which doth not onely exempte him from that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders which the great charter saith are to extende over the whole Colony, but also from diverse such lawes as we must be enforced to make in the General Assembly. That clause is as followeth: Item. That it shall and may be lawfull to and for the said Captain John Martin, his heyers, executours and assignes to governe and comaunde all suche person or persons as at this time he shall carry over with him, or that shalbe sente him hereafter, free from any comaunde of the Colony, excepte it be in ayding and assisting the same against any forren or domestical enemy.  Upon the motion of the Governor, discussed the same time in the assembly, ensued this order following:  An order of the General Assembly touching a clause in Captain Martin\u2019s Patent at James Citty, July 30, 1619.  After all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted into the house and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain Martin\u2019s Patent was produced by the Governor out of a Clause whereof it appeared that when the general assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for the whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole company and chuse whether they would obay the same or no, It was therefore ordered in Courte that the foresaid two Burgesses should withdraw themselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had made his personall appearance before them. At what time, if upon their motion, if he would be contente to quitte and give over that parte of his Patente, ",
    "1436": "JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 157  and contrary thereunto woulde submitte himsclfe to the general forme of governement as all others did, that then his Burgesses should be readmitted, otherwise they were to be utterly excluded as being spies rather than loyal Burgesses, because they had offered themselves to be assistant at the mak- ing of lawes which both themselves and those whom they represented might chuse whether they would obaye or not.  Then came there in a complainte against Captain Martin, that having sente his Shallop to trade for corne into the baye, under the commaunde of one Ensigne Harrison, the saide Ensigne should affirme to one Thomas Davis, of Paspaheighe, Gent. (as the said Thomas Davis deposed upon oathe,) that they had made a harde voiage, had they not mett with a Canoa coming out of a creeke where their shallop could not goe. For the Indians refusing to sell their Corne, those of the shallop entered the Canoa with their armes and tooke it by force, measuring out the eorne with a baskett they had into the Shallop and (as the said Ensigne Harrison saith) giving them satisfaction in copper beades and other trucking stuffe.  Hitherto Mr. Davys upon his oath.  Furthermore it was signified from Opochancano to the Governour that those people had complained to him to procure them justice. For which considerations and because suche outrages as this might breede danger and loss of life to others of the Colony which should have leave to trade in the baye hereafter, and for prevention of the like violenees against the In- dians in time to come, this order following was agreed on by the general assembly:  A second order against Captain Martin, at James cttty, July 80, 1619.  It was also ordered by tlie Assembly the same day in case Captaine Martin and the ging of his shallop would not thoroughly answere an accusation of an outrage committed gainst a certaine Conoa of Indians in the haye, that then it was thought reason (his Patent notwithstanding, the authority whereof he had in that case abused) he should from henceforth take leave of the Governour as other men, and should putt in security, that his people shall comitte no such outrage any more.  1282--3. 12  ",

These obstacles removed, the Speaker, who for a long time has bene ex- treame sickly, and therefore not able to passe through long harangues, delivered in briefe to the whole assembly the occasions of their meeting. Which done he read unto them the commission for establishing the Counsell of Estate and the general Assembly, wherein their duties were described to the life.  Having thus prepared them he read over unto them the greate Charter, or commission of privileges, orders and laws, sent by Sir George Yeardley out of Englande. Which for the more ease of the Committies, having divided into fower books, he read the former two the same forenoon for expeditions sake, a second time over, and so they were referred to the perusall of twoe Committies, which did reciprocally consider of either, and accordingly brought in their opinions. But some may here objecte to what ende we should presume to referre that to the examination of Committies which the Counsell and Company in England had already resolved to be perfect, and did expect nothing but our assente thereunto. To this we answere, that we did it not to the ende to correcte or controll anything therein contained, but onely in case we should finde ought not perfectly squaring with the state of this Colony or any lawe which did presse or binde too harde, that we might by waye of humble petition, seeke to have it redressed, especially because this great Charter is to bind us and our heyers for ever.

The second petition of the General assembly framed by the Committies out of the second book is. That the Treasurer and Company in England would be pleased with as muche convenient speed as may be to sende men hither to oceupie their landes belonging to the fower Incorporations, as well for their owne behoofe and proflitt as for the maintenance of the Counsel of Estate, who are nowe to their extream hindrance often drawen far from their private busines and likewise that they will have a care to sende tenants to the ministers of the fower Incorporations to manure their gleab, to the intente that all allowance they have allotted them of 200 G. a yeare may be more easily raised.  The thirde Petition humbly presented by this General Assembly to the Treasurer, Counsell and Company is, that it may plainly be expressed in the great Comission (as indeed it is not) that the antient Planters of both sortes, viz., suche as before Sir Thomas Dales\u2019 depart were come hither upon their owne chardges, and suche also as were brought hither upon the Companie\u2019s coste, maye have their second, third and more divisions suc- cessively in as lardge and free manner as any other Planters. Also that they wilbe pleased to allowe to the male children, of them and of all others begotten in Virginia, being the onely hope of a posterity, a single share a piece, and shares for their issues or for themselves, because that in a newe plantation it is not knowen whether man or woman be more necessary.

The fifte Petition is to beseeche the Treasurer, Counse'l and Company that, towards the erecting of the University and Colledge, they will sende, when they shall thinke it most convenient, workmen of al! sortes, fitt for that purpose,  The sixte and laste is, they wilbe pleased to change the savage name of Kiecowtan, and to give that Incorporation a new name.  These are the general Petitions drawen by the Comitties out of the two former bookes which the whole general assembly in maner and forme above sett downe doe most humbly offer up and present to the honourable con- struction of the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England.  These petitions thus concluded on, those twoe Comitties broughte me a reporte what they had observed in the two latter bookes, which was nothing else but that the perfection of them was suche as that they could finde nothing therein subject to exception, only the Governors particular opinion to my selfe in private hathe bene as touching a clause in the thirde booke, that in these doubtfull times between us and the Indians, it would behoove us not to make as lardge distances between Plantation as ten miles, but for our more strength ande security to drawe nearer together. At the same time, there remaining no farther scruple in the mindes of the Assembly touching the said great Charter of lawes, orders and priviledges, the Speaker putt the same to the question, and so it had both the gencral assent and the applause of the whole assembly, who, as they professed themselves in the first place most submissively thankful to almighty god, therefore so they commaunded the Speaker to returne (as nowe he doth) their due and hum- ble thankes to the Treasurer Counsell and company for so many priviledges and favours as well in their owne names as in the names of the who!e Colony whom they represented.

    "1441": "162 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  This being dispatched we fell once more debating of suche instructions given by the Counsell in England to several Governors as might be con- verted into lawes, the last whereof was the Establishment of the price of Tobacco, namely, of the best at 3d and the second at 18d the pounde. At the reading of this the Assembly thought good to send for Mr. Abraham Persey, the Cape marchant, to publishe this instruction to him, and to demaunde of him if he knewe of any impediment why it might not be admitted of? His answere was that he had not as yet received any suche order from the Adventurers of the in England. And notwithstanding he sawe the authority was good, yet was he unwilling to yield, till suche time as the Governor and Assembly had layd their commandment upon him, out of the authority of the foresaid Instructions as followeth:  By the General Assembly.  We will and require you, Mr. Abraham Persey, Cape Marchant, from this daye forwarde to take notice, that, according to an article in the Instruc- tions confirmed by the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in Englande at a general quarter courte, both by voices and under their hands and the Comon seall, and given to Sir George Yeardley, knight, this present governour, Decemb. 3, 1618, that you are bounde to accepte of the Tobacco of the Colony, either for commodities or upon billes, at three shillings the beste and the second sorte at 18d the punde, and this shalbe your sufficient dischardge.  James citty out of the said General Assembly, July 31, 1619.  At the same the Instructions convertible into lawes were referred to the consideration of the above named Committies, viz., the general Instructions to the first Committie and the particular Instructions to the second, to be returned by them into the assembly on Munday morning.  Sunday, Aug. 1. Mr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased. Munday, Aug. 2.  Captain John Martin (according to the sumons sent him on Fryday, July 30,) made his personall appearance at the barre, whenas the Speaker having first read unto him the orders of the Assembly that concerned him, ",
    "1442": "JULY $0, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 163  he pleaded lardgely for himself to them both and indevoured to answere some other thinges that were objected against his Patente. In fine, being demanded out of the former order whether he would quitte that clause of his Patent which (quite otherwise then Sir William Throck- morton\u2019s, Captain Christopher Lawnes and other men\u2019s patentes) exempt- eth himselffe and his people from all services of the Colonie excepte oncly in case of warre against a forren or domesticall enemie, His answere was negative, that he would not infringe any parte of his Patente. Where- upon it was resolved by the Assembly that his Burgesses should have no admittance.  To the second order his answere was affirmative, namely, that (his Patent notwithstanding) whensoever he should send in to the baye to trade, he would be contente to putt in security to the Governour for the good behaviour of his people towardes the Indians.  It was at the same time further ordered by the Assembly that the Speaker, in their names, should (as he nowe doth) humbly demaunde of the Treas- urer, Counsell and Company an exposition of this one clause in Captaine Martin\u2019s Patente namely, where it is saide That he is to enjoye his landes in as lardge and ample manner, to all intentes and purposes, as any lord of any manours in England dothe holde his grounde out of which some have collected that he might by the same graunte protecte men from paying their debts and from diverse other dangers of lawe. The least the Assembly can alledge against this clause is, that it is obscure, and that it is a thing impossible for us here to knowe the Prerogatives of all manours in Englande. The Assembly therefore humbly beseeches their lo?\u00ae* and the rest of that Honble house that in case they shall finde any thing in this or in any other parte of his graunte wherby that clause towards the conclusion of the great charter, (viz., that all grauntes aswell of the one sorte as of the other respectively, be made with equall favour, and graunts of like liberties and imunities as neer as may be, to the ende that all com- plainte of partiality and indifferency may be avoided,) might in any sorte be contradicted or the uniformity and equality of lawes and orders extend- ing over the whole Colony might be impeached, That they would be pleased to remove any such hindrance as may diverte out of the true course the free and publique current of Justice. ",
    "1443": "164 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  Upon the same ground and reason their lo?*, together with the rest of the Counsell and Company, are humbly besought by this general assembly that if in that other clause which exempteth the Captaine Martin and his people from all services of the Colony ete., they shall finde any resistance [to] that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders intended nowe by them to be established over the whole Colony, that they would be pleased to reforme it.  In fine, wheras Captaine Martin, for those ten shares allowed him for his personal adventure and for his adventure of \u00a370 besides, doth claim 500 acres a share, that the Treasurer, Counsell and Company woulde vouchsafe to give notice to the Governour here, what kinde of shares they meante he should have when they gave him his Patent.  The premisses about Captaine Martin thus resolved, the Committies appointed to consider what instructions are fitt to be converted into lawes, brought in their opinions, and first of some of the general instructions.  Here begin the lawes drawen out of the Instructions given by his Mat? Counsell of Virginia in England to my lo: la warre, Captain Argall and Sir George Yeardley, knight.  By this present General Assembly be it enacted that no injury or oppres- sion be wrought by the English against the Indians whereby the present peace might be disturbed and antient quarrells might be revived. And farther be it ordained that the Chicohomini are not to be excepted out of this lawe; untill either that suche order come out of Englande or that they doe provoke us by some newe injury.  Against Idienes, Gaming, drunkenes and excesse in apparell the Assembly hath enacted as followeth:  First, in detestation of Idlenes be it enacted, that if any man be founde to live as an Idler or renagate, though a freedman, it shalbe lawful for that Incorporation or Plantation to which he belongeth to appoint him a Mr to serve for wages, till he shewe apparant signes of amendment.  Against gaming at dice and Cardes be it ordained by this present assembly that the winner or winners shall lose all his or their winninges and both winners and loosers shall forfaite ten shillings a man, one ten shillings ",

Against drunkenness be it also decreed that if any private person be found culpable thereof, for the first time he is to be reprooved privatcly by the Minister, the second time publiquely, the thirde time to lye in boltes 12 howers in the house of the Provost Marshall and to paye his fee, and if he still continue in that vice, to undergo suche severe punishment as the Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to be inflicted on him. But if any officer offende in this crime, the first time he shall receive reprootf from the Governour, the second time he shall openly be reprcoved in the churehe by the minister, and the third time he shall first be comitted and then degraded. Provided it be understood that the Governor hath alwayes power to restore him when he shall in his discretion thinke fitte.  Against excesse in apparell that every man be cessed in the churche for all publique contributions, if he be unmarried according to his owne apparell, if he be married, aceording to his owne and his wives, or either of their apparell.  As touching the instruction of drawing some of the better disposed of the Indians to converse with our people and to live and labour amongst them, the Assembly who knowe well their dispositions thinke it fitte to enjoin, least to counsell those of the Colony, neither utterly to reject them nor yet to drawe them to come in. But in case they will of themselves come voluntarily to places well peopled, there to doe service in killing of Deere, fishing, beatting of Corne and other workes, that then five or six may be admitted into every such place, and no more, and that with the consente of the Governour. Provided that good guarde in the night be kept upon them for generally (though some amongst many may proove good) they are a most trecherous people and quickly gone when they have done a villany. And it were fitt a house were builte for them to lodge in aparte by themselves, and lone inhabitants by no meanes to entertain them.  Be it enacted by this present assembly that for laying a surer foundation of the conversion of the Indians to Christian Religion, eache towne, citty, Borrough, and particular plantation do obtaine unto themselves by just means a certine number of the natives\u2019 children to be educated by ",

As touching the busines of planting corne this present Assembly doth ordain that yeare by yeare all and every householder and householders have in store for every servant he or they shall keep, and also for his or their owne persons, whether they have any Servants or no, one spare barrell of corne, to be delivered out yearly, either upon sale or exchange as need shall require. For the neglecte of which duty he shalbe subjecte to the censure of the Governor and Counsell of Estate. Provided always that the first yeare of every newe man this lawe shall not be of force.  About the plantation of Mulbery trees, be it enacted that every man as he is seatted upon his division, doe for seven yeares together, every yeare plante and maintaine in growte six Mulberry trees at the least, and as many more as he shall think conveniente and as his vurtue and Industry shall move him to plante, and that all suche persons as shall negleete the yearly planting and maintaining of that small proportion shalbe subjecte to the censure of the Governour and the Counsell of Estate.  Be it farther enacted as concerning Silke-flaxe, that those men that are upon their division or setled habitation doe this next yeare plante and dresse 100 plantes, which being founde a comodity, may farther be in- creased. And whosoever do faill in the performance of this shalbe subject to the punishment of the Governour and Counsell of Estate.  For hempe also both English and Indian and for English flax and Anniseeds, we do require and enjoine all householders of this Colony that have any of those seeds to make tryal thereof the nexte season.  Moreover be it enacted by this present Assembly, that every householder doe yearly plante and maintaine ten vines untill they have attained to the art and experience of dressing a Vineyard either by their owne industry or by the Instruction of some Vigneron. And that upon what penalty soever the Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to impose upon the neglecters of this acte. ",
    "1446": "JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 167  Be it also enacted that all necessary tradesmen, or so many as need shall require, suche as are come over since the departure of Sir Thomas Dale, or that shall hereafter come, shall worke at their trades for any other man, each one being payde according to the quality of his trade and worke, to be estimated, if he shall not be contented, by the Governor and officers of the place where he worketh.  Be it further ordained by this General Assembly, and we doe by these presents enacte, that all contractes made in England between the owners of the lande and their Tenants and Servantes which they shall sende hither, may be caused to be duely performed, and that the offenders be punished as the Governour and Counsell of Mstate shall thinke Just and convenient.  Be it established also by this present Assembly that no crafty or advanta- gious means be suffered to be put in practise for the inticing awaye the Tenants or Servants of any particular plantation from the place where they are seatted. And that it shalbe the duty of the Governor and Coun- sell of Estate most severely to punish both the seducers and the seduced, and to returne these latter into their former places.  Be it further enacted that the orders for the Magazin lately made be exactly kepte, and that the Magazin be preserved from wrong and sinister practises, and that according to the orders of courte in Englande all To- baeco and sasafras be brought by the Planters to the Cape marchant till suche time as all the goods nowe or heretofore sent for the Magazin be taken off their hands at the prices agreed on. That by this meanes the same going for Englande with one hande the price thercof may be uphelde the better. And to that ende that all the whole Colony may take notice of the last order of Courte made in Engiande and all those whom it con- cerneth may knowe howe to observe it, we holde it fitt to publishe it here for a lawe among the rest of our lawes. \u2018The which order is as followeth:  Upon the 26 of October, 1618, it was ordered that the Magazin should continue during the terme formerly prefixed and that certaine abuses now complained of should be reformed and that for preventing of all Imposi- tions save the allowance of 25 in the hundred proffitt, the Governor shall have an invoice as well as the Cape Marchant, that if any abuse in the sale of the goods be offered, wee upon Intelligence and due examination ",
    "1447": "168 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  thereof, shall see it correctede. And for incouragement of particular hundreds, as Smythe\u2019s hundred, Martin\u2019s hundred, Lawnes\u2019 hundred, and the like, it is agreed that what comodoties are reaped upon anie of these General Colonies, it shalbe lawefull for them to returne the same to their owne adventurers. Provided that the same comodity be of their owne growing, without trading with any other, in one entyre lumpe, and not dispersed and that at the determination of the jointe stocke, the goods then remaining in the Magazin shalbe bought by the said particular Colonies before any other goods which shall be sente by private men. And it was moreover ordered that if the lady la warre, the Lady Dale, Captain Bar- grave and the rest, would unite themselves into a settled Colony they might be capable of the same priviledges that are graunted to any of the foresaid hundreds. Hitherto the order.  All the general Assembly by voices concluded not only the acceptance and observation of this order, but of the Instruction also to Sir George Yeardley next preceding the same. Provided first, that the Cape Mar- chant do aceepte of the Tobacco of all and everie the Planters here in Virginia, either for Goods or upon billes of Exchange at three shillings the pounde the beste, and 18d the second sorte. Provided also that the billes be only payde in Englande. Provided, in the third place, that if any other besides the Magazin have at any time any necessary comodity which the Magazine dothe wante, it shall and may be lawfull for any of the Colony to buye the said necessary comodity of the said party, but upon the termes of the Magazin viz: allowing no more gaine then 25 in the hundred, and that with the leave of the Governour. Provided lastly, that it may be lawfull for the Governor to give leave to any Mariner, or any other person that shall have any suche necessary comodity wanting to the Magazin to carrie home for Englande so muche Tobaceo or other naturall comodities of the Country as his Customers shall pay him for the said necessary comodity or comodities. And to the ende we may not only persuade and incite men, but inforce them also thoroughly and loyally to aire their Tobacco before they bring it to the Magazine, be it enacted, and by these presents we doe enacte, that if upon the Judgement of fower sufficient men of any incorporation where the Magazine shall reside, (having first taken their oaths to give true sentence, twoe whereof to be chosen by the Cape Marchant and twoe by the Incorporation), any Tobacco whatsoever ",

Hitherto suche lawes as were drawen out of the Instructions.  Tuesday, Aug. 8, 1619.  This morning a thirde sorte of lawes (suche as might proceed out of every man\u2019s private conceipt) were read and referred by halves to the same comitties which were from the beginning.  This done, Captaine William Powell presented to the Assembly a petition to have justice against a lewde and trecherous servante of his who by false accusation given up in writing to the Governor sought not only to gett him deposed from his government of James citty and utterly (according to the Proclamation) to be degraded from the place and title of a Captaine, but to take his life from him also. And so out of the said Petition sprang this order following:  Captaine William Powell presented a pettition to the general! Assem- bly against one Thomas Garnett, a servant of his, not onely for extreame neglect of his business to the great loss and prejudice of the said Captaine, and for openly and impudently abusing his house, in sight both of Master and Mistress, through wantonnes with a woman servant of theirs, a wid- dowe, but also for falsely accusing him to the Governor both of Drunken- nes and Thefte, and besides for bringing all his fellow servants to testific on his side, wherein they justly failed him. It was thought fitt by the general assembly (the Governour himself giving sentence), that he should stand fower dayes with his eares nayled to the Pillory, viz: Wednesday, Aug. 4th, and so ikewise Thursday, fryday, and Satturday next following, and every of those dayes should be publiquely whipped. Now, as touch- ing the neglecte of his worke, what satisfaction ought to be made to his Mr for that is referred to the Governour and Counsell of Estate.  The same morning the lawes abovewritten, drawen out of the instruc- tions, were read, and one by onc thoroughly examined, and then passed once again the general consente of the whole Assembly.  This afternoon the comitties brought in a reporte, what they had done as concerning the thirde sorte of Jawes, the discussing whereof spente the residue of that daye. Excepte onely the consideration of a peititon of ",

This Petition of Mr. Rolfes\u2019 was thought fitt to be referred to the Counsell of State.  Wednesday, Aug. 4th.  This daye (by reason of extream heat, both paste and likely to ensue and by that meanes of the alteration of the healthes of diverse of the general Assembly) the Governour, who himself also was not well, resolved should be the last of this first session; so in the morning the Speaker (as he was required by the Assembly) redd over ali the lawes and orders that had formerly passed the house, to give the same yett one reviewe more, and to see whether there were any thing to be amended or that might be excepted againste. This being done, the third sorte of lawes which I am nowe coming to sett downe, were read over [and] thoroughly discussed, which, together with the former, did now passe the laste and finall consente of the General Assembly.

No man, without leave of the Governor, shall kill any Neatt cattle whatsoever, young or olde, especially kine, Heyfurs or cow-calves, and shalbe careful to perserve their steers and oxen, and to bring them to the plough and such profitable uses, and without having obtained leave as ",

Be it enacted by this present assembly that whatsoever servant hath heretofore or shall hereafter contracte himselfe in England, either by way of Indenture or otherwise, to serve any Master here in Virginia and shall afterward, against his said former contracte depart from his Mr without leave, or, being once imbarked shall abandon the ship he is appointed to come in, and so, being lefte behinde, shall putt himselfe into the service of any other man that will bring him hither, that then at the same servant\u2019s arrival here, he shall first serve out his time with that Mr that brought him hither and afterward also shall serve out his time with his former Mr according to his covenant.  Here ende the lawes.  All these lawes being thus concluded and consented to as aforesaid Captaine Henry Spellman was called to the barre to answere to certaine misdemeanors layde to his chardge by Robert Poole, interpretour, upon his oath (whose examination the Governor sente into England in the Prosperus), of which accusations of Poole some he acknowledged for true, but the greattest part he denyed. Whereupon the General Assembly having throughly heard and considered his speaches, did constitute this order following against him:  Aug. 4th, 1619.  This day Captaine Henry Spelman was convented before the General Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole, Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman and Opochaneano at Poole\u2019s meeting with him in Opochancano\u2019s courte. Poole chardgeth him he spake very unreverently and maliciously against this present Governor, whereby the honour and dignity of his place and person, and so of the whole Colonie, might be brought into contempte, by which meanes what mischiefs might ensue from the Indians by disturbance of the peace or otherwise, may easily be conjectured. Some thinges of this relation Spelman confessed, but the most parte he denyed, excepte onely one matter of importance, and that was that he hade informed ",
    "1454": "JULY 80, 31, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 175  Opochancano that within a yeare there would come a Governor greatter then this that nowe isin place. By which and by other reportes it seemeth he hath alienated the minde of Opochancano from this present Governour, and brought him in much disesteem, both with Opochancano and the Indians, and the whole Colony in danger of their slippery designes.  The general assembly upon Poole\u2019s testimony onely not willing to putt Spelman to the rigour and extremity of the !awe which might, perhaps both speedily and deservedly, have taken his life from him (upon the witness of one whom he muche excepted against) were pleased, for the present, to censure him rather out of that his confession above written then out of any other prooffe. Several and sharpe punishments were pronounced against him by diverse of the Assembly, But in fine the whole courte by voices united did encline to the most favorable, which was that for this misdemeanour he should first be degraded of his title of Captaine, at the head of the troupe, and should be condemned to performe seven years service to the Colony in the nature of Interpreter to the Governour.  This sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more of the Savage then of the Christian, muttered certaine wordes to himselfe neither shewing any remorse for his offenses, nor yet any thankfulness to the Assembly for theire sofavourable censure, which he at one time or another (God\u2019s grace not wholly abandoning him) might with some one service have been able to have redeemed.  This day also did the Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Argall\u2019s towne, present a petition to the general assembly to give them an absolute dis- charge from certain bondes wherein they stand bound to Captain Samuell Argall for the payment of 600\u2019 and to Captain William Powell, at Captaine Argall\u2019s appointment, for the payment of 50'\" more. To Captaine Argall for 15 skore acres of wooddy ground, called by the name of Argal\u2019s towne or Paspaheigh; to Captaine Powell in respect of his paines in clearing the grounde and building the houses, for which Captaine Argal ought to have given him satisfaction. Nowe, the general assembly being doubtful whether they have any power and authority to discharge the said bondes, doe by these presents (at the Instance of the said Inhabitants of Pas- paheigh, alias Martin\u2019s hundred people) become most humble sutours to ",
    "1455": "176 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England that they wilbe pleased to gett the said bondes for 600!\u201d to be cancelled; forasmuche as in their great comission they have expressly and by name appointed that place of Paspaheigh for parte of the Governour\u2019s lande. And whereas Captain William Powell is payde his 50 which Captain Argall enjoined the saide Inhabitantes to presente him with, as parte of the bargaine, the general assembly, at their intreaty, do become sutours on their behalfe, that Captaine Argall, by the Counsell and Company in England, may be com- pelled either to restore the said 50'\u201d from thence, or else that restitution thereof be made here out of the goods of the said Captaine Argall.  The last acte of the Generall Assembly was a contribution to gratifie their oiticers, as followeth: Aug. 4th, 1619.  It is fully agreed at this general Assembly that in regard of the great paines and labour of the Speaker of this Assembly (who not onely first formed the same Assembly and to their great case and expedition reduced all matters to be treatted of into a ready method, but also his indisposition notwithstanding wrote or dictated all orders and other expedients and is yet to write severall bookes for all the Generall Incorporations and planta- tions both of the great charter, and of all the lawes) and likewise in respecte of the diligence of the Clerke and sergeant, officers thereto belonging, That every man and manservant of above 16 yeares of age shall pay into the handes and Custody of the Burgesses of every Incorporation and plantation one pound of the best Tobacco, to be distributed to the Speaker and likewise to the Clerke and sergeant of the Assembly, according to their degrees and rankes, the whole bulke whereof to be delivered into the Speaker\u2019s handes, to be divided accordingly. And in regarde the Provost Marshall of James citty hath also given some attendance upon the said General Assembly, he is also to have a share out of the same. And this is to begin to be gathered the 24th of February nexte.  In conclusion, the whole Assembly comaunded the Speaker (as nowe he doth) to present their humble excuse to the Treasurer Counsell and Company in England for being constrained by the intemperature of the weather and the falling sick of diverse of the Burgesses to breake up so abruptly\u2014before they had so much as putt their lawes to the ingrossing. ",
    "1456": "JULY 30, 31, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 177  This they wholly comited to the fidelity of their speaker, who therin (his conscience telles him) hath done the parte of an honest man, otherwise he would be easily founde out by the Burgesses themselves, who with all expedition are to have so many bookes of the same lawes as there be both Incorporations and Plantations in the Colony.  In the seconde place, the Assembly doth most humbly crave pardon that in so shorte a space they could bring their matter to no more perfec- tion, being for the present enforced to sende home titles rather then lawes, Propositions rather then resolutions, Attemptes then Acchievements, hoping their courtesy will accepte our poor endevour, and their wisedome wilbe ready to supporte the weakness of this little flocke.  Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech the said Treas- urer, Counsell and Company, that albeit it belongeth to them onely to allowe or to abrogate any lawes which we shall here make, and that it is their right so to doe, yet that it would please them not to take it in ill parte if these lawes which we have now brought to light, do passe currant and be of force till suche time as we may knowe their farther pleasure out of Englande: for otherwise this people (vho nowe at length have gotten the raines of former servitude into their owne swindge) would in shorte time growe so insolent, as they would shake off all government, and there would be no living among them.  Their last humble suite is, that the said Counsell and Company would be pleased, so soon as they shall finde it convenient, to make good their promise sett downe at the conclusion of their commission for establishing the Counsel of Estate and the General Assembly, namely, that they will give us power to allowe or disallowe of their orders of Courte, as his Majesty hath given them power to allowe or to reject our lawes.  In sume Sir George Yeardley, the Governour prorogued the said General Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to fall out this present yeare of 1619, and in the mean season dissolved the same.

The Governot 8\" George Yeardley, having taken exceeding pains for the setling of al things \u00a7matters\u00a7 in order in Virginia, & for laying the foundation of a regular State, according to his Instructions & other Directions; hath sodainly fallen into a violent resolution of quitting his Place, (grounding himself upon an erro\u2019,) & ceaseth not by all his letters publick & private to impor- tune it. The erro is, that he conceiveth St Thomas Smyth still to be Treasuro\u2019, w\" his Alderman Deputie: & supposeth that he shalbe there ",

The report hereof coming (as dooth now appeare) to 8\" G Yeardley, (for his owne brother was present), hath bred in him this discontent, & hastie resolution, not to serve under his controll, whose hatred \u00a7though causeles\u00a7 was so strong, as to break thorough the \u00a7nue\u00a7 bounds of a publick reecon- ciliation.

By my fees I must maintaine my selfe; w** the Gouern\u2019 telles me, may this yeare amounte to a matter of 300\" sterling; wherof fifty I doe owe to himselfe, and I pray God the remainder may amounte to a hundred more. As yet I haue gotten nothing, saue onely Gf I may speak it wout boasting, a general reputation of integrity, for hauing spoken freely to all matters, according to my conscience; and as neare as I could discerne, done every man right.  As touching the quality of this country, three thinges there bee, w*> in fewe yeares may bring this Colony to perfection; the English plough, Vineyards, & Cattle. For the first, there be many grounds here cleared by the Indians to our handes, w** being muche worne out, will beare no more of their corne, w*\" requireth an extrordinary deale of sappe & sub- stance to nourish it: but of our graine of all sortes it will beare great abundance. We have had this yeare a plentifull cropp of English wheat, tho the last haruest 1618. was onely shed upon the stubble, and so selfe- sowne, w'out any other manurance. In Iuly last so soon as we had reaped this selfe-sowen wheate, we sett Indian corne upon the same grounde, w is come up in great abundance; and so by this meanes we are to enjoye two crops in one yeare from off one & the same fielde. The ",
    "1500": "SEPTEMBER 80, 1619 221  greattest labour we haue yet bestowed upon English wheate, hath bene, upon newe broken up groundes, one ploughing onely & one harrowing, far shorte of the Tilthe used in Christendome, w** when we shall haue ability enough to performe we shall produce miracles out of this earthe. Vines here are in suche abundance, as wheresoeuer a man treads, they are ready to embrace his foote. I haue tasted here of a great black grape as big as a Damascin, that hath a true Muscatell-taste; the vine wherof now spending itselfe euen to the topps of high trees, if it were reduced into a vineyard, and there domesticated, would yeild incomparable fruite. The like or a better taste haue I founde in a lesser sorte of black grapes. White grapes also of great excellency I haue hearde to be in the country; but they are very rare, nor did I euer see or taste of them. For cattle, they do mightily increase here, both kine, hogges, & goates, and are much greater in stature, then the race of them first brought out of Eng- land. No lesse are our horses and mares likely to multiply, w* proove of a delicate shape, & of as good spirite & metall. All our riehes for the present doe consiste in Tobacco, wherein one man by his owne labour hath in one yeare, raised to himselfe to the value of 200\" sterling; and another by the meanes of sixe seruants hath cleared at one crop a thou- sand pound english. These be true, yet indeed rare examples, yet possi- ble to be done by others. Our principall wealth (I should haue said) consisteth in seruants: but they are chardgeable to be furnished w'* armes, apparell, & bedding, and for their transportation, and casuall both at sea, & for their first yeare coMfionly at lande also: but if they escape, they prooue very hardy, and sound able men.  Nowe that yo\" lo may knowe, we are not the veriest beggers in the worlde, our Cowe-keeper here of Iames citty on Sundayes goes acowterd all in freshe flaming silkes and a wife of one that in England had professed the black arte not of a scholler but of a collier of Croydon, weares her rough beuer hatt w* a faire perle hattband, and a silken suite therto correspe- Se\u00a7ndent. But to leaue the Populace, and to come higher, the Gouerno\u2122 here, who at his first coming, besides a great deale of worth in his person, brought onely his sworde w* him, was at his late being in London, together w his lady, out of his meer gettings here, able to disburse very near three thousand pound\u00e9 to furnishe himselfe for his voiage. And once  w'in seuen yeares, I am persuaded (absit invidia verbo) that the Gouerno\u2122 1282\u201423 16 ",

All this not w'standing, I may say of my selfe, that when I was the last yeare wtt yo\" lo? at Middleborough, si mens non laeua fuisset, I might haue gone to the Hagh w you, and founde my selfe there nowe in far better company, w*\" indeed is the soule of this life, and might haue bene deeply ingrafted into yo\" lo\u201d seruice, w** since I haue a thousand times affected in vaine.

At my first coming hither the solitary vncouthnes of this place, compared w\u2018* those partes of Christendome or Turky where I had bene; and likewise my being sequestred from all occurrents and passages w\u00b0 are so rife there, did not a little vexe me. And yet in these fiue moneths of my continuance here, there haue come at one time or another eleuen saile of ships into this riuer, but fraighted more w* igno- rance, then wt any other marchandize. At length being hardned to this custome of abstinence from curiosity, I am resolued wholly to minde my busines here, and nexte after my penne, to haue some good book alwayes in store, being in solitude the best and choicest company. Besides among these Christall riuers, & odoriferous woods I doe escape muche expense, envye, contempte, vanity, and vexation of minde. Yet Good my lorde, haue a little compassion upon me, and be pleased to sende me, what pampletts and relations of the Interim since I was w\" you, as yo\" lo? shall thinke good, directing the same (if you please) in a boxe to M Ralfe Yeardley Apothecary (brother to Sir George Yeardley our gouer- nour) dwelling at the signe of the Hartychoke in great Woodstreet, to be sente to me by the first, together wt\u201d his brothers thinges. This pacquett I deliuered to one Marmaduke Rayner, an Englishman, who goes inter- tained as Pilott in this Flemishe man of warre. If he come to yo? lo\u00ae, as he hathe promised, he wilbe the fittest messenger.

",
    "1521": "242 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  These principall men being at James Citie, Cap** William Epps (who commandeth Smythes Hundred Company) was arraigned (as neere as might be) according to the lawdable Lawes of England, for killing one Captaine Edward Roecroft als Stallenge. He came hether from the North Colony in a shipp of S' flerdinando Gorges (as he sayd) for some necessaries w he wanted; and to coast along the shoare to fynd and discover what Harbo\u2122 and riu9s he could: but through neglect of the M* of the shipp and others she was forced a ground in a storme neere Newports Newes, and there sprang so greate a leake, that he could not carry her back againe. This myschance happened through vneivill and vnmanly word\u00a2 yrged by Stallenge (there being no ficedent malice) wt w Captaine Epps being much moved did strike him on the heade w a sword Sin the$ skabberd @ such an vnfortunate blowe, that w'tin 2. daies he died. The Jury (whereof Capt Lawne was foreman a discreete and vnderstanding man) hearing the Evidence, found him guilty of Manslaughter by Chaunce meddley. The Governo\u2122 fynding him (though young) yet a pper civill gent, and of good hopes, not long after restored him to his Command.  Captaine Henry Spelman being aceused by Robte Poole (one of the inter- preto\u2122 of the Indian language) of many crimes w might be pliudiciall to the State in generall, and to every mans safety in pticular, receiued Censure at this generall Assembly. But the Governo\u2122 hoping he might redeeme his fault being \u00a7pceeding\u00a7 much of Childishe ignorance, pdoned the piinishmt [1] vpon hope of amendm*. In triall whereof he was yin- ploied as interpreto\u2122 to Patawamack to trade for Corne.  Captaine Ward in his shipp went to Monahigon in the No: Colony in May, and returned the latter end of July, w\u2018 fishe w\u2122 he caught there. He [He] brought but a smale quantitie, by reason he hadd but little salte. There were some Plymouth shipps where he harbored, who made greate store of fishe, w% is farr larger then New-land-fishe.  The George was sent by the Cape Marchant (w'* the Governo\u2122 consent) to New-found-land to trade and buy fishe for the better releif of the Colony and to make triall of that passage. One other reason (as I take it) was, for that the Magazin was well stoored w* goode, it was some what doubtfull, wheth? a shipp would be sent to carry home the cropp so sone as the George might vpon her returne back. She departed hence about the 9 of July, and arriued here againe about the 10: of Septemb\"\u2122. She ",
    "1522": "JANUARY, 1619/20 243  made her passage to Newfound-land in less then 3. weekes, and was at the banck amongst the french fishermen in 14. daics. She came back + hether againe in 3. week\u00a2, wt bare wynd\u00a2, and brought so much fishe as will make a saving voyadge, w\u2122, besid\u20ac the greate releif, giveth much content to the wholl Colony.  The Sturgeon shipp and the Triall departed hence togeth? about the fiue of July. M*\u2122 Pountys hath taken greate paines in fishing, and toward Michellmas (the weather being somewhat temperate) made some good sturgeon. He hopeth by the spring to be better fitted, w\u00ae Cellars and houses, and to do some good therein.  The Cattle in the Triall came exceeding well, and gaue the Colony much ioy and greate incouragem'. Both they horses and Mares wilbe very vendible here a long tyme, the Colony increasing w people as of late.  About the latter end of August, a Dutch man of Warr of the burden of a 160 tues arriued at Point-Comfort, the Comando'\u2122 name Capt Jope, his Pilott for the West Indies one Mt Marmaduke an Englishman. They mett wt the Tr\u00e9r in the West Indyes, and determyned to bold consort shipp hetherward, but in their passage lost one the other. He brought not any thing but 20. and odd Negroes, w the Governo\u2019 and Cape Marchant bought for vietualle (whereof he was in greate need as he yitended) at the best and easyest rat\u00a2 they could. He hadd a lardge and ample Cofiiyssion from his Excellency to range and to take purchase in the West Indyes.  Three or 4. daies after the Tr\u00e9r arriued.

Autograph Letter, Signed List of Records No. 156 Most worthy knight, After my sicknesses and miseries past, the Bona noua hath brought me in particular one singular and cordial comfort namely the newes of your being elected Treasurer: for nowe I am confident, that what ",
    "1529": "250 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  seruice soeuer I shall indeuour for the publique shall come to that hand wt knowes howe to value it, and will not onely accepte, but esteem it. The defect is (w\u00ae makes me sigh) that my sufficiencies from hence (heu quantum est in rebus inane!) cannot in the thousand parte answere yours euery way so complete, out of England. And though I had it in my person, yet the place so newly inhabited wantes many helpes, wherwt\u00ae those ciuiler partes doe abounde. Howbeit this yeare to come (for the last was full of infirmities in all kindes) so it please God to con- tinue my health as it is, being neuer more perfect in any place wheresoeuer 1 haue remained, I will rouze up my spirits to doe all that may be possible. Neither shall the vneertainty of my being continued, or by some newe gouernour thrust out of my place, any whitt dismay me from performance of my duty for the Interim; for that is a stroke, though many times vnjust and cruell, for w there is no sense. In this dispatche I haue sente you enclosed in a letter of mine to the Counsell and Company, a copie of a warrant from the Gouern\u2019\u2122: and Counsell here, for establishing my fees, according as it was there ordered in courte, before my coming awaye. Herein (as all of them can be my witnesses) I was not mine owne caruer at all; but they in [1] mine absence, and w\u201cout my suggestion, did order mine allowance, as appeareth in the same copie. For the first whole yeare from the time my comission was deliuered me, I receiued not a farthing, and since that, very little, being faine to trust the most of those I doe seruice for. If the Company shalbe pleased to confirme vnto me that, w* all men of reason here do thinke to be but reasonable, I shall esteem both my hazard and my paines well bestowed, although, do what I ean, I feare me, that at my three yeares ende I shall skarce make a sauing voiage. In suma sumard, whatsoeuer they in their wisdom and bounty shall thinke fitte to allotte me I will rest contented.  Now in answere to your letter by the same ship. Your loue I do most thankfully acknowledge; and I thinke Sir George Yeardley will not deny, but he hath still cause to affect me euery day more and more. To that noble Earle I am deeply bound, who cannot but testifie on my behalfe, that when he employed me in his owne particular seruice I performed it fully to his minde, and aboue his expectation, and will hope to do the like, if ever I shall haue the honour to serue him againe. As it hath bene your indeuour to maintaine his lo\u201d good fauour toward\u00a2 Sir George Yeardley, ",
    "1530": "FANUARY 18, 1619/20 251  so (as you will perceiue by somewhat that comes in this dispatche) it hath + bene my care to nourish Sir George his duc respect. and worthy seruice towards his lo\u201d, and this also out of regard to the good of [24] Virginia. It would grieue me, that any erro\u2019 or disaster should haue any power to worke any contrary effecte. But you knowe that humanii est errare, and disasters what wisedome ean preuent? If his lo\u201d be offended in ought, it wilbe in respect of his more then ordinary affection towards Captain Argall, whose faultes Sir George was bounde by comission, and for the saluing of his owne reputation also, to discouer. Sir George Yeardley, I thinke, would not robb Captaine Argall of my lordes loue, for he hath in him to deserue muche; nor would he haue his lo? to haue spent so muche loue upon any man in vaine; but onely doth wishe that Captain Argall being riche, a Bachelour, and deuoid of chardge, would not so excessively * intende his owne thrifte. As touching Sir George his intereepting of my letters, his lo? I knowe (so noble is he) will not be implacable. And on the other side, I knowe not howe he will interpret that w\u00ae hath bene written concerning the Treasurer (w\u2122 Argall called his ship, while she was here) or concerning Spelmans vnaduised using of his lo\u201d* name to Opo- chancano. Meane while in the dangers wherein the Colony stood, Sir George thought himselfe vnworthy of a remedy, vnlessc he had sett dewne the truth of the case. What tempestes that answere of his by the Diana, and those other letters then and since haue raised in your court, I doe almost fear to think of. Without his comandement I did nothing [2] and that w** I did, he viewed and reuiewed still to a syllable. All w\u00ae upon the sending away of this dispatch we throughly perused, and he constantly auowes and Justifies euery iota and title. Jacta est alea, and some body must run the hazard of it. But if we be blamed for doing part of our duty, then what should we haue bene, if we had done all? All that I can say is, that whatsoever errours of mine be represented back hither (for in the distemper I was ia, I could not ehuse, but coihitte some) I shall be more willing to amende, then euer I was to comitte, and shall honour them most, that read me my lesson most roundly. And whosoeuer do so, shall in my conceipte do far better, then those others (who they were, 1 knowe not) that by the Marigolde putt this gouernour for the tine (whenas I serued him w'' the greatest fidelity and zeale that was possible) into so many violent needles Jelousies against me, which notw standing  * ",

And you shall well perceiue, howe I haue concurred with you to close up the breache, w** was in danger to haue growen wyder. So haue I ever since my coming hither performed the parte of a true friend, and that for the publique good, wherin I pray god, we may all haue Joye.

This seeret I would not putt into \u00a7any\u00a7$ hand but yours, nor into yours, but onely for that intent. I am to confident of your true worth, as I dare putt my life into your handes, and therfore this, w I hold not much inferiour. By the Bona noua I purpose to sende you copies of suche graunts of lande, as we shall haue passed to the ende, that if you like not the forme, you may be pleased to reforme it. If you receiued Sir George his dispatehe by the Prosperous I would beseech you to viewe the general petition $against Captaine Argall\u00a7 of those nine of James citty, \u00a7contained in one sheet\u00a7 and to compare the original w\u201c the copie sent you nowe in Sir George his boxe, and if you finde neuer so little difference between them \u00a7though but a worde\u00a7 that you would vouchsafe to giue me notice by the first, for it may concerne me. You may best doe it by correcting the said copie by the original, and sending it back againe. More time I will not presume to rob you of, that haue so many better wayes to employe it.

Of which houses, to be raised in due and whole- some places, each shall be sixteene foot broad within, and nine score foot long, (vnlesse it seeme good to diuide that length into two houses:) And in each of them shall be set vp all along on the one side, fiue and twenty Bedsteads of foure foot broad, sixe foot long, and two foot height from the ground in equall distance, and with partitions of Boords betweene them: And there shall be raised in each of th\u00ae in conuenient places, fiue Chimnies.

The Fourth commodity recommended, is Timpsr of all sorts, with Masts, Plancks, and Boords, for prouisions of shipping, and sundry other Materials of much vse and benefit. And to the ease and encrease of diuers of those works, prouision is now sent, for the erecting of Sawing- Milles, which may fill the whole Colony also with Plancks and Boords, to their great ease and helpe in setting vp their Buildings. The fifth, is SILKE, for which that Countrey is exceeding proper, hauing innumerable store of Mulbery trees of the best. For the setting vp of which commodity, his Maiesty hath been graciously pleased, now the second time (the former hauing miscarried) to bestow vpon the Company plenty of Silk-worme-feed of his owne store, being the best to be had; which together with such other, as from other places we could procure, we haue sent to you by the DVTY, at a seasonable time of the yere; requiring the same to be dispersed amongst the Colony, with order for the vsing therof, and especially to keep the Wormes from the aire of Tobacco, which is mortall to them. he sixth is Vines, whereof the Countrey yeeldeth naturally great store, and of diuers sorts, which by culture will bee brought to excellent perfection. For the effecting whereof, diuers skilfull Vignerons heretofore, and some now are sent, with store also from hence of Vine-plants of the best sort. And here by the way we aduise and desire, that Men of those Sciences, which are not naturall to vs, be extraordinarily cherished and encouraged in their workes: seeing if they should faile, it would be difficult to supply them. The last commodity, but not of least importance for health, is Saur: the workes whereof hauing been lately suffered to decay; we now intending to restore in so great plenty, as not onely to serue the Colony for the present, but as is hoped, in short. time, the great fishings on those Coasts (a matter of inestimable aduancement. to the Colony) doe vpon mature deliberation ordaine as followeth: First, that you the Gouernour and Councell, doc chuse out of the Tenants for the Company, 20. fit persons to be imployed in Salt workes, which are to be renewed in Smiths Iland, where they were before; as also in taking of Fish there, for vse of the Colony, as in former time was also done. These 20. shall be furnished out at the first, at the charges of the Company, with all implements and instruments necessary for those workes. They shall haue also assigned to each of them, for ",
    "1562": "280 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  their oceupation or vse, 50. acres of Land, within the same Iland, to be the Land of the Company. The one moyty of Salt, Fish, and profits of the Land, shall be for the Tenants, and the other for vs the Company, to be deliuered into our Store: and this contract shall be to continue for fiue yeeres. Wee doe also hereby grant and ordaine, that if any of the old Burroughs, or other particular Plantations, shall be pleased to coneurre in the same workes of making Sali, and taking Fish, they shall be admitted thereunto to the number of twenty persons or vnder, for euery Burrough or Plantation, with the like Grants as before, & with the same Diuisions of profit, betweene them and their Landlords, as is before set downe betweene the Company and their Tenants. These being the commodities (for Corne and Cattell we passe ouer, being onely for sustenance of the people) which we desire to haue set vp with all care and diligence, as well for necessary vse and profit, as for the honour and reputation of the Countrey and Colony; and for the aduancing of which, we haue spared neither care nor cost, which on our parts was requisite to our best vnderstandings: It remaineth, that we earnestly pray and desire you, that you also on your parts correspond with vs in the like. And if any thing (as in so manifold businesse) shall happen on our behalfe, to haue been omitted or vnprouided, that you endeuour to supply it with all sueh helpe as may there be had: For vnworthy he were to be a member of that body, that would not lend his hand to the setting vp of workes so necessary and profitable, and whereof himselfe may in short time be a partaker. And whatsoeuer in that kind shall bee done through our desire, we assure you, shall be acknowledged and recompenced by vs to their iust content. Gzaen in a great and generall Court held for Virginia, the 17. day of May, 1620. and in the yeere of the Raigne of our Soueraigne Lord Lames, by the grace of God, King of England, Seotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &e. viz. of England, Scotland, Franee and Ireland the eighteenth, and of Scotland the three and fiftieth.

By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia  After the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Almighty God to suffer the great Enemy of ail good Actions and his Instruments, to encounter and interrupt, to oppresse and keepe weake, this noble Action for the planting of Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It hauing pleased him now contrarily of his especiall great grace, so to blesse and prosper our late earefull endeuours, as well for the repairing of all former breaches, as for supplying of the present defects, wherewith the Colony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a sodaine growne to double that height, strength, plenty, and prosperity, which it had in former times attained: We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our place, accordingly as it hath beene also ordered by a generall Court, to Summon as it were by a kinde of louing inuitement, the whole Body of the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great expences and trauailes.  1 See vol.

    "1590": "308 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  And first to remoue that vnworthy aspersion, where[2]with ill disposed mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from thence, and by rumours here at home, sought vniustly to staine and blem- ish that Countrey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it necessary for the full satisfaction of all, to make it publikely known, that by diligent examination we haue assuredly found, those Letters and Rumours to haue been false and malicious; procured by practise, and suborned to euill purposes: and contrarily disaduowed by the testimony vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Colony; by whom we are ascertained, that the Countrey is rich, spacious and well watered; tem- perate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accustomed to it; abounding with all Gods naturall blessings: The Land replenished with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Deere, and other Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Riuers (whereof many are exceeding faire and nauigable,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts desireable; both Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great store and variety: In Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reserued by the prouidence of God, for such as shall apply themselues faithfully to his seruice, and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation. But touching those Commodities for which that Countrey is proper, and which haue beene lately set vp for the Aduenturors benefit: we referre you to a true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and generall Court, and here- unto annexed for your better information. By which and other approued informations brought vnto vs, We rest in great assurance, that this Countrey, as it is seated neere the midst of the world, betweene the extreamities of heate and cold; So it also par[3]ticipateth of the benefits of bothe, and is capable (being assisted with skill and industry) of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and Cordage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with ease and plenty. The Masts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, (being the materials of Linnen,) which now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iren, which hath so wasted our English Woods, that it selfe in short time must decay together with them, is to be had in Virginia, (where wasting of Woods is a benefit) ",
    "1591": "JUNE 22, 1620 309  for all good conditions answerable to the best in the world. The Wines, Fruite, and Salt of France and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will be found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferiour. We omit here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dispersed vp and downe the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent Dyes: of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall scruice: of sweet Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: of Cotten-wooll, and Suger Canes: all which may there also be had in abundance, with an infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle and Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Grae of that Countrey, doth farre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength, and fertility. The Cattle which we haue transported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred) become much bigger of Body, then the [4] breed from which they came: The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde two Fawnes ata birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd, being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of New-found-Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpose can defame.  Now touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country, We haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue bin sent thither this last yeere, and are now presently in going, twelue hundred persons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue specified: and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those that were gone before. The men lately sent, haue bin most of them choise men, borne and bred vp to labour and industry. Out of Deuonshire, about an hundred men, brought vp to Husbandry. Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire, about one hundred and ten; and out of Sussex, about forty; all framed to Tron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme. There haue beene also sundry persons of good quality, much commended for sufficiency, industry and honesty, prouided and sent to take charge and gouernment of those people. The care likewise that hath beene taken by directions, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce the ",
    "1592": "310 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  people and affaires in Virginia into a regular course, hath bin such and so great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and fashion of an orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The people are all diuided [5] into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land due to him set out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publike Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernour there, for the College, and for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and for diuers other necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The particular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are setled in their Seates, being allotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance. The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is reduced within the limits prescribed by his Maiestie: and the laudable forme of Tustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue speedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly hath, partly is bound to haue in short time a sufficient Minister: for whom maintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value. Which orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused the Colony now at length to settle themselues in a firme resolution to perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest-houses, for entertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp their Ploughes; to the planting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple Commodities furnished and commended from henee. In summe, they are now so full of alacritie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall Assembly, they haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the set[6]ling of the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires of the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice. Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authoritie and pleasure, there hath beene a collection made of all the branches of the same, dispersed in his Letiers Patents, now three times renewed: as also out of other Instructions proceeding from his Maiestie. Out of both which, together with such other Orders as (authorized by his Maiestie) ",
    "1593": "JUNE 22, 1620 sil  the Company themselues haue thought necessary to make, hath beene com- piled a booke of standing Orders and Constitutions, approued by the generall consent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the Colony in Virginia, haue their businesse carried regularly, industriously, and lustly, euery man knowing both his right and duty, to their generall great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas the Colony likewise haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of Kngland proper for the vse of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the nature of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important circumstances should necessarily require: a course is likewise taken for the effecting of this worke; yet so as to submit it first to his Majesties view and approbation ; it being not fit that his Maiesties Subiects should be gouerned by any other Lawes, then such as receiue the influence of their life from him.  And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular, by whose charges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maiesties especiall grace) this famous Plan|[7]tation hath not onely beene vndertaken, but through so many difficulties vpheld and continued: we should be very greatly iniurious to them, if we should not acquaint them with this season- able time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto them. We therefore let them know, that in this last yeare now ended, there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen seuerall Patents for particular Plantations; and more are in hand to be passed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vnprobable that vpon each of these Patents, diuers hundreds of persons will soone Plant in Virginia: there haue beene already transported vpon the first, aboue three hundred men. These and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion of Land to them and their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery share of twelue pounds & ten shillings, vpon a first diuision; & as much more vpon a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery person, (to be doubled in like manner) which at their own charges they shall transport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of Tune 1625. if he continue there three yeeres, either at one or scuerall times, or die after he is shipped for that voyage: It standeth them vpon, who are not willing ",
    "1594": "312 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  to be the least in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the last in setting foorth to the choise and peopling of their Land. Wherein what fauour or assistance may by vs be giuen them, they shall be well assured of it, in equall proportion with our selues, as their charges and long expectance haue well deserued. And to the end that not onely the Aduenturors now liuing, but the Heires also of the de[8]eeased, may take certaine notice of the seuerall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Aduentures in mony are due and belonging to them: And likewise that posteritie may truely know, by whose charges this Plantation (next vnder his Maiestie) hath beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: We haue here, ac- cording to an Order of Court, set downe in an Alphabeticall Table the names of all the Aduenturors, with all their seuerall summes aduentured. Wherein if by errour, or other mis-accident, there haue wrong be done to any man; if within one twelue moneth after the date hereof, he giue notice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors, he shall be set right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere vnto vs, then to doe right vnto them, with all Iustifiable curtesie, who haue beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending so much to the propagating of the true seruice of Almighty God, to the adding of greatnesse and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nation in disburdening their multitude. 22.

Vor Wines, it is alfo ordered, that men skilfull be procured in the planting and drefling of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence alfo and other parts to procure Plants of the beft kindes. For Oyle, befides great quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia in great abundance, Olcue-Planis are to be prouided from Marfeilles and Ligorno. Yor Fie, which on thofe Coafts are taken in great plenty, and in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a courfe taken, to preferue the Companies Liberties, and to fet vp the VFifhings in better fort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it in abundance, and after the manner of thofe hotter Climates, which may prooue a great helpe to increafe the Plantation. For Iron, there is sufficient done alreadie.  And for Sawtng-Milles, befides thofe already gone this Spring, there are lately come from Hamborough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be fent in the next fhip. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates {hall be prouided, to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to trafiique and trade for the Company and their Tenants vnder his charge.  [20] Thefe large fupplies of men, Cattle, and Commodities, as they tend to the accomplifhing of this great worke of the Plantation: fo can they not be themfelues effected, without large prouifion of money, being the finewes and mouing Inftruments in thefe great Actions.  To which end wee defire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be aflifting to vs, by fuch meanes as they fhall pleafe: efpecially that the remaine of all promifed Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in without faile, which we truft will now be done cheerefully on all parts, the inuitements of this yeere being well confidered: that as the prefenting of their firft payments, hath been the beginning, fo the performance of the later, may be the perfecting and finifhing of this worke, fo glorious before God and man.  And here by the way, for the clearing of fome feruples and errors through miftaking of our writings lately publifhed, we are to aduertife, that the Alphabet of Aduenturers and fummes aduentured, neither then conucniently ",
    "1598": "316 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  could, nor was intended to extend any further, then to fuch fummes as haue been paid in to the Treafurors of the Company, and to Sir Bapti/t Hicks, by {peciall order of Court. And whereas diuers other bils of Aduen- ture, haue bin heretofore deliuered, partly vpon perfonall aduenture, and no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deferts, partly for fummes paid to other men, whofe Accounts hang yet vncleared (and not to the Treafurors) and partly for goods which neuer came [21] within the Treafurers Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whofe hands they were deliuered, for which notwithftanding bils of Aduenture haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treafuror: Ii the Aduenturors fhall be pleafed within the time prefixed, to put in their iuft claimes, by thefe or any other wayes whatfoeuer, there fhall be right done to them, and a new Alphabeticall booke fhall be publifhed, embracing exactly all kinde of Aduenturors, with their feueral fummes either really aduentured, or otherwife accepted, allowed or beftowed, be it vpon what caufe, or in what kinde foeuer.  Now if the Aduenturors be thus requefted, with much greater reafon are all Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and make perfect their feuerall Accounts, and to pay in thofe monyes, which fhall remaine due to the Company: that fo all parts concurring with their duties and endeuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy.  Laftly, as heretofore, fo we now alfo declare, that the perfons to be admitted to goe, as the Companies-Tenants, and with the forefaid conditions, fhall be no other then good men, that is to fay, of good Trades, of skill in husbandry, or induftrious labourers; and fuch of thofe as fhall be commended for their honeft conuerfation: which perfons repairing to the Citie of London, to Mr. Ferrar, Deputy to the Company, his houfe in St. Sithes lane, in the beginning of Augu/?, and in the middle of fanuary, next, according to the feuerall numbers at thofe times to be fent, fhall from thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies char- [22] ges, til fueh time as they be fhipped for Virginia: there being efpeciall care likewife taken, for the prouiding of good Commanders and Directors of their workes.  Giuen in a Generall Court held for Virginia the eighteenth of Iuly, 1620.  The feuerall Trades-men to be entertained. ",
