J haue thought it therefore a part of some acceptable seruice in me towards you, whose fauors haue preferred me to be a member of your Company, to present you with these my poore labours, the Collection of the truth hereof, drawne from the relation of some of those that were beholders of that Tragedie, and who hardly eseaped from tasting of the same cup, as also from the Letters sent you by the Gowernour and other Gentlemen of quality, and of the Councell in that Colonie, read openly here in your Courts: That so the world may see that it was not the strength of a professed enemy that brought this slaughter on them, but contriued by the perfidious treachery of a false- hearted people, that know not God nor faith, No generous Spirit will forbeare to goe on for this accident that hath hapned to the Plantation, but proceed rather chearfully in this honorable Enterprize, since the discouery of their bruitish falshood will proue (as shall appeare by this Treatise following) many waies aduantageable to vs, and make this forewarning a forearming for euer to preuent a greater mischiefe.

    "1828": "1622 543  Although there haue been many and sundry Treatises writ of Virginia, and the Commodities thereof; whereat malitious men may take occasion to cauill, but godly men will finde good cause to praise the Almighty, whose wonders are seene in the deepe, through the which we haue sailed to the discouery of this good Land: Yet I haue not thought it aniisse (since T am to expresse some late Accidents) before-hand to summe vp the benefits of that Countrey; partly because they daily encrease by new Dis- coueries made, to the glory of our most gratious King, and euer renowned to all posteritie, for the founding and supporting of this most Royall and blessed work of Plantation, to the great honor, wealth [2] and happinesse of his most famous Kingdomes; and partly, because such is the customary daintinesse of Readers, that they seldome take the paines to gather together all that hath beene written of any subiect, that so they might take the whole businesse into their consideration, (which is the onely way to make a true iudgement,) but vsually content themselues with one or two Bookes set out occasionally, and with reference to some former Treatises, whereby they gaine but a lame and parcell-knowledge, and so oftentimes both preiudice themselues and the truth.  The Countrey called Vircinta (so named by the late Virgin-Quceene Hliza- beth of blessed memory) being the rightfull inheritance of his Maiesty, as being first discouered at the costs and charges of that most prudent Prince of famous memory, King Henry the Seauenth, his Maiesties great Grand- father; The Patent whereof still extant to be seene, was granted to John Cabot and diuers other of his subiects, who went thither with sixe Saile of Ships, and discouered as farre as from Cape Florida to New-found-land, all along the Coast, and tooke possession thereof to the Kings vse, about that time when Ferdinando and Isabella discouered the Westerne Indies: (by which title of first discouery the King of Portugal and Spaine hold and enioy their ample and rich Kingdomes in their Jndies Kast & West:) A coast where King Edward the Sixt after planted his fishing to the New- found-land by publike Act in Parliament, and of which Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlow tooke againe possession to the vse of the late Queene Elizabeth: and after them, [8] Sir Richard Greenfield, Sir Ralph Lane, and Sir Walter Rawleigh; at what time seuerall Colonics were there placed. And since his Maiesties most happy comming to the Crowne, being an ",
    "1829": "544 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  absolute King of three of the most populous Kingdomes (which Charles the Fift was wont to tearme Officina gentium, the shop or forge of men,) finding his Subiects to multiply by the blessed peace they enioy vnder his happy gouernment, did out of his high wisedome and Princely care of the good of his Subiects, grant a most gratious Patent to diuers Honour- able persons, and others of his louing Subiects, authorizing them thereby to goe on in the Plantation of this his lawfull and rightfull Kingdome of Vircinia, which by the blessing of Almighty God is growne to good perfection.  This spatious and fruitful Country of Viren, is (as is generally knowne to all) naturally rich, and exceedingly well watered, very temperate, and healthfull to the Inhabitants, abounding with as many naturall blessings, and replenished with as goodly Woods, and those full of Deere and sundry other beasts for mans sustenance; and the Seas and Riuers thereof (many therein being exceeding fayre and nauigable) as full of excellent fish of diuers sorts, and both water & land yeelding as great variety of fowle, as any Country in the world is knowne to afford. The situation whereof being neere the middest of the world, betweene the extremities of heate and colde, seemes to partake of the benefits of both, and therby becometh capable of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. From whence ariseth an assurance [4] that (by the assistance and skill of industry) those rich Furres, Cordage, and other Commodities, which with difficulty and danger are now drawn from Russia, will be had in Vireinta and the parts adioyning, with ease and safety. And the Masts, Plancks, and Boards, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, which now are fetched from Nerway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, will there be had in abundance. The Iron, which hath so wasted our English Woods, (that it selfe in short time must decay together with them) is to be had in Virarnta (where wasting of Woods is an ease and benefit to the Planter) for all good conditions answerable to the best Iron of the world, whereof proofe hath beene made. The Wines, Fruits, and Salt of France and Spaine: the Silkes of Persia and Italy, will be had also in Virarnr4, in no kinde of worth inferiour, where are whole Woods of many miles together of Mulberry trees of the best kindes, the proper food of the Silke-worme, and a multitude of other naturall commodities. Of Woods, Roots and Berries, for excellent Dyes; of Plants and other Drugs ",
    "1830": "1622 545  for Physicall seruice; of sweet Woods, Oyles and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse; of Cotton-wooll, Silke-grasse and Sugar-Canes, will there be had in abundance, with many other kindes. And for Corne, Cattell, and Fish, (which are the substance of the food of man) in no place better: the Graine also of our owne Country prospering there very well; but their Maize (being the naturall Graine of Virarnia) doth farre exceed in pleasant- nesse, strength, fertilitie, and generalitie of vse, the Wheat of England.  {5} The Cattell which were transported thither (being now growne neere to fifteene hundred) doc become much bigger of body then the breed from whence they came. The Horses also (through the benefit of the Climate, and nature of their feeding) more beautifull and fuller of courage. And such is the extraordinary fertilitie of that soyle, that the Does of their Deere (a kinde differing from ours in England, yet no way inferiour) yeeld two Fawnes at a fall or birth, and sometimes three. And the Fishings along our Coasts are in plenty of Fish equall to those of New-found-land, and in greatnesse and goodnesse much superiour, and twice in the yeare to be taken, in their going and returne, which is not else-where found in such plenty and varietie; So as there went this yeare from diuers parts of this Kingdome, neere thirty Saile thither, who are well returned and richly fished.  To conclude (but out of certaine aduertisements so often reiterated from thence, as well as by the constant relations of many hundreds now yearely comming & going) they auow, that it is a Country which nothing but igno- rance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde & ill purpose can defame, which as it paralelleth the most opulent and rich Kingdomes of the world, by lying in the same Latitude with them, so doth it promise richer Mynes of the best and most desired mettals with them, when the Colonie shall be of sufficient strength to open and defend them. And for the Passage thither, and Trade there, it is free from all restraint by forren Princes, whereunto most of our other accustomed trades are subiect: there is neyther danger in the way, through [6] the encountring of the Enemy or Pyrate, nor meeting with Rockes or Sholes (by reason of the fayre and safe passage thorow the maine Ocean) nor tediousnes of tourney, which by reason of better knowledge then in former yeares (the fruit of time and obseruation) is oftner made and in fewer weekes, then formerly it was wont ",

And how that in December last they had planted and cultiuated in VIRGINIA Vines of all sorts, (as well those naturally growing, as those other Plants sent them from these parts of Europe) Orenge and Lemon-trees, Figge-trees, Sugar-Canes, Cotion- wooll, Cassaui Rootes, (that make very good bread) Plantanes, Potatoes, and sundry other /ndian fruits and plants not formerly seenein VIRGINIA, which at the time of their said Letters beganne to prosper very well: as also their Indico-seedes, for the true cure whereof there is lately caused a Treatise to be written.  Furthermore, they write that in a Voyage made by Lieutenant Marmaduke Parkinson, and other English Gentlemen, vp the Riuer of Patomack they saw a China Boxe at one of the Kings houses where they were: Being demanded where he had it, made answer, That it was sent him from a King that dwelt in the West, ouer the great Hils, some tenne dayes iourney, whose Countrey is neare a great Sea, hee hauing that Boxe, from a people as he said, that came thither in ships, that weare cloaths, crooked swords, & somwhat like our men, dwelt in houses, and were called Acanack-China: and he offered our people, that he would send [9] his Brother along with them to that King, which offer the Gouernor purposed not to refuse; and the rather, by reason of the continual constant relations of all those Sauages in VIRGINIA, of a Sea, and the way to it West, they affirming that the heads of all those seauen goodly Rivers, (the least wherof is greater then the Riuer of Thames, and nauigable aboue an hundred and fifty miles, and not aboue sixe or eight miles one from another) which fall all into one ",

But for the further proofe hereof, and of the North-west passage thither by Sea, I referre the Reader to the Treatie annexed at the end of this Booke, written by that learned and famous Mathematician, M' Henry Briggs, which I hauing happily attained vnto, haue published for the common good.  Moreouer, the Letters of Mr. John Berkley, sometimes of Beuerstone Castle in the County of Glocester, (a Gentleman of an honorable Familie) likewise certifie, that a more fit place for Iron-workes (whereof he was made Master & ouer-seer) then in VIRGINIA, both for wood, water, mynes, and stone, was not to be found: And that by Whatsontede then next (now past) the Company might relye vpon good quantities [10] of Iron made by him: which also by Letters from Mr. George Sandis the third of March last, was confirmed, with this farther description of the place (called The falling Creeke) to be so fitting for that purpose, as if Nature had applyed her selfe to the wish and direction of the Workeman; where also were great stones hardly seene else where in VIRGINIA, lying on the place, as though they had beene brought thither to aduance the erection of those Workes.  The Letters of the French Vignerous or Vine-men, procured out of France & sent ouer into VIRGINIA, did likewise assertaine, that no Countrey in the world was more proper for Vines, Silke, Rice, Oliues, and other Fruits, then VIRGINIA is: and that it farre excelled their owne Countrey of Languedocke; the Vines of diuers sorts being in abundance naturally ouer all the Countrey: and they hauing planted some cuttings of Vines at Michaelmas last, in their Letters affrme that these bare Grapes already this Spring, to their great wonder, as being a thing they suppose not heard of in any other Countrey. <A taste of Wine made of the wilde grape, they last year sent, with hope to send a good quantitie this next Vintage; and that the Mulberry-trees where they abode were in wonderfull abundance, ",
    "1834": "1622 549  and much excelling both in goodnesse and greatnesse those of their owne Country of Languedocke: and that those Silke-wormes they haue, prosper exceeding well, and some Silke they hope to send this yeare, there wanting nothing to set vp that rich Commodity but store of hands wherewith England doth abound. Of the fruit of which Mulberry-trees (as of a Plum there plentifully grow[11]ing) they would make wholsome drinkes for the Colony and people there.  The Letters of M' Porey (verified also from the Gouernor and Councell) aduertised of a late Discouery by him and others made into the great Bay Northward, (reseruing the sounding of the bottome thereof for a second Voyage,) where hee left setled very happily neare an hundred English, with hope of a good trade for Furres there to be had. From thence was brought by Lieutenant Perkinson, in his voyage, some of that kind of Earth which is called Yerra Lemnia (there to be had in great abundance) as good as that of Turkey.  By this (though it be but in part) the Reader may vnderstand the great riches and blessings of this excellent Countrey, which euen ordinary diligence and care must needes strangely improue. But that all men may see the vnpartiall ingenuity of this Discourse, we freely confesse, that the Countrey is not so good, as the Natiues are bad, whose barbarous Saua- genesse needs more cultivation then the ground it selfe, being more ouer- spread with inciuilitie and treachery, then that with Bryers. For the land being tilled and vsed well by vs, deceiued not our expectation, but rather exceeded it farre, being so thankfull as to returne an hundred for one. But the Sauages though neuer Nation vsed so kindly vpon so small desert, haue in stead of that Haruest which our paines merited, returned nothing but Bryers and thornes, pricking euen to death many of their Benefactors: yet doubt wee not, but that as all wickednes is crafty to vndoe it self, so these also, thorow our sides, haue more wounded [12] themselues then vs, God Almighty making way for seueritie there, where a fayre gentlenesse would not take place. The occasion whereof thus I relate from thence.  The last May there came Letters from Sir Francis Wiat Gouernor in VIRGINIA, which did aduertise that when in Nouember last he ariued in VIRGINIA, and entred vpon his Gouernment, he found the Country setled in a peace (as all men there thought) sure and vnuiolable, not onely ",
    "1835": "550 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  because it was solemnly ratified and sworne, and at the request of the Natiue King stamped in Brasse, and fixed to one of his Oakes of note, but as being aduantagious to both parts; to the Sauages as the weaker, vnder which they were safely sheltred and defended; to vs, as being the easiest way then thought to pursue and aduance our proiects of buildings, plant- ings, and effecting their conuersion by peaceable and fayre meanes. And such was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome or neuer a sword worne, and a Peece seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle. By which assurance of securitie, the Plantations of particular Aduenturers and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne of rich ground inuited them, and the further from neighbors held the better. The houses generally set open to the Sauages, who were alwaies friendly entertained at the tables of the English, and commonly lodged in their bed-chambers. The old planters (as they thought now come to reape the benefit of their long trauels) placed with wonderfull content vpon their priuate diuidents, and the planting [13] of particular Hundreds and Colonies pursued with an hopefull alacrity, all our projects (saith he) in a faire way, and their familarity with the Natiues, seeming to open a faire gate for their conuersion to Christianitie.  The Country being in this estate, an occasion was ministred of sending to Opachankano the King of these Sauages, about the middle of March last, what time the Messenger returned backe with these words from him, That he held the peace concluded so firme, as the Skie should sooner fall then it dissolue: yea, such was the treacherous dissimulation of that people who then had contriued our destruction, that euen two dayes before the Mas- saere, some of our men were guided thorow the woods by them in safety: and one Browne, who then to learne the language liued among the Warra- scoyacks (a Prouince of that King) was in friendly manner sent backe by them to Captaine Hamor his Master, and many the like passages, rather increasing our former confidence, then any wise in the world ministring the least suspition of the breach of the peace, or of what instantly ensued; yea, they borrowed our owne Boates to conuey themselues crosse the Riuer (on the bankes of both sides whereof all our Plantations were) to consult of the diuellish murder that ensued, and of our vtter extirpation, which God of his mercy (by the meanes of some of themselues conuerted to Christianitie) preuented; and as well on the Friday morning (the fatal ",
    "1836": "1622 551  day) the 22 of March, as also in the euening, as in other dayes before, they came vnarmed into our houses, without Bowes or arrowes, or other weap- ons, with Deere, Turkies, Fish, [14] Furres, and other prouisions, to sell, and trucke with vs, for glasse, beades, and other trifles: yea in some places, sate downe at Breakfast with our people at their tables, whom immediately with their owne tooles and weapons, eyther laid downe, or standing in their houses, they basely and barbarously murthered, not sparing eyther age or sexe, man, woman or childe; so sodaine in their eruell execution, that few or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction. In which manner they also slew many of our people then at their seuerall workes and husbandries in the fields, and without their houses, some in planting Corne and Tobacco, some in gardening, some in making Bricke, building, sawing, and other kindes of husbandry, they well knowing in what places and quarters each of our men were, in regard of their daily familiarity, and resort to vs for trading and other negotiations, which the more willingly was by vs continued and cherished for the desire we had of effecting that great master-peece of workes, their conuersion. And by this meanes that fatall Friday morning, there fell vnder the bloudy and barbarous hands of that perfidious and inhumane people, contrary to all lawes of God and men, of Nature & Nations, three hundred forty seuen men, women, and children, most by their owne weapons; and not being content with taking away life alone, they fell after againe vpon the dead, making as well as they could, a fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and mangling the dead carkasses into many pieces, and carrying some parts away in derision, with base and bruitish triumph.  Neither yet did these beasts spare those amongst [15] the rest well knowne votthem, from whom they had daily recetued many benefits and fauours, but spitefully also massacred them, without remorse or pitty, being in this more fell then Lyons and Dragons, which (as Histories record) haue beene so farre from hurting, as they haue both acknowledged, and gratefully requited their Benefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell beasts, as to make them put off the very nature of beasts, and to put on humanity vpon them. But these miscreants, contrariwise in this kinde, put not off onely all humanity, but put on a worse and more then vnnaturall bruitishnesse. One instance of it, amongst too many, shall serue for all. ",
    "1837": "552 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  That worthy religious Gentleman, Master George Thorpe Esquire, Deputie of the Colledge lands, sometimes one of his Maiesties Pentioners, and in one of the principall places of command in VIRGINIA, did so truly and earnestly affect their conuersion, and was so tender ouer them, that whosoeuer vnder his authority had giuen them but the least displeasure or discontent, he punished them seuerely. He thought nothing too deare for them, and as being desirous to binde them vnto him by his many courtesies, hee neuer denyed them any thing that they asked him, insomuch that when these Savages complained vnto him of the fiercenesse of our Mastiues, most implacable and terrible vnto them, (knowing them by instinct it seemes, to be but treacherous and false-hearted friends to vs, better then our selues) he to gratifie them in all things, for the winning of them by degrees, caused some of them to be killed in their presence, to the great dis[16]pleasure of the owners, and would haue had all the rest guelt (had he not beene hindered) to make them the gentler and the milder to them. Hee was not onely too kinde and beneficiall to the common sort, but also to their King, to whom hee oft resorted, and gaue many presents which hee knew to be highly pleasing to him, And whereas this king before dwelt onely in a cottage, or rather a denne or hog-stye, made with a few poles and stickes, and couered with mats after their wyld manner, to ciuilize him, he first, built him a fayre house according to the English fashion, in which hee tooke such ioy, especially in his locke and key, which hee so admired, as locking and vnlocking his doore an hundred times aday, hee thought no deuice in all the world was comparable to it.  Thus insinuating himselfe to this King for his religious purposes, he con- ferred after with him oft, and intimated to him matters of our Religion; and thus far the Pagan confessed, moued by naturall Principles, that our God was a good God, and better much then theirs, in that he had with so many good things aboue them endowed vs. Hee told him, if hee would serue our God, hee should bee partaker of all those good things wee had, and of farre greater then sense or reason euer could imagine. Hee wonne vpon him, as hee thought in many things, so as hee gaue him fayre hearing and good answer, and seemed to be much pleased with his discourse and in his company. And both hee and his people for the daily courtesies this good Gentleman did to one or other of them, did professe such outward loue and respect vnto him, as nothing could seeme more: but all was little ",
    "1838": "1622 553  regarded after by [17] this Viperous brood, as the sequell shewed: for they not, only wilfully murdered him, but cruelly and felly, out of deuillish malice, did so many barbarous despights and foule scornes after to his dead corpes, as are vnbefitting to be heard by any ciuill eare. One thing I cannot omit, that when this good Gentleman vpon his fatall hower, was warned by his man (who perceiued some treachery intended to them by these hell- hounds) to looke to himselfe, and withall ranne away for feare of the mischiefe he strongly apprehended, and so saued his owne life; yet his Master, out of the conscience of his owne good meaning, and faire deserts euer towards them, was so void of all suspition, and so full of confidence, that they had sooner killed him, then hee could or would beleeue they meant any ill against him. Thus the sinnes of these wicked Infidels, haue made them vnworthy of enioying him, and the eternall good that he most zealously alwayes intended to them.  And thus these miserable wretches, not hee, hath lost by it, who to the comfort of vs all, hath gayned a Crowne of endlesse blisse, and is assuredly become a glorious Martyr, in which thrice-happy and blessed state we leaue him. But these miscreants, who haue thus despised Gods great mercies so freely offered to them, must needs in time therefore be cor- rected by his iustice: So as those who by the way of mercies would not be drawne vnto him, shall some of them at length (no doubt) be brought vnto him by his way of iudgements: to which leauing them, I will knit againe together now the thred of my Discourse, and proceed to tell you, That at the time of this Massacre [18] there were three or foure of our ships in Tames-Riuer, and one in the next Riuer, and daily more to come in, as three did within fourteene dayes after; one of which they endeuored to haue surprised, but in vaine, as had also beene their whole attempt, had any the least fore-knowledge beene in those places where the Massacre was committed: yet were the hearts of the English euer stupid, and auerted from beleeuing any thing that might weaken their hopes of speedy winning the Sauages to Ciuilitie and Religion, by kinde vsage and fayre conuersing amongst them. Hee, and the whole Councell write further, That Almighty God (they doubt not) hath his great worke to doe in this Tragedy, and will thereout draw honor and glory to his great Name; safety, and a more flourishing estate to themselues, and the whole Planta- tion there; and the more speedy conuersion of the Children of those Sauages ",
    "1839": "554 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  to himselfe, since hee so miraculously preserued so many of the English (there being, God be praysed, about eleuen parts of twelue still remayning) whose desire to draw those people to Religion by the carelesse neglect of their owne safeties, seemes to haue beene the greatest cause of their own ensuing destruction. Yet it pleased God to vse some of them as instru- ments to saue many of their liues, whose soules they had formerly saued, as at Iames-Citie, and other places, and the Pinnace trading in Pamounkey Riuer, all whose liues were saued by a conuerted Indian, disclosing the plot in the instant (whereof though our sinnes (say they) made vs vnworthy to be instruments of so glorious a conuersion in generall, yet his infinite wisedome can neuerthelesse bring it to passe [19] with some more of them, and with other Prouinces there in his good time, and by such meanes as wee thinke most vnlikely. For euen in the deliuery of vs that now suruiue, no mans particular carefulnesse saued any one person, but the meere goodnesse of himselfe, freely and miraculously preserued whom it pleased him.  The Letters of Mr. George Sandis a worthy Gentleman and Treasurer there, likewise haue aduertised (as many others from many particular persons of note and worth) besides the Relations of many returned in the Sea-flower (the ship that brought vs this vnweleome newes) haue beene heard at large in the publike Courts, that whilst all their affayres were full of suecesse, and such intercourse of familiaritie, as if the Indians and themselues had beene of one Nation, those treacherous Natiues, after fiue yeares peace, by a generall combination in one day plotted to subuert their whole Colony, and at one instant of time, though our seuerall Plan- tations were an hundred and forty miles vp one Riuer on both sides.  But before I goe any further, for the better vnderstanding of all things, you shall know that these wyld naked Natiues liue not in great numbers together, but dispersed, and in small companies; and where most together, not aboue two hundred, and that very rare, in other places fifty or forty, or thereabouts, and many miles distant from one another, in such places among the Woods where they either found, or might easiliest make some cleared plots of ground, which they imploy wholly in setting of Corne, whereby to sustaine their liues. These small and scattered Companies (as [20] I haue said) had warning giuen from one another in all their habita- tions to meete at the day and houre appointed for our destruction, at all ",
    "1840": "1622 555  our seuerall Townes and places seated vpon the Riuer; some were directed to goe to one place, some to another, all to be done at the same day and time, which they did accordingly: some entring their Houses vnder colour of trucking, and so taking aduantage, others drawing our men abroad vpon faire pretences, and the rest suddenly falling vpon those that were at their labours.  They certifie further, that besides Master George Thorpe, before mentioned, Master John Berkeley, Captaine Nathanael Powel, and his wife, (daughter of Master Wiliam Tracy, and great with childe) and Captaine Maycock, all Gentlemen of birth, vertue, and industry, and of the Councell there, suffered ynder this their cruelty and treason.  That the slaughter had beene vniuersall, if God had not put it into the heart of an Indian belonging to one Perry, to disclose it, who liuing in the house of one Pace, was vrged by another Indian his Brother (who came the night before and lay with him) to kill Pace, (so commanded by their King as he declared) as hee would kill Perry: telling further that by such an houre in the morning a number would come from diuers places to finish the Execution, who failed not at the time: Perries Indian rose out of his bed and reueales it to Paee, that vsed him as a Sonne: And thus the rest of the Colony that had warning giuen them, by this meanes was saued. Such was (God bee thanked for it) the good fruit of an Infidell conuerted to Christianity; for though three hundred and more of ours [21] died by many of these Pagan Infidels, yet thousands of ours were saued by the means of one of them alone which was made a Christian; Blessed be God for euer, whose merey endureth for euer; Blessed bee God whose mercy is aboue his iustice, and farre aboue all his workes: who wrought this deliuerance whereby their soules escaped euen as a Bird out of the snare of the Fowler.  Pace ypon this discouery, securing his house, before day rowed ouer the Riuer to James-City (in that place neere three miles in bredth) and gaue notice thereof to the Gouernor, by which meanes they were prevented there, and at such other Plantations as was possible for a timely intelligence to be giuen; for where they saw vs standing vpon our Guard, at the sight of a Peece they all ranne away. In other places that could haue no notice, some Peeces with munition (the vse whereof they know not) were there ",
    "1841": "556 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  carried away, and some few Cattell also were destroyed by them. And as Fame diuulgeth (not without probable grounds) their King hath since caused the most part of the Gunpowder by him surprized, to bee sowne, to draw therefrom the like increase, as of his Maize or Corne, in Haruest next. And that it is since discouered, that the last Summer Opachankano practised with a King of the Eastern shore (no well-willer of his) to furnish him with store of poison (naturally growing in his country) for our destruc- tion, whieh he absolutely refused, though he sent him great store of Beades, and other presents to winne him thereunto: which he, with fiue or sixe of his great men, offered to be ready to iustifie against him. That the true cause [22] of this surprize was most by the instigation of the Deuill, (enemy to their saluation) and the dayly feare that possest them, that in time we by our growing continually vpon them, would dispossesse them of this Country, as they had beene formerly of the West Indies by the Spaniard; produced this bloody act. That neuer griefe and shame possessed any people more then themselues, to be thus butchered by so naked and cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presentment of a staffe in manner of a Peece, nor an vncharged Peece in the hands of a woman, from which they flye as so many Hares; much faster then from their tormenting Deuill, whom they worship for feare, though they acknowledge they loue him not.  Thus haue you seene the particulars of this massacre, out of Letters from thence written, wherein treachery and cruelty haue done their worst to vs, or rather to themselues; for whose vnderstanding is so shallow, as not to pereeiue that this must needs bee for the good of the Plantation after, and the losse of this blood to make the body more healthfull, as by these reasons may be manifest.  First, Because betraying of innocency neuer rests vnpunished: And there- fore Agesilaus, when his enemies (vpon whose oath of being faithfull hee rested) had deceiued him, he sent them thankes, for that by their periury, they had made God his friend, and their enemy.  Secondly, Because our hands which before were tied with gentlenesse and faire vsage, are now set at liberty by the treacherous violence of the Sausages, [23] not vntying the Knot, but cutting it: So that we, who hitherto haue ",
    "1842": "1622 557  had possession of no more ground then their waste, and our purchase at a valuable consideration to their owne contentment, gained; may now by right of Warre, and law of Nations, inuade the Country, and destroy them who sought to destroy vs: whereby wee shall enioy their cultiuated places, turning the laborious Mattocke into the victorious Sword (whercin there is more both ease, benefit, and glory) and possessing the fruits of others labours. Now their cleared grounds in all their villages (which are situate in the fruitfullest places of the land) shall be inhabited by vs, whereas heretofore the grubbing of woods was the greatest labour.  Thirdly, Because those commodities which the Indians enioyed as much or rather more than we, shall now also be entirely possessed by vs. The Deere and other beasts will be in safety, and infinitly inerease, which heretofore not onely in the general) huntings of the King (whereat foure or fiue hundred Deere were vsually slaine) but by each particular Indian were destroied at all times of the yeare, without any difference of Male, Damme, or Young. The like may be said of our owne Swine and Goats, whereof they haue vsed to kill eight in tenne more than the English haue done. There will be also a great increase of wild Turkies, and other waighty Fowle, for the Indians neuer put difference of destroying the Hen, but kill them whether in season or not, whether in breeding time, or sitting on their egges, or hauing new hatched, it is all one to them: whereby, as also by the orderly vsing of their fishing Weares, no knowne Country in [24] the world will so plentifully abound in victuall.  Fourthly, Because the way of conquering them is much more easie then of ciuilizing them by faire meanes, for they are a rude, barbarous, and naked people, scattered in small companies, which are helps to Victorie, but hinderances to Ciuilitie: Besides that, a conquest may be of many, and at once; but ciuility is in particular, and slow, the effect of long time, and great industry. Moreouer, victorie of them may bee gained many waies; by force, by surprize, by famine in burning their Corne, by destroy- ing and burning their Boats, Canoes, and Houses, by breaking their fishing Weares, by assailing them in their huntings, whereby they get the greatest part of their sustenance in Winter, by pursuing and chasing them with our horses, and blood-Hounds to draw after them, and Mastiues to teare them, which take this naked, tanned, deformed Sauages, for no other 12892387 ",

By these and sundry other wayes, as by driuing them (when they flye) vpon their enemies, who are round about them, and by animating and abetting their enemies against them, may their ruine or subiection be soone effected.  So the Spaniard made great vse for his owne turne of the quarrels and enmities that were amongst the Indians, as throughly vnderstanding and following that Maxime of the Politician, Diude & impera, Make diuisions and take Kingdomes: For thus he got two of the greatest Kingdomes of the West Indies, Peru and [25] Mexico, by the Princes diuisions, and the peo- ples differences. After the death of Guainacapa king of Peru, his sonnes Attabalippa and Gascar falling to war about the kingdom, & each of th\u00e9 striuing to make the Spaniard to his friend, Francis Pizzarro managing those their diuisions onely to his owne ends, easily stripped them both of that rich Kingdome, and became Master of Peru. And so likwise Ferdz- nando Cortez vanquished King Motezuma, and gained the Kingdome of Mexico from him, by the aid and furtherance of the neighboring people of the Prouince of T'ascala, being deadly enemies to the Mexicans; for which seruice they of Tascala are freed by the Spaniards from all Tributes to this time. In VIRGINIA the many diuers Princes and people there are at this day opposite in infinite factions one vnto another, and many of them beare a mortal! hatred to these our barbarous Sauages, that haue beene likely as false and perfidious heretofore to them, as vnto vs of late. So as the quarrels, and the causes of them, and the different humours of these people being well vnderstood, it will be an easie matter to ouerthrow those that now are, or may bee our enemies hereafter, by ayding and setting on their enemies against them. And by these factions and differ- ences of petty Princes, the Romans tooke their greatest aduantage to ouercome this Iland of Great Britayne, of which Tacitus sayes, Ita dum singuli pugnant vniuerst vincuntur. And Justin hath the like saying of the cause of vanquishing the Grecian Cities.  Fiftly, Because the Jndians, who before were vsed as friends, may now most iustly be compelled to seruitude and drudgery, and supply the roome of men [26] that labour, whereby euen the meanest of the Plantation may imploy themselues more entirely in their Arts and Oecupations, which ",
    "1844": "1622 559  are more generous, whilest Sauages performe their inferiour workes of digging in mynes, and the like, of whom also some may be sent for the seruice of the Sommer Ilands.  Sixtly, This will for ever hereafter make vs more cautelous and circum- spect, as neuer to bee deceiued more by any other treacheries, but will serue for a great instruction to all posteritie there, to teach them that Trust is the mother of Decetpt, and to learne them that of the Italian, Chi non fida, non s'ingamuu, Hee that trusts not is not deceiued: and make them know that kindnesses are misspent vpon rude natures, so long as they continue rude; as also, that Sauages and Pagans are aboue all other for matter of Iustice euer to be suspected. Thus vpon this Anvile shall wee now beate out to our selues an armour of proofe, which shall for euer after defend vs from barbarous Incursions, and from greater dangers that otherwise might happen. And so we may truly say according to the French Prouerb, Aquelg; chose malheur est bon, Ill lucke is good for something.  Lastly, We haue this benefit more to our comfort, because all good men doe now take much more care of vs then before, since the fault is on their sides, not on ours, who haue vsed so fayre a cariage, euen to our owne destruction. Especially his Mazesttes most gratious, tender and paternall care is manifest herein, who by his Royall bounty and goodnesse, hath continued his many fauors vnto vs, with a new, large, & Princely supply of Munition and Armes, out of his Maiesties [27] owne store in the Tower, being gratiously bestowed for the safety and aduancement of the Planta- tion. As also his Royall fauor is amply extended in a large supply of men and other necessaries throughout the whole Kingdome, which are very shortly to bee sent to VIRGINIA.  Neyther must wee omit the Honourable City of London, who to shew their zeale at this time (as they haue alwayes done vpon all Honourable occasions to their endlesse praise) are now setting forth one hundred persons, at their owne charges, for the aduancement of the Plantations. In the furtherance of which action, as the whole graue Senate of Aldermen haue shewed much piety and wisedome, so in particular, the Right Honourable Sir Edward Barkham Knight, the now Lord Mayor, hath demonstrated a most worthy ",
    "1845": "560 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  mind. Besides many worthy Persons of birth and quality, and divers others at their owne costs are now preparing for VIRGINIA. Neyther is any man to be deiected because of some such disasters as these that may seeme to thwart the businesse.  What growing State was there euer in the world which had not the like? Rome grew by opposition, and rose vpon the backe of her enemies. Marke but the Spaniard who is in the same Continent with VIRGINIA, and hath now perfected his worke; Marke and tell mee, if hee hath not had more counterbuffes farre then wee, as out of their owne histories at large may be proued.  Columbus vpon his returne from the West Indies into Spaine, hauing left his people with the Indian in peace, and promise of fayre vsage towards them, yet [28] at his comming backe againe, hee found no one man aliue of them, but all by the Natiues treacherously slaine.  After this againe, when the Spanish Colony was increased in great numbers, the Indians (from whom the Spaniards for trucking stuffe vsed to haue all their corn) generally conspired together to plant no corne at all, intending therby to famish them, themselues liuing in the meane time vpon Cassaut (a root to make bread) onely then knowne to themselues: This plot of theirs by the Spaniards ouer-sight (that foolishly depended vpon Strangers for their bread) tooke such effect, and brought them to such misery by the rage of famine, that they spared no vncleane, no loathsome beast, no not the poysonous and hideous Serpents, but eate them vp also, deuouring one death to saue them from another: And by this meanes the whole Colony well-neare surfetted, sickned, and dyed miserably.  After againe, vpon fresh and great supplyes new made, an infinite company of them by their incontinency dyed of the Indian disease, that hath now got a French name, which at first (as being a strange and vnknowne malady) was deadly vpon whomsoeuer it lighted. Besides (before they knew the cause and remedy) very many lost diuers parts of their body, feet and hands principally, by a little vermine lesse then a Flea, and skipping like it, called Nigua, which got between the skinne and the flesh before they were aware, and there bred and multiplyed, making swellings and putrefactions, to the decay and losse of their bodily members. ",
    "1846": "1622 561  What should I tell you that the Plantations diucrs times were neare vndone, by the ambition, factions, and malice of the Commanders one vnto another. Columbus, to whom they were beholding for all, with his brothers, were sent home from the West Indies into Spaine bound with chaines: and some other great Commanders killed and murthered one another. Pizzarro was killed by Almagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded, which Vasco was taken by Blasco, and this Blasco was likewise taken by Pizzarroes brother. Thus by their owne spightfull and auaritious quarrels did they well-neare shake the mayne pillars of that Plantation.  These and many other calamities and mischiefes, too long to relate now, hapned vnto them more then euer did to vs. And at one time their planta- tion was euen at the last gaspe, all their Colony being resolued desperately to leaue it, had not two ships vnexpected come in with new supplyes: yet wee see for all these miseries, that they haue attained to their ends at last, Honor, power, and wealth; In so much as that Countrey, which (when they were dishartned with disasters) they beganne to be so weary of, that they were about to forsake it all, in short time after (seeing all stormes blowne ouer, and fayre weather shining vpon them) they were so in loue with their great fortunes, that they grew so icalous of them, as made them shut them vp from the sight of any but themselues. And then they peti- tioned their King, by an inuiolable Decree to annexe and vnite the West Indies inseparably for euer to the Crowne of Spaine; which (for their better securitie and satisfaction) was accordingly performed and ratified, as it is to be seene in Hereras His[30]tory of the West Indies. And whereas before, few could be hired to go to inhabite there, now with great suite they must obtaine it.  Thus haue they in time by industry, patience, and constancy effected this great worke of theirs, notwithstanding to encrease their difficulties also, they were to deale with a most populous & numerous nation, which they ouereame at last: So as Oudedo in his third Booke of the first Part of his West Indie History saith, that of a million of Indians at least, that were in Hispaniola, there were not (in little more than forty yeares space after the first beginning of the Plantation) fiue hundred of th\u00e9 & all their children liuing: for the Indians that liued there, after were brought out of the Continent into that Tland, or out of one Tland to be planted in another. ",
    "1847": "562 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  On the other side, the Natiues in VIRGINIA are nothing populous, but thin and scattered Nations, as is knowne to all.  Here by the way to make a little Digression, since I haue mentioned Ouiedo who liued aboue twenty two yeares in the West Indies, I will acquaint you with bis obseruation and iudgement of the nature and disposition of the Indians there, that you may compare and see in what, and how farre, it agrees with that of the Natiues of VIRGINIA.  They are (saith hee) by nature sloathfull and idle, vitious, melancholy, slouenly, of bad conditions, lyers, of small memory, of no constancy or trust. In another place he saith, The Indian is by nature of all people the most lying and most ineonstant in the world, sottish and sodaine: neuer looking what dangers may happen afterwards, lesse capable then children of sixe [31] or seauen yeares old, and lesse apt and ingenious. This is the generall disposition of most of them, though there be some (sayes he) that. be wise and subtill. And indeede it should seeme so, when they could ouerreach and goe beyond the Spaniard so much, to put that tricke of staruing them (as aforesaid) vpon them, to their so great and almost totall destruction.  But to come againe to that which I first intended: Since the Spaniard (as we see) in his Plantations hath gone thorow farre more hazards, and greater difficulties then euer wee haue had, we therefore in looking to what is past, vpon great reason ought likewise not to be deterred, but so much the rather inuited to proceede with constancy and courage. And if besides wee looke (as most men doe) after the riches of a Countrey to inuite vs on, aske those that haue beene there, and haue trauelled farre and neare, and they will tell you, that no Countrey in the world doth naturally abound with more Commodities then VIRGINIA doth. The Clymate is knowne to be more temperate, and the soyle more rich then that of the West Indies is: neyther doth it want mynes of all sorts, no not of the richest, as is knowne to some now liuing, and shall be manifested when fit time shall serue. And yet to thinke that Gold and Siluer mynes are in a Countrey (otherwise most rich and fruitfull) the greatest wealth of a Plantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, That the Gold and Siluer is the greatest wealth of the West Indies now at this present time. True it is indeed, that in the first Conquest the Spaniards ",
    "1848": "1622 563  got great and mighty treasure from the Indians, which they in long space had heaped vp together, [82] and in those times the Indians shewed them entyre and plentifull rich mynes, which by length of time (as is well known and published to the world by those that haue beene there) are wasted and exhausted since, so as now the charge of getting those mettals is growne most excessiue, besides the consuming and spoyling many men of their liues, which are depriued of them by the vapors that come out of the Gold and Siluer mynes, which are most pestilent and deadly, as diuers authors auerre. Amongst others, a late Geographer speaking of the West Indies, and of those mynes there, saith, Odor ex auri & argenti fodinis noxius admodum; neq; tamen prohibuit a\u00e9ris corruptissimi violentia Hispanos, ne in alto orbe nouum moriendi locum quaeerent. So as all things considered by these mynes, what by the liues of many men lost in them, and what with the great charge otherwise in getting them, the cleare gaine to the Aduenturers from these mettals (the Kings part defrayed) is but small! to them, nothing neere so much I am sure, as is imagined. And were it not for other rich Commodities there that enable and enrich the Aduenturers, those of the Contractation house were neuer able to subsist by this. Tor the greatest part of their gaine and profit I say consists not in these mynes, but in their other Commodities, partly natiue, and partly translated from other parts of the world, and planted in the West Indies: As in their mighty wealth of Sugars (the Sugar-Canes being transported first from the Ca- naries,) and in Ginger, and some other commodities deriucd from the East Indies thither: in their Cochanile, their Indico, their Cotton, their infinite store of Hydes and Skins, [33] their Quick-siluer, and Allom, Woad, and Brasillwood, &c. And their many other Dyes, Paints, Petacaraua, Tobacco, Gummes, Balmes, Oyles medecinall, and Perfumes, their Sar- saparillia, and many other physicall drugs, (for which, learned Physitians and skilfull Simplers were sent to take a suruey, and make an exquisite draught of all the Plants in colours.) These I say and other the like com- modities are the West Indies indeed vnto the Aduenturers, by which they are inabled to inrich themselues, and to sustaine the mighty charge of drawing out the Gold and Siluer, to the great and cleare reuenew of their  King.  I had many things of importance to say more, but I will detain the Reader no longer now. \u2018To conclude then, secing that Virgrnia is most abundantly ",

Wherein no doubt but all the fauour that may be, shall be shewed to Aduenturers and Planters. And for old Aduenturers, there is due vnto them and their heyres (according to the Orders of the Company) for each twelue pounds ten shillings formerly paid [84] into the treasury, one hundred Acres of Land, vpon a first diuision, and as much vpon a second, the first being planted. And whosceuer transports himselfe or any other, at his charge into VIRGINIA, shall for himselfe and each person so transported, before Midsummer, 1625. haue to him and his heyres foreuer, fifty Acres of land vpon a first Diuision, and as much more vpon a second: the first fifty being cultiuated or manured, if such person continue there three yeares, eyther at once or seuerall times, or dye after hee bee shipped for that Voyage.  Lastly, it is to be wished, that euery good Patriot will take these things seriously into his thoughts, and consider how deeply the prosecution of this noble Enterprise concerneth the honor of his Mazestie and the whole Nation, the propagation of Christian Religion, the enlargement, strength, and safety of his Maiesties Dominions, the rich augmenting of his Reuen- nues, the imploiment of his Subiects idle at home, the increase of men, Mariners and shipping, and the raising of such necessary commoditie, for the importation of which from forren Countries so great and ineredible summes are continually issued and expended. Some may helpe with their purses, some with their persons, some with their fauour, some with their counsell: especially amongst others, let Ministers in their publike and priuate prayers commend these Plantations to the blessing of Almighty God: To whom be all honor and glory, for euer and euer, Amen.

    "1857": "572 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  A TREATISE or THE NoRTHWEST PassaGE TO THE SOUTH SEA, THROUGH THE Continent or VIRGINIA anv BY Fretum Hudson  The noble Plantation of VIRGINIA hath some very excellent Prerogatiues aboue many other famous Kingdomes, namely, the temperature of the ayre, the fruitfulnesse of the soile, and the commodiousnesse of situation.  The ayre is healthfull and free both from immoderate heate, and from extreame cold; so that both the inhabitants and their cattell doe prosper exceedingly in stature and strength, and all Plants brought from any other remote climate, doe there grow and fructifie in as good or better manner, then in the soyle from whence they came. Which though it doe manifestly proue the fruitfulnesse of the soile, yeelding all kinds of graine or plants committed vnto it, with a rich and plentifull encrease, yet cannot the fatnesse of the earth alone produce such excellent effects, vnlesse the tem- perature of the Ayre bee likewise so fauourable, that [46] those tender sprouts which the earth doth abundantly bring forth, may bee cherished with moderate heate and seasonable moisture, and freed both from scorching drought, and nipping frost.  These blessings are so much the more to bee esteemed, because they are bestowed vpon a place situated so conueniently, and at so good a distance both from Europe, and the West Indies, that for the mutuall commerce betwixt these great and most rich parts of the habitable world, there cannot bee deuised any place more conuenient for the succour and refresh- ing of those that trade from hence thither: whether they be of our owne nation, or of our neighbours and friends; the multitude of great and naui- gable Riuvers, and of safe and spacious harbours, as it were inuiting all Nations to entertaine mutuall friendship, and to participate of those bless- ings which God out of the abundance of his rich Treasures, hath so gratiously bestowed some vpon these parts of Hurope, and others no lesse desired vpon those poore people: which might still haue remained in their old barbarous ignorance, without knowledge of their owne misery, or of Gods infinite goodnesse and mercy; if it had not pleased God thus gratiously both to draw vs thither with desire of such wealth as those fruitfull Coun- tries afford, and also to grant vs so easie, certaine, and safe a meanes to goe vuto them: which passage is in mine opinion made much more secure ",
    "1858": "1622 573  and easie by the commodious harbours and refreshing which VIRGINIA doth reach out vnto vs. The coasts of Florida to the West, being not so har- borous; and of New England to the East, somewhat more out of the way, amongst so many [47] Flats and small [lands not so safe. Neither is the com- modiousnesse of VIRGINIAS situation onely in respect of this west Alan- ticke Ocean, but also in respect of the Indian Ocean, which wee commonly call the South Sea, which lyeth on the West and North west side of VIRGINIA, on the other side of the Mountains beyond our Fals, and openeth a free and faire passage, not onely to China, Tapan, and the Moluccaes; but also to New Spaine, Peru, Chila, and those rich Countries of Terra Australis, not as yet fully discouered. For the Sea wherein Master Hudson did winter, which was first discouered by him, and is therefore now called Mretum Hudson, doth stretch so farre towards the west, that it lieth as farre westward as the Cape of Florida: So that from the Fals aboue Henrico City, if we shape our iourney towards the Northwest following the Rivers towards the head, we shall vndoubtedly come to the Mountaines, which as they send diuers great Riuers Southward into our Bay of Chesepiock, so likewise doe they send others from their further side Northwestward into that Bay where Hudson did winter. For so wee see in our owne Country, from the ridge of Mountaines continued from Derbishire into Scotland, doe issue many great Riuers on both sides into the East Germane Ocean, and into the Westerne /rzsh Seas: in like sort from the Alpes of Switzerland and the Grizons, do runne the Danubie Eastward into Pontus Euxinus, the Rhene into the North Germane Ocean, the Rhosne west into the Mediterrane Sea, and the Po South into the Adriatike Sea. This Bay where //udson did winter, strecheth it selfe Southward into 49. degrees, and cannot be in probability so farre dis[48]tant from the Fals as 200. Leagues; part of the way lying by the Riuers side towards the mountaines from whence it springeth: and the other part on the other side cannot want Riuers likewise, which will conduct vs all the way, and I hope carry vs and our prouisions a good part of it. Besides that Bay, it is not vnlikely that the Westerne Sea in some other Creeke or Riuer commeth much neerer then that place: For the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter, lying more Westerly then Master Hudsons Bay by 190. Leagues in the same Sea, doth extend it selfe very neere as farre towards the west as the Cape of California,  which is now found to be an Iland stretching it selfe from 22. degrees to 42. 1982-3338 ",
    "1859": "574 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  and lying almost directly North & South; as may appeare in a Map of that Tland which I haue seene here in London, brought out of Holland; where the Sea vpon the Northwest part may very probably come much nearer then some do imagine: who giuing too much credit to our vsuall Globes and Maps, doe dreame of a large Continent extending it selfe farre Westward to the imagined Straight of Anian, where are seated (as they fable) the large Kingdomes of Cebola and Quiuira, hauing great and populous Cities of ciuill people; whose houses are said to bee fiue stories high, and to haue some pillars of Turguesses. Which relations are cunningly set downe by some vpon set purpose to put vs out of the right way, and to discourage such as otherwise might bee desirous to search a passage by the way afore- said into those Seas.  Gerardus Mercator, a very industrious and excellent Geographer, was abused by a Map sent vnto him, of foure Huripi meeting about the North Pole; which [49] now are found to be all turned into a maineicie Sea. One demonstration of the crafty falshood of these vsuall Maps is this, that Cape Mendocino is set in them West Northwest, distant from the South Cape of California, about seuenteene hundred Leagues, whereas Francis Gaule that was imployed in those discoueries by the Viseroy of New Spaine; doth in Hugo Linscotten his booke set downe their distance to bee onely fiue hundred Leagues.  Besides this, in the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter in 57. de- grees of latitude, the constant great tides euery twelue houres, and the in- crease of those tides whensoeuer any strong westerne wind did blow, doe strongly perswade vs that the maine Westerne Ocean is not farre from thence; which was much confirmed vnto them the Summer following; when sayling directly North from that place where they wintered, about the Latitude of 60. degrees, they were crossed by a strong Currant running sometimes Eastward, sometimes Westward: So that if wee finde either Hudsons Bay, or any Sea more neere vnto the West, wee may assure our selues that from thence wee may with great ease passe to any part of the Fast Indies: And that as the world is very much beholding to that famous Columbus for that hee first discouered vnto vs the West Indies; and to the Portingall for the finding out the ordinary and as yet the best way that is knowne to the Hast Indies, by Cape Bona-Speranza.

And this hope that the South Sea may easily from VIRGINIA be diseouered ouer Land, is much confirmed by the constant report of the Sauages, not onely of VIRGINIA, but also of Florida and Canada; which dwelling so remote one from another, and all agreeing in the report of a large Sea to the West- wards, where they describe great Ships not vnlike to ours, with other cir- cumstances, doe giue vs very great probability (if not full assurance) that our endeuours this way shall by Gods blessing haue a prosperous and happy successe, to the encrease of his Kingdome and glory amongst these poore ignorant Heathen people, the publique good of all the Christian world, the neuer-dying honour of our most gracious Soueraigne, the inestimable benefit of our Nation, and the admirable and speedy increase and aduanee- ment of that most noble and hopefull Plantation of VIRGINIA; for the good successe whereof all good men with me, I doubt not, will poure out their prayers to Almighty God.
