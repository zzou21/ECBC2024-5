    "273": "62 INTRODUCTION  Sir Nathaniel was a leader in the Warwick faction, while Earl Robert, after the dissolution of the company in 1624, became a member of the council for Virginia. The third wife of the Earl was Eleanor, Countess of Sussex, daughter of Richard Wortley, and she, after the death of the Earl of Warwick, married, as her fourth husband, Edward Montague, second Earl of Manchester. Thus it is that the Kimbolton manuscripts, which are the records of the Duke of Manchester, contain a large collection of petitions, declarations, memoranda, letters, and lists which emanated from the Warwick faction of the Virginia Company.* Many of these are holographs of Nathaniel Rich and Alderman Johnson, prime movers in that conflict. Henry Montague, Viscount Mandeville and later Karl of Manchester, was at one time lord president of the Privy Council. Therefore many of the Manchester papers may have belonged to him. The autographs, however, identify those which concern the Virginia Company as having belonged to Nathaniel Rich.  The Manchester and the Ferrar papers therefore present the two sides of this conflict, not in open court or even in private contest, but in the private documents and memoranda of the leaders. The collections are of about the same size, there being sixty-six papers in the Manchester series, to seventy-eight in the Ferrar group. These, also, are unbound, but since the greater part are rough notes of documents, or drafts of propositions or speeches, they are much more difficult to decipher than the Ferrar papers. Indeed many of them are almost illegible, and not a few are unintelligible, having no connecting thought.  A dozen of these papers may be considered documentary; that is, rough copies of letters, petitions, and declarations, or of acts of the company, or of its members and officers in an official capacity. A few of these only are to be found among the other records of the company. Like the rest of the set, they, almost without exception, concern the accusations against the Sandys-Southampton management. Three of them are petitions or letters concerning the extent of the tobacco trade, but the rest are petitions to the King against one faction or the other, and answers to those petitions. Of these, one of the most important is a copy of the opinion of counsel concerning the powers conferred on the Virginia Company by the several letters patent.? Accusation and defense are set forth in these documents, but the headings of speeches, the drafts of propositions, and the notes from docu- ments on which the arguments are based proclaim the motives and methods of the accusers. No proof could be clearer than these memoranda by Alderman Johnson and Nathaniel Rich that the company was to be overthrown by fair means or foul.

In these criticisms and drafts of propositions much information is afforded concerning the management, organization, and condition of the colony and com- pany. Thus, various books kept by the company during Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s time, and not otherwise known, are mentioned.\u201c Five or six rough drafts of propositions concerning the tobacco and salary question are also to be found here, as well as numerous statements of sums adventured, of the number of men sent to the colony, lists of members favorable to one faction or the other and candidates for office from both parties. Many of the rough notes of both Johnson and Rich furnish the only source of information concerning the directions given to the commissioners appointed by the Crown to investigate the condition of the company and of the colony and their acts and reports, but a fact of greater sig- nificance is this, that the Warwick collection contains a dozen rough drafts of directions to those commissioners, of charges against the company to be sent to that body, of preliminary reports concerning the government of Virginia, and of projects for the settlement of the government and the colony. The source of the schism is here revealed, and the accusation by Sandys that accuser and judge were one is justified.\u2019 COLONIAL AND DOMESTIC STATE PAPERS  The other large group of Virginia records, consisting of over one hundred and twenty separate documents, ix found among the colonial and domestic papers deposited in the Publie Record Office. The source of this collection is uncertain. Much of it came from the Plantation Office, and perhaps from the Privy Council Office. The consolidation of depositories took place in 1578, but the efforts of Dr. Thomas Wilson, the first clerk of the papers, to force the previous and incumbent magistrates to hand over all documents to the State, were evidently often unavailing, and hence it was that the creation of a State Paper Ottice was not really accomplished until the period of the company. After Sir Thomas Wilson succeeded his uncle during the reign of James I the aid of the King was much relied upon, and, though partially successful, the recent revelation of quasi- public documents in private collections shows that not only earlier but later officials considered papers of record private property.

Similarly, the Cottonian papers in the Museum originally belonged to Sir Robert Cotton in the time of James I.  Among the State Papers deposited in the Record Office are the letters to John Ferrar, dated from Virginia in April, 1623, which may have been seized by the commission appointed on May 9, 1623, to investigate the affairs of the com- pany. There, too, are found the attested copies of letters and records in the colony which concern the Harvey Commission, sent to the commission in England by Edward Sharpless. A few of these papers seem to have belonged to the company, such as the documents pertaining to the Walloons and dated 1621; Pory\u2019s report from Virginia, in the same year; and two copies of documents by Collingwood, dated the latter part of 1623.7 All of these facts lead to the con- clusion that a part of the records of the commissions, and a part of the confis- cated records of the company are here deposited. If so, where are the remainder of these most valuable documents? ?  The colonial papers and the domestic correspondence include about forty-eight which are records, and about nineteen which are documentary in character. The first group contains, among other papers, many of the petitions and letters addressed to the King and to the Privy Council, and many others of the council. It is thus apparent that the royal correspondence of the Privy Council and the Privy Council papers which should accompany the register are in this collection. To the second group belong those papers which contain projects presented by individuals and answers to such propositions, lists of adventures for the company, and also lists of men sent to the colony and of lands granted in Virginia. Among these papers are seven letters from colonists, in addition to about fifty which may be consid- ered subsidiary correspondence in that they refer incidentally to the affairs of the company. Such are the Mandeville-Conway, Middlesex-Conway, Chamberlain- Carleton, Conway-Calvert, and Nethersole-Carleton letters.  RECORDS OF COURTS  In the libels of the admiralty court, instance and prize, are found records of suits in which the Virginia Company is plaintiff.

Among the other formal material of the suit against Wye are two valuable documents, namely, the commission given to Wye and a letter from the treasurer and council to Sir George Yeardley, dated June 21, 1619. In the latter are valuable references to Argall, and the complaints against Wye, though torn and illegible, reveal something of the loss estimated as resulting from the failure to settle the passengers in Virginia. These records of the admiralty court have not hereto- fore been published, although they were cited by R. G. Marsden in his discussion of those documents.\u00a2 But the chancery files, which have furnished the records of suits by the Virginia Company, have only just been indexed, and hence the documents have not heretofore been known.  The record of the yuo warranto suit by which the Virginia Company was over- thrown has been erroneously declared to be not extant, a mistake due to a differ- ence in view with regard to the court out of which such a writ would be issued and as to the court in which the writ would be returnable. Hence the search for the document has hitherto been conducted in the Petty Bag of the Chancery instead of in the coram rege roll of the King\u2019s Bench. It was in the latter roll that the full record of the writ, the pleadings, and the judgment were discovered by the Editor in the fall of 1903.2 Int Guede to the Documents in the Public Record Office Mr. Bird gives the following explanation of the placita de quo warranto: They \u2018\u2018consist of the pleadings and judgments on writs of \u2018quo warranto\u2019 in nature of writs of right on behalf of the King against those who claimed or usurped any oftice, franchise, or liberty. The pleadings and judgments on writs of \u2018quo war- ranto\u2019 or of \u2018quo titulo clamat\u2019 took place in the King\u2019s Bench or the Exchequer and are enrolled on the \u2018coram rege rolls\u2019 or the \u2018memoranda rolls\u2019 accordingly.\u201d** \u2018The statement in the court book of the company is that the \u2018company had been served with process out of the King\u2019s Bench by virtue of a quo warranto.\u201d It was this clue and that from Mr. Seargill-Bird that led the Editor to conduct the search successfully in the coram rege roll.  In the Record Office are also the docquet books, which afford some knowledge of the grants of the King affecting the customs on tobacco, and the patent rolls,  @R. G.

In the colonial entry books and among the proclamations of the King are orders of the Privy Council and of the King, all of which are recorded in the Privy Council register.  PRIVY COUNCIL REGISTER  Since the Privy Council took no direct part in the affairs of the company between 1617 and the summer of 1622, its orders related to those regulations which would enable the acts of the company to advance the interests of the kingdom, leaving absolute power to the company as the proprietor. Thus fully one-half of its thirty measures during those five years were reprieves of prisoners, with the warrants nec- essary to send them to Virginia or orders enabling children to be transferred from the cities of the kingdom to the colony. During this period the Crown commenced its attempts to secure a revenue from the tobacco trade, and a series of orders finally resulted in the approval of the contract with the company in February of 1622 3. In its foreign and external relations the company was of course subject to the action of the Privy Council, and hence the orders in council concerned the contest with Spain over the attack of the 7reasurer. Furthermore, the disagreement with the northern colony concerning fishing privileges had to be adjusted by the council and resulted in the renewal of the patent to the northern colony and in regulations as to rights of fishing. It was in the summer of 1622 that the first movement was made which brought the difficulties between the factions into the open board. The petition of John Bargrave against Sir Thomas Smythe, Alderman Johnson, and others, in which they were accused of mismanagement, resulted in the defeat of Bargrave six months later, as was to have been expected from the hostility of the Crown to the party in Parliament led by Sir Edwin Sandys, of which Bargrave was evidently a member at that time. But the storm broke in the following April, when the commission was appointed to inquire into the true state of the Virginia and Somers Islands companies. From that date until the dissolution of the com- pany in the summer of 1624 the council busied itself with the affairs of the company. No less than 31 orders are recorded which create commissions and empower them to investigate both the colony and the company and in the end to assume the functions of government in the name of the Crown, while seven of these documents pass directly between the council and the colony, and no other measures were con- sidered except those which enabled the Warwick faction to tear down the work of the adventurers and to take into its own hands the control of the entire business. These forms of government, planned by the Crown and the commissions here recorded, by which the authority was vested in the commissioners and later in a committee of the Privy Council, stand for the beginning of royal control. Here- ",

The Privy Council Office and its records are located in the treasury building, Whitehall, London; the registers of the council orders are kept in the clerk\u2019s office but all of the early registers are properly about to be transferred to the Public Record Office. These registers contain the orders of the council, and, after Charles I, also the petitions received and the letters issued by the council. In the earlier reigns such documents were not recorded; whether they were even preserved as public documents is not certain, although, as stated above, many of them have found their way to the Record Office and are there calendared among the colonial, domestic, or foreign papers. There is a collection of such original material, dating from the close of the seventeenth century, in the treasury building.\u00ae  BRITISH MUSEUM  The collection of manuscripts from which the most valuable returns might be expected is in the British Museum. The documents there deposited are small in number but they are of great value, and none of them have heretofore been printed. The originals of the precedents for patents of the Virginia Company, which are now noted for the first time, evidently formed a part of the records of the company, and it may be that they are some of the copies of the records made under the supervision of Nicholas Ferrar, or they may be the drafts of patents which were filed by the company according to an order of its court. Not only is the writing similar to much of that in the contemporary transcripts of the court book, but they are unsigned copies, and the headings of a number of them seem to be in the autograph of Edward Collingwood. The caption of the series shows that the copies were made for the sake of preserving the form, and reads as follows: \u2018\u2018 Presidents of Patents, Grants & Commissioners by the Virginia Company. 1621.\u201d\u00b0 The company thus preserved the legal form of the various grants. Four of them are of value not only for the form but for the knowledge they furnish of the distinction made between the four classes of adventurers: those who paid money into the treasury and agreed to plant one hundred persons, those who established a private plantation, those who were private planters, and those whose \u2018\u2018shares exceedinge 50 acf are exempted from payinge any Rent to y\u00ae Company for the persons they transporte.\u201d In addition certain knowledge is afforded concerning the grants.

Another is a covenant by the company to pay for the victualing and transporting of passengers, while still another is for the transporting of goods only. Other forms are those used for granting rights of fishing on the coast of America, for voyages to Virginia, and free fishing along the shores, and others still for discovery, fishing, and trading in furs in Virginia. The covenant signed by William Ewens in which he agreed to fit out the ship George reveals the form of contract required of the masters of ships by the company.

    "280": "THE COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS, 1616-1624 69  Two other projects for the advancement of the colony are in the same collection of papers; one by Captain Bargrave, brother of the Dean of Canterbury, is dated December 8, 1623, and the other a year later. The latter relates to the division of income from tobacco between the King, the planter, and the grower, with a reward to those endeavoring to preserve the plantation, but approves the Ditchfield offer. The Ditchfield offer itself is also in this collection.* Captain Bargrave\u2019s proposition for the government of the colony stands midway between absolute royal control and full autonomy of the planters, and holds an important place in the develop- ment of the plans from the proprietary to the royal colony. Furthermore, it is rather significant that in the collection of Sir Julius Cesar are to be found the propo- sitions of Martin, of Bargrave, and the document by which the commission was finally appointed in 1624, to establish the government in Virginia under royal control. Sir Julius Cesar, having been a judge of admiralty under Elizabeth and chancellor of the exchequer in the reign of James I, became master of the rolls on January 16, 1610/11, and one of the keepers of the great seal on May 3, 1621. His position evidently enabled him to secure a large collection of valuable drafts of documents. This was sold at auction in 1757. One-third of the collection was purchased by the Karl of Shelburne (Lord Lansdowne) from Webb and came to the Museum among the Lansdowne papers.  Two collections of printed material of the company are to be found in England, the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries. While the British Museum has a large number of the earlier publications, it possesses only the declaration of June 22, 1620, and also the unique note of shipping of 1620, the only other copy of which is owned by the Society of Antiquaries. The collection of that society is rich in royal proclamations, besides possessing a copy of the Note of Shipping, 1621, and of the Zneonvenrences of 1622.

Che Records of the Company under the Sandys-Southampton Administration  ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY  In order to comprehend what the records of the company were and what their value, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the system which the corporation worked out in order to further its purposes. The forms and usages of the company after 1619 were determined by the charters granted by the King and by the \u2018* Orders and Constitutions\u201d which it adopted in 1619 and printed in June, 1620,\u00a2 although the latter were altered or newly interpreted from time to time by action of its courts.  The membership of the company was unlimited and was granted by the courts to anyone who had \u2018\u201c\u2018adventured\u201d \u00a312 10s. for a share of stock or to whom the com- pany had awarded a share of stock for services.\u2019 The distinction between a member who was free of the company and an owner of Jand in Virginia was brought out in a controversy on February 19, 1622 3, in which a proposition to limit the adventurers to those approved by the generality met with opposition on the ground that land in Virginia was held in free and common socage and could not be forbidden to any man. But Sir John Brooke, the legal authority in the company, declared that such exclusion was agreeable to the law since it was a question of a vote ina court and nota ques- tion of ownership of land. The argument was based on the power to withhold the privilege of voting from Samuel Wroth, who was under censure, and similarly on the power to exclude any man who had purchased Jand from a member who was indebted to the company until the debts were paid. This discussion also revealed that no oath of fidelity was required in the Virginia Company as in the Muscovy and other corporations. Ata later date the King proposed that no member should be free of the courts who had not sent men to the colony as planters, claiming that less than thirty of the adventurers could meet the requirement.\u2018 The power to dis- franchise an unworthy member was reserved to the company.  aList of Records, No 183. oMS.

    "282": "72 INTRODUCTION  The members met in four great or quarter courts, held on the last Wednesday except one of each law term. On the Monday preceding they assembled in a prepar- ative court and on every Wednesday fortnight thereafter in a common or ordinary court, as required by the charter of 1612; and they might also be summoned to an extraordinary court by the treasurer or deputy. The meetings were held in the private houses of various members of the company\u201c until the time of the tobacco contract, when a company house was established.  In the quarter court the adventurers elected all councilors and principal officers of the company and colony, made all laws and ordinances, confirmed all grants of land, settled all questions of trade, and passed all measures which should bind the company for a termof years. Their action with regard to questions of a new charter and of investment for the colony was legal only when transacted in a quarter court, but they might transfer to other courts actions which concerned correspondence with the lord treasurer or similar business. Fifteen of the generality and five of the council formed a quorum for the ordinary courts, and in those they signed warrants, ordered the payment of bills passed by the auditors, and sealed bills of adventure. In that meeting also were perfected commissions for transportation of men and provisions and for trade and barter. Special officers and committees were appointed in this court, and even actions of great importance, such as the dissolution of the magazine or the extension of freedom of the company to hon- orary members, were consummated.\u2019  The officers chosen by the company were a council, a treasurer, a deputy, auditors, a general committee of sixteen, a secretary, a bookkeeper, a husband, and a beadle. The adventurers looked to the treasurer or governor not only as the president and moderator, but as the manager of their business interests, and expected him to be responsible for the policy of the company in its relations with the govern- ment and to formulate and present plans for the development of the plantation and the profit of the adventurers. To him was entrusted the supervision of the treasury and the collection of moneys.  The care of the court books was given to the deputy. It was his duty to attend to the engrossing of the orders and resolutions of the courts, the registration of letters to and from the company, and the formulation of statements to be given to the public. He also kept the court of the committees and supervised the issue of warrants.  The council was a body, gradually increasing in size, elected for life, and was sworn by the lord chancellor or by the lord chamberlain. In the earlier years it was the most important committee of the generality of the company, but after 1621 its  @ MS.

According to the \u2018\u2018Orders and Constitutions\u201d its chief care was the preparation of laws for the company and for the colony, the issue of instructions to the governor and council of the colony, and the formation of a preliminary court for the trial of the officers of the company or of the colony. But the practice in the courts was to refer to it those difficult duties for which its titled and distinguished personnel made it especially fit. \u2018To it was referred, as a tinal resort, the examination of the claims of John Martin, the attempts to gain a statement of accounts from the old magazine, and the settlement or arbitration of both the Bargrave and the Argall cases. \u00a2  A body called the \u2018\u2018committees\u201d was at first composed of twelve members, six being chosen annually, but later the number was increased to sixteen, four being elected anew each year.\u201d Its duties were chiefly to attend to the buying and selling of the commodities of the company, and to the furnishing of ships departing for Virginia.  The auditors formed the other important standing committee, composed of seven members, elected annually. The chief duty assigned to them by the *\u2018 Orders and Constitutions\u201d was that of reducing to a book the receipts and expenditures. The court book discloses the fact that the company imposed upon them the burden of examining all claims against the company, as well as all claims of the company, of investigating the accounts of the lottery and of the magazine, of determining the awards of land or of shares for service or for adventure, of perfecting all patents and grants, and even of investigating controversies, such as the Bargrave and Martin cases and the dispute as to the seal and coat of arms.\u00a2  The other ofticers performed such duties as usually pertain to those who hold the corresponding titles.@  As the business of the company increased additional officers were chosen, as those for the control and execution of the lotteries and of the tobacco contract; while the custom of referring important matters to special committees grew rapidly. until in the later years many duties were transferred to them from the council, and even from the auditors.

That the forms and usages followed in other com- mercial companies, in other corporate bodies, and in Parliament greatly influenced the decisions of the company is seen in the following illustrations: The question as to the entry in the minutes of the names of dissenters or of reasons disallowed by the court except by special order was thus settled according to the practice in Parliament; to prove that individual adventurers would not be liable for the debts of the company in the management of the tobacco magazine, decisions were cited both in a case inyolving the corporation of Norwich, and in the insolvency of the Muscovy Company; when the question arose as to salaries in the tobacco business involving \u00a3100,000, the precedent furnished by all joint stocks of no greater capital than \u00a37,000 was brought forward; the custom of private corporations as well as of judicial bodies of imposing a fine upon any man who spoke against the judge or the court was urged by Lord Brooke as a proper action to be taken against Samuel Wroth.\u00b0 Elections were conducted by ballot, except for the council, in which case, as in all other matters, the will of the court was determined by an \u201cerection of hands.\u201d  The reward for services rendered by the officers was determined by the court and set down in the Orders and Constitutions. The annual payment to the secre- tary was \u00a320, to the beadle \u00a340, to the husband \u00a350, and to the bookkeeper \u00a350. Although the chief officials and committees received no salary, at the expira- tion of the year\u2019s term of office it was customary to award 20 acres of land in Virginia to each individual, with the provision that such land should not be sold. The company similarly rewarded individuals who had rendered great service, but sometimes it granted shares of stock instead, or agreed to transport for the indi- vidual a certain number of men free of charge. Shares thus given could not be sold below par value of \u00a312 10s.\u00a2 Each share carried with it the privilege of a vote in  @ Court Book, July 18, December 15, 1619; March 2, 1619/20; June 26, July 7, 12, November 15, December 13, 1620; July 3, October 7, November 6, 1622.  6 Ibid., I, Jan. 31, 1619/20.  \u00a2 Ibid., II, Dec. 11, 1622; Jan. 14, 1623; Feb. 4, 1622/23; Dec. 11, 1622.  4 Tbid., I, June 28, 1620; November 15, 1620; May 2, 1621.

In addition, the sending of a man to the plantation before midsummer of 1625 entitled the adventurer to 50 acres of land on each division. If a planter had adventured his person only, after three years\u2019 residence in the colony the company gave him one share of stock; or if a resident in England had sent a man to the colony who had remained there three years, the one who bore the charge was simi- Jarly rewarded. Through reward or by purchase an individual might thus own land and not possess stock, but he might secure the latter within three years by \u2018* plant- ing\u201d or peopling his land. The result was that there were tive classes of individuals connected with the company.  (1) The old adventurer who had paid at least \u00a312 10s. for a share of stock, and who thus owned, rent free, at least 100 acres of land after the tirst division which took place in 1616.  (2) The new adventurer who had exactly the same privileges, except that after  seven years he must pay 12d. to the company for each 50 acres gained by trans portation of settlers,  (3) The adventurer who received a share of stock for service or for adventure of person and who would have the privileges of an old or of a new adventurer according to whether he received the award before or after 1619.  (4) The individual who had received a grant of land for service or who had purchased land and had not yet gained the grant of shares of stock by adventure of his person or by sending out planters.  (5) The individual who had purchased land of a debtor of the company and could not become free of the courts until the debts were paid.  It will thus be seen that ownership of land and possession of freedom of the company were not always coexistent, but that each involved the possibility of the other. No assessments were ever levied upon the shareholders, the first sugges- tion of such a course coming from the Privy Council in July, 1623.\u00b0  RECORDS PROVIDED FOR BY THE COMPANY  The company was thus 2 body of adventurers, who had gained the freedom of the company by payment of money, by rendering a service, or by settlement of land in Virginia.

Provision was thus made for six books which were to contain the following records:  (1) Copies of the letters patents, and also of all letters, orders, and directions from the King and his council, as well as the replies of the company.  (2) The laws and standing orders passed in quarter courts for the company and for the colony.  (3) A register of all patents, charters, and indentures of validity granted by the company, of all instructions issued by the council, and of all public letters sent to or received from Virginia.  (4) The acts of the general courts.  (5) The acts of the committees; invoices of provisions sent to Virginia by the company; the certificates of the receipts to be returned from Virginia; invoices of goods sent from Virginia with the husband's certificate of receipt or defect.  (6) The names of adventurers, by payment of money or by rendering service, to whom shares of land had been given, together with the number of shares belonging to each person; the lawful transfers of shares from one to another; the names of His Majesty\u2019s council for Virginia.

In his custody also were the husband's books of accounts of every voyage to Virginia, all accounts approved by the auditors, the canceled and uncanceled charter parties, and all bonds issued to the company.  The proof of the care with which the company kept its records is found in the contemporary copy of the court book, and in a few scattering originals and copies of originals which are preserved among the Ferrar and Manchester papers and in the British Museum. That all of the books required by the orders and constitutions were really kept can not be proved, since not a page nor a copy of a page of many of them is known to be extant; but the copy of the court book serves as an evidence that the laws were as carefully obeyed in this respect as in others. The references in the minutes to many of these records, the inser- tion of many of them in the copy of the court book, and the continual provision for supplementary records all go to show that the \u2018\u2018Orders and Constitutions\u201d furnish a reliable outline of the records kept by the company.  \u00a2A note of such a list of men sent to Virginia during the time of Sir Thos.

Imme- diately upon assuming his duties us treasurer, Sir Edwin Sandys instituted an investigation of the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe. In this connection four books and four rolls were prepared containing the subseriptions, which had been made for carrying on the business, and a list of the adventurers with the sums invested during the previous years. The treasurer made a similar request of the deputy, John Ferrar, on September 18, 1620, in which he asked that the secretary and Mr. Carter should make three catalogues of the adventurers indebted to the company in order that they might be given to a solicitor for collection. He throws light upon the customary carelessness by urging that the lists should be made \u2018\u2018from the company\u2019s books and not from memory,\u201d lest many a \u00a312 10s should be lost.\u00a2  On May 17, 1620, three books of the deputy were audited. The first contained an account of the money disbursed for provisions, the second, a catalogue of the provisions sent to the colony, and the third, a list of the names of the persons dispatched to the plantation with the trade of each. Because of the erection of private plantations in later years it was necessary that these records should be supplemented. Hence an order of court provided that the names of all persons transported to Virginia should be reported to the company and that a bookkeeper should be appointed to be at the house of the court to register the names before the departure of every ship. This record was to consist of the name, age, country, profession, and kindred of each individual and was to state at whose charge the transportation was effected. Contrary to custom each person was required to pay a fee for registration. A duplicate of the register was to be sent to the Governor of Virginia, but the names of those departing were not to be made public until after the ship had sailed.\u00a2  Provision was made in 1620 for keeping duplicates of all patents issued. A part of this series is now deposited in the British Museum, from which the various kinds of patents and the terms for each may be discovered.? A registra- tion of all shares passed from one member of the company to another was ordered on November 19, 1621, and such a book was to be used as evidence of the right to be admitted to courts.

Nine are mentioned in the court book on July 24, 1621, in addition to others cited at various times.\u00b0  With the increase in trade and the establishment of the company magazines new measures were adopted for controlling the business. These often consisted of separate documents rather than books. A statement was thus required of the deputy certifying that the freight had been paid before any goods should be delivered, and invoices were also demanded of the cape merchant.? Copies of such certificates, as also of the accounts of the treasurer of the various joint stock investments for the glass works and for the fur trade, were kept in the company\u2019s chest.\u00a2  THE EXTANT RECORDS\u2014THE COURT BOOK HISTORY OF THE CONTEMPORARY COPY  The paucity of the actual extant documents of the company has made the circumstances of the transcription of the court book the more interesting and its authenticity the more important.  As the growing controversy between the two factions of the company resulted in serious accusations of mismanagement by sundry adventurers and planters, the Crown soon appointed a commission to investigate the affairs of the company, witha consequent sequestering of all of the company\u2019s court books in May, 1623/ The clear mind of Nicholas Ferrar immediately foresaw the danger of a seizure of the documents of the company, and appreciating full well the value of the \u2018\u2018 court books, registers and writings, instructions, letters, etc.,\u201d as political papers and also as evidences of the possession of land and investment of capital, upon their return by the Privy Council, he \u2018\u2018did fairly copy out all the court books, etc. (which cost 50\") and carried them to the noble Earle of Southampton.\u201d  @Court Book, II, Oct. 23, 1622.  bIbid., II, Nov. 18, 1622; Nov. 20, 1622.  eIbid., I, May 8, 1622; II, July 4, 1623.  4 Jbid., I, Apr. 3, 1620.  eIbid., I, Jan. 16, 1621-22; Feb. 27, 1621-22.

The time not taken in attendance \u2018\u2018twice or thrice a week\u201d upon the Privy Council, and in the attempts to defend the company against the charges of *\u2018abuse of its privileges,\u201d was evidently devoted to supervising the transcript of the com- pany\u2019s records. The attestation at the end of each volume shows that the first was completed January 28, 1623/4, and the second June 19, 1624.2. This was none too soon, for just a week later the Privy Council ordered Deputy Ferrar to bring to the council chamber all patents, books of accounts, invoices of the company, and lists of settlers in the colony, to be retained by the Privy Council chest until further notice.\u00a9 A commission had been appointed two days before to take into their hands all \u2018\u2018 charters, letters patent, grantes and instructions, bookes, orders, letters, advices and other writings concerning the company.\u201d\u201c The com- pany urged in these words that the council should permit the books to remain invio- late: \u2018\u2018So by this meanes [that is, by the transcripts] have the Original Court bookes yet escaped purging: And w\u2122 all duety wee humbly beseech yo\" Lop* that they may hereafter be protected from it: And that howsover yo\" Lop\" shall please for the future to dispose of the Companie, that the records of their past Actions may not be corrupted & falsified.\u201d Further, when the council demanded that the Earl of Southampton should surrender to the commissioners his copies of the records, before he sailed for the Netherlands in August, he sent them word, \u2018\u2018 that he would as soon part w\u2122 the evidences of his Land, as w\u2122 the said copies, being the evidence of his honour in that Service.\u201d \u00a2  How these transcripts were made, and especially what became of them at that time, and where they remained for the following half century can be a matter of  @Peckard, Memoirs of the Life of Mr. Nicholas Ferrar, pp, 89-167.  \u00bb According to the attestation two full courts were omitted, May 30, 1620, and June 1, 1622, and also a part of May 20, 1620. The Robinson abstracts comprise a little more than about one-half of the original records and are much more complete for the later years when the controversy with the King over the tobacco contract and the abuses of the company was being carried on. The part of the court book which reveals most with regard to internal organization, commercial activity, and inner life of the company is not included in these abstracts. Thus such data as that which concerns the trouble with Spain over the Treasurer, the suit with William Wye, the accusations against Samuel Argall, the old magazine, the Pierce patent, and many other private grants are not included. More- over, a comparison of the publication with the original manuscript shows that the John Randolph of Roanoke copy was used almost exclusively, and many inaccuracies have resulted.  \u00a2Order of the Privy Council, June 26, 1624: List of Records, No. 689.  \u00abThe commission was sealed July 15, 1624: Ibid., No. 701,  \u00a2For these quotations sce Discourse of the Old Company of Virginia addressed to the Lords of the Privy Council, April, 1625.

These are three in number: (1) The Discourse of the Old Company of Virginia addressed to the Privy Council, May, 1625. (2) The Memoirs of the Life of Nicholas Ferrar by Dr. Peckard in 1790, (8) A Short Collection of the Most Remarkable Passages from the originall to the dissolution of the Virginia Company, by Arthur Woodnoth, written between 1635 and 1645, and printed in 1651 by Richard Cotes.\u00a2  The Discourse of the Old Company gives much the same history of the records us does Dr. Peckard. The facts set forth by the latter were taken from the \u2018* Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar\u201d by his brother John, about 1654, and therefore this work may be considered as based on contemporary authority. According to Dr. Peckard, Nicholas Ferrar, knowing that malice was at work, procured a clerk to copy out all the court books and other writings and caused them to be carefully collated with the original. It cost him the sum of \u00a350, which he thought was the best service he could render the company. After the seizure of all the muniments of the company, and after Lord Treasurer Middlesex had procured sentence against the company, Mr. Ferrar informed Sir Edward Sandys and others of what he had done. These men were greatly rejoiced and advised that the copies be taken to the Earl of Southampton, who was so overcome that he is said to have embraced Mr. Ferrar and to have declared that he valued them as an evidence of his honor more than as evidences of his land. John Ferrar is quoted as having stated that the Earl of Southampton was advised not to keep these records in his house and so delivered them to Sir Robert Killigrew, who left them on his death to Sir Edward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset. Mr. Ferrar continues that the Earl of Dor- set died in 165%, but he hopes the records are still in the possession of the Earl\u2019s family. ?  Certain it is that Dr. Peckard had a large collection of manuscripts which concerned the Virginia Company, some of which must be considered a part of the records of the company, for such were the Ferrar papers described above which Dr. Peckard bequeathed to Magdalene College, Cambridge. That some of them, at least, came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family is to be concluded from the statement of Dr. Peckard that the \u2018*\u2018 Duke had had his library searched and found a few loose papers, which he sent to him.\u201d* Some of them doubtless belonged to Dr. Peckard\u2019s  \u00abThis pamphlet is in the volume entitled: Copy of a Petition from The Governor and Company of the Sommer Islands, with Annexed Papers, presented to the Right Honorable The Councel of State July the 19th, 1651.

But the story of the purchase of the two volumes from the estate of the Duke of Southampton by Colonel William Byrd in 1673 or 1688 for 60 guineas has firm credence through statements of Mr. Byrd himself; and there is no evidence that they came from the Earl of Dorset\u2019s family. That they were sent to Tichfield by the Earl of Southampton before he sailed for the Netherlands and there remained until his son\u2019s library was sold after his death in 1667 seems probable. Perhaps some of the other records went to Sir Robert Killigrew, as stated by John Ferrar, and even some from which these copies were made.  The statement by Woodnoth, who was a nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, that Sir John Danvers had the transcripts of the records made in order to keep out of the way an indigent man who had been employed by the company as a copyist and who might be persuaded to say something ill of Sandys and of Nouthampton. does not bear the stamp of truth or even of probability. There may have been a copy made by Danvers, but the internal evidence reveals that the existing volumes in the Library of Congress were not transcribed by any one man, and that the work was accomplished under the personal direction of Nicholas Ferrar.\u00a2  DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTEMPORARY COPY  The contemporary copies of the court books, which are now in the Library of Congress and which may well be called the Ferrar copies, consist of two volumes of large quarto size well bound in rough calf. About 1898 the books were boxed, that is, repaired with new backs without disturbing the sewing. The old labels were pasted on the new backs and bear the title in gold letters on red leather: Record of the Virgin: / Compan:\u2019, while gold letters on black leather indicate the volume: Vol. / I. / and Vol. / II. /. In the first volume manila strips are pasted from the inner cover to the first and to the last fly leaf in order to strengthen the binding. The paper is of the seventeenth century type, hand-made and uneven in texture. In the first volume there are three hundred and fifty-four pages, with five fly leaves in the front and seven in the back, while the second contains three hundred and eighty-seven pages preceded by three fly leaves and followed by four, with two extra manila pages in both the front and back. The pencil entries on the tirst leaf of the first volume are as follows: \u2018\u2018 Records of the / Virginia Company of London./ Vol I. April 28, 1619 to May 8, 1622./ Vol 2.

On the inside of the front cover of the second volume in an unknown modern autograph is: \u2018* p. 366 cf with p. 71 v 3,\u201d 4 and on the first manila leaf: \u2018\u2018 May 20, 1622 / to | June 7, 1624.\u201d  The discovery of the Ferrar papers has made it possible to make a final state- ment both as to the method of the transcription of the documents and as to its accuracy, for the autographs there found of Nicholas Ferrar and also of his clerk or business agent in his private accounts prove indisputably that these two mien supervised and carried on the copying of the volumes.\u2019 Particularly in the second volume, where there are many entries of reports of committees, projects, objections, letters, petitions, declarations, and relations by the company or by individuals, the headings, the initial words, even the first line of each document, and sometimes entire documents are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The rest of the insertion is usually by his assistant, who was perhaps Thomas Collett, his nephew. All of the insertions in the first volume and about twenty in the second are entirely in the so-called Collett autograph, numbering about the same as those superintended by the deputy himself. The way in which these insertions are often crowded in, is evidence that they were copied from the original documents in spaces left for the purpose by the hired copyist.\u00b0  As to the identity of the other three or four distinct autographs, in which the remaining part of the volumes appear, nothing has been determined. The first and third copyists are distinctly different in style, while what appears as the writing of a fourth and a sixth clerk may possibly be identical with that of the first. With the exception of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar, the whole is clearly, carefully, and legibly written in the characteristic running hand of the period, resembling the chancery hand. The spelling, capitalization, and abbrevia- tions are distinctive and characteristic of each copyist. The use of curved lines to complete blank spaces at the end of the line, and often at the bottom and top of the page, shows the labor expended to make the transcript accurate and complete. The memoranda at the end of the volumes declare that the transcript had been carefully collated with the original \u2018\u2018courte booke\u201d and with the authentic docu- ments by the secretaries, Edward Waterhouse and Edward Collingwood, in the first volume, and by Thomas Collett and Edward Collingwood in the second. That the insertions were copied from the original documents is shown by the statement  \u00ab The letter on page 366 is identical with that on page 71 of the fragile seventeenth century papers referred to above as Vol. III, pt. ii, of the Records of the Virginia Company.  \u00bb For examples of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar and of that of his assistant, Thomas Collett (?), see the plates in this volume.  \u00abFor the documents thus inserted in the Court Book see List of Records under \u2018\u2018 Reference.\u201d For an illustration of the insertion of the documents see the plates in this volume.

Many pages reveal the corrections of errors or omissions of the copyist. In most instances this was done by Edward Collingwood himself, though sometimes by Thomas Collett.\u00a2 At the bottom of cach page is the signature **Cone Collingwood,\u201d the abbreviation standing for concordat, as is shown by the word appearing as \u2018\u2018Concord:\u2019 on page three hundred and fifteen of the first volume.?  In addition to this internal evidence of accuracy, further proof of the care with which the books were transcribed is found among the Ferrar papers. The records of four courts were there discovered, which are almost identical with those of the same date in the Library of Congress volumes.\u2018 The only ditterences, and these are not numerous, are those which would naturally result from the fallibility of the copyist, and the apparent custom of the time to ignore the orthography of the original. One is led to believe that these loose pages of courts form a part of the book from which the copy was made. This is shown by the use of larger letters to emphasize certain words, and by Edward Collingwood\u2019s corrections of the Library of Congress copy to make it conform to these drafts. Even the omission of one or two lines in the Ferrar copy, later corrected, can be accounted for by reference to these sheets, since in each case it has resulted from the same word occurring in the same place on two successive lines. Furthermore, the directions in the margin of these courts as to where certain documents were to be entered were followed in the transcript and seem to point to these as a part of the original minutes. The autograph of the court held on June 25 is identical with that of the first copyist of the transcript, while the courts of July 4and July 9 were apparently written by the sixth copyist of the transcript. Among the Ferrar papers are two drafts of a resolution concerning the \u2018\u2018 Lo T\u00e9er speach touching M\u2019 Alderm. Johnson,\u201d which was entered in the court book. One is a rough draft written, altered, and corrected by Edward Collingwood, and bearing the above indorsement by the writer and a similar indorsement by John Ferrar.

Comparison between these records of courts and a draft of a Somers Islands court, in the same collection, leads to the conclusion that they do not forma part of the blotter or blurred book from which the original hook was made, since the latter are much corrected and altered and then canceled diagonally from corner to corner;? but are rather a part of the original book itself. The reliability of the Library of Congress transcripts is also confirmed by collating them with the original documents, or with other copies of the documents, which are inserted in the court book, and these careful comparisons have shown how accurately Edward Collingwood and _ his assistants conducted the work for Nicholas Ferrar.?  THE SYSTEM OF KEEPING THE COURT BOOK  The system by which the minutes of the courts were kept is thus outlined in the minutes; the court book was first drawn up by the secretary, was approved by the deputy, and later accepted or corrected by the court.\u00b0 That there must have existed a \u2018\u2018Blurr booke\u201d in addition to the various reports or other documents offered in any court is proved by an extract from a memorandum by Sir Nathaniel Rich, which is a warrant requiring all records of the court to be brought to the commissioners on Virginia, and includes the \u2018\u2018Court Bookes w should warrant the sd Record*, and the Blurr bookes w should warrant the Court Booke and is the first ground of the Record*; that it may [be] discouered whether there be any difference betweene them.\u201d\u201d The entries in the court book are the minutes of all the various courts, of several meetings of the Somers Islands Company, and of one meeting of the committees.  Introducing each court is a list of the adventurers in attendance. A comparison of the number with the number of votes cast as recorded shows that these are quite complete for the quarter courts, but in the ordinary courts either the attendance was very small or the entry was incomplete, since the list is often terminated with the expression \u2018\u2018and divers others.\u201d It was sometimes entered later than the transcript of the body of the text, as though from a book of attendance, but no mention of a roll book is found among the records.

The order of business does not seem to have been regular. The approval of the previous court is usually recorded first, although many times this is deferred until the quarter court; then follows the report of the treasurer, through which the important matters to be determined are presented to the court, and the hearing of petitions, passing of shares, and grants of land appear at the end of the session.  In the ordinary courts were propounded all of those matters which did not require action in the general court and often many measures for preliminary dis- cussion which were postponed for final action to the fuller court. Thus the records of the common courts and also of the preparative courts usually contain the full reports and discussions of the various subjects, while the statements in the quarter courts are brief and perfunctory, embodying the decisions reached in the lesser courts. The reports of officers, from which so much concerning the financial status is to be learned, are entered in the minutes of the general court. To trace the course of any question necessitates a search through all of the courts, but in the quarter courts will be found the elections and the final action on all laws and ordinances, on the patents for private plantations or monopolies, or, in short, on all measures by which the company would be bound for a term of years.  CONTENTS OF THE COURT BOOK  The business recorded during the first two years of the Sandys administration concerned the establishment of laws and orders in the company and in the colony, the systematizing of methods, the formation of joint stock companies for the erection of new industries in Virginia, and the opening up of new adventures. But after the massacre early in the year 1622, the whole tone of the book changes. Personal feuds and quarrels, complaints, and accusations fill the pages. Whether the friction was due to the extreme distress brought about by the attack of the Indians or whether it was but the excuse for open opposition by the party of the Crown, which had been rapidly developing, is difficult to determine. From the spring of 1622 until February, 1622/3, the burden of the record concerns the tohecco contract with the Crown. It resulted in the discussion of salaries for the officers and the quarrel with Samuel Wroth, which occupied the attention of the company for three mouths. Then followed the Butler and Johnson accusations, the investigation by the Crown, and the dissolution of the company. It is literally true that, after June, 1622, no new measures for trade, for industry, or for commerce are entered in the court book. There was the usual transferring of shares and hearing of petitions and claims, but the business activity was evidently destroyed. That the colony could survive the ",
    "296": "86 INTRODUCTION  massacre and continue its development with so little encouragement from the pro- prietor is evidence of the strong foundation laid during the governorship of Sir George Yeardley.  From the court book it would be possible to reconstruct a part or the whole of some of the other records, A list of all of the ships departing or arriving with the names of the masters could thus be drawn up, but the terms of the charter party could not be determined.* A full statement of the shares of stock granted or transferred, of the land assigned for adventure or for service, and of the private plantations erected could be given. Even a partial financial account could be rendered, though not an itemized statement. The larger sums invested or received from the various sources are usually given in the treasurer\u2019s plans and the officers\u2019 reports, although unfortunately only those of the treasurer and deputy are entered in full. But from scattered statements in plans, reports, and discussions, from grants, patents, suits, letters, petitions, and claims will come much that will illuminate the financial situation when these are gathered together.  The full record of all documents for which record was not provided elsewhere was made in the court book. Plans, reports of committees, and reports of chief officers seem to have been entered in full, but letters to and from the colony, and to and from the privy council, petitions with the action thereupon, charter parties, grants for monopolies, lists of departing planters, expenditures and receipts of the magazines, and rolls of adventure, were all recorded in the other books provided by the \u2018* Orders and Constitutions\u201d or in the books created later. A single illustration will suffice. Of the twenty-seven letters sent to the colony and received from the colony, copies of many of which have been found among the papers in Virginia, but fifteen are mentioned in the court book, and only a few are spread in full upon the minutes. A great many more documents are entered in the court book during the later years, due evidently to the desire to keep a record of the controversy which might serve as a defense against the accusations of the malcontents. That many of these were not entered in the original court book is revealed by the marginal notes in the extant court minutes of the Ferrar papers, which read as follows: \u2018\u2018 Enter the quietus est,\u201d \u2018\u2018Enter the resolution,\u201d and other similar directions.  The court book is not only a source of information, but it also serves as a guide to the other records of the company. That all of the twenty-one documents men- tioned but not entered in the court book have been found in other collections is most important and interesting. These include some of the publications of the company, most of the correspondence of the company with the King and with the  @The terms in general are given in the Presidents for Patents in the British Museum.

There are thirteen documents entered in the court book which are on record elsewhere, consisting of declarations or reports which were published by the company, petitions and letters to the King, and orders of the \u201c King\u2019s council. But thirty most valuable documents are spread upon the minutes which have not yet been discovered among other papers. These include a few peti- tions to the King, many petitions received by the company, a number of letters from and to the colony, the propositions brought forward in the attempt to form a tobacco contract with the King, the plans propounded by the treasurer for the advancement of the enterprise, and the declarations of the state of the affairs of the company and of the colony by the same officer. \u00a2  THE EXTANT SUPPLEMENTARY RECORDS DOCUMENTS OUTLINING THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY  The organization and the method of procedure of the company have been outlined, in order to enable the reader to comprehend the nature of the records, and through them the machinery by which it conducted its internal affairs; but there is a wider and more important field to consider. The real interest in the company comes from its activity in carrying on trade and in developing the resources and government of the colony. Again, the starting point must be the court hook, not only as a guide to the records which it kept in executing its purposes, but in discovering what activities are to be traced. Two kinds of documents afford the clearest outline of the subject; in one are the reports which the treasurer offered to the company and which are spread upon the minutes; in the other are the printed declarations and broadsides which the company issued for the purpose of securing interest, confidence, and investment in the undertaking. With the same motive it reprinted treatises and published sermons which had been delivered before the company.  The first report of Sir Edwin Sandys after he became treasurer was offered on November 3, 1619, in which he thus defined his policy: The resources of the company were to be augmented by settling and developing the company\u2019s land and by increasing the number of industries to be established, an action which must advance the plantation from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement. The report begins with a statement of the number of men which had been transported  @ All of these documents, whether entered in the court book or not, are cited in the List o: Records, and are also referred to by foot notes in this edition of the court book.

The other measures discussed are indicative of the development which rapidly took place. First of these was the effort to establish other commodities in Virginia and restrain the excessive production of tobacco; the second was the encouragement of a spirit of local patriotism in the colony. The treasurer urges that men should be sent from the low countries to raise fortifications for the colony, stating that the colonists were willing to bear the charges of the work since they had recently been encouraged by the charters and grants of liberties. The dependence of the company upon the lotteries for an income and the care to arrange for an economical transportation of the men are indications of the financial policy and status of the colony. The income of the lottery is estimated at \u00a33,500, and the total expense of perfecting the plan submitted is placed at \u00a34,000 or \u00a35,000.  Six months later the treasurer made his annual report, which revealed to what extent his plans had been executed. It was issued as a broadside under the date of the court in which it was delivered and describes the state of the colony from April, 1618, to April, 1619, taken from a general letter to the company, and then proceeds to outline the successful activity of the colony during the succeeding year. It empha- sizes the erection of private plantations, the number of men sent to the company\u2019s land, the commodities provided for\u2014there being ten instead of two as in the former year-\u2014the interest in the care of religion and education in the colony, and the stable financial condition of the company. The general receipts amounted to \u00a39,831 14s 11d and the disbursements were \u00a310,431 14s U7d, but the surplus in the college fund more than exceeded this deficiency, the receipts from that source being \u00a32,043 02s 114d and the expenditures \u00a31,477 15s 5d. The lottery was reported to have an increase in stock over the previous year of \u00a31,200. Although not re-elected treasurer, the financial management remained in the hands of Sir Edwin Sandys, as is proved by the entries of his plans in the court book and by his private letters to John Ferrar. A scheme outlined in the court of July 7, 1620, is practically the measure put forth in the printed declaration of June 22, 1620, and proposes a continuation of the policy stated above.  The printed documents of 1619 and 1620 add but little to the plans revealed in the treasurer\u2019s reports concerning the activity of the company, although the measures taken to advance the comfort of the planters and of the tenants upon arrival in Virginia, the establishment of many private plantations, and the encouragement given to the self-government of the colony are brought out more clearly. After the note of the shipping in 1621, so far as is known, there were no propositions issued ",
    "299": "UNDER THE SANDYS-SOUTHAUPTON ADMINISTRATION 89  by the company. This was due to the massacre which paralyzed the efforts of the company for a time and forced upon it publications of defense and excuse or directions of warning. While the company was torn by dissension, after 1622 the colony slowly but steadily advanced. The proprietor was no longer active, and the center of interest is therefore transferred from the courts in London in which the plans had been conceived to the settlenient in which they were maturing.  The various publications of the company afford not only an understanding of the measures proposed, but also of their execution. They were in themselves a means of carrying out its schemes. Before 1622 five of these advertisements were issued by the company. The broadside hearing the date May 17, 1620, is a full statement of the prosperous condition in the colony, setting forth the ability of the colony to receive newcomers in its guest houses, newly built in each of the four ancient boroughs and in the other plantations, and describing the measures provided to sus- tain ministers in cach borough. It states the number of men who had been sent to the public land, with the provisions allowed, and describes fully the efforts which had been made to establish six industries in the colony.\u00a2  A book of great importance was issued by the company in June of the same year containing a series of declarations.\u2019 There were at least two editions in the year 1620, having variations in the title page; in the first edition the pages are numbered according to each pamphlet and the imprint is \u2018*T. S.,\u201d while in the second the pagination is consecutive from 1 to 92 and the imprint is that of Thomas Snodham. The latter varies also in the orthography of the word \u2018\u2018colony\u2122 in the title. The former was probably the first edition and was composed of pamphlets, each of which may have been issued separately, and seems to have been reissued, with an additional pamphlet concerning a division of land in Virginia,\u201c in which the signature is consecutive. Copies of the first issue of the first edition of the ** Decla- rations\u201d are in the Harvard Library and in the New York Public Library (*' No. 1\u201d), but the only copy of the second issue is in the John Carter Brown Library (copy \u2018tA\u201d). The copies in the British Museum, the Cambridge University Library,@ the Library of Congress, the John Carter Brown Library (copy *B\u201d), and the New York Public Library (Thomas Addison Emmet Collection, \u2018No. 2\") are identical and are evidently the first issue of the second edition.

(2) A publication which should confute the slander as to the barrenness of the soil in Virginia, ordered November 22.  (3) A list of the names of adventurers with the sums adventured, ordered to be drawn up by the treasurer and Dr. Winstone, December 15.\u00b0  (4) An apology for Virginia, ordered to be printed June 28, 1620. On June 26 and 28 it was provided that the standing orders should be printed and annexed to the book to be given to all members by order of the council.  The conclusion seems valid that these pamphlets are the ones included in the book and that they first appeared at various times, but that finally in June, 1620, they were collected, the fourth one added, and the volume published under the date of the latter.  The publication of this declaration in four different issues during the year 1620 indicates the interest which Sir Edwin Sandys had aroused in the measure, as well as  \u00abThis is copy No. 3 in the New York Public Library.

In order to promote the silk industry a pamphlet entitled \u2018\u2018 Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk wormes,\u201d written by Banoeil, was translated under the patronage of the company toward the end of the year 1620.\u00a2 It contains a pamphlet called \u2018A Valuation of the Commodities growing and to be had in Virginia: rated as they are worth,\u201d in which is presented the astonishing list of 49 articles. The natural commodities which did not require especial cultivation, such as various kinds of tish, furs, woods, shrubs and berries, were of course included. But this proof of rapid development in the industrial habits and occupations of the colonists is most important, and the note of the shipping of the same year and the one in 1621 are confirmatory. In the former is the statement of the number of men sent for each of four industries, and in the latter a similar declaration. The rapid transportation of settlers and the development of private plantations in these two years is as sur- prising. Thus in 1620 six ships with 600 persons were sent to the colony, and 4U0 more settlers were to be sent at once, of whom 500 were destined for the com- pany\u2019s land. The next year the number of ships dispatched increased to twenty-one and the number of persons to 1,300, while the number of patents for private plantations grew from six to twenty-six.  During the year 1622 the books printed by the company were much less valuable, although more numerous, there being seven in all. Zhe Declaration of the state of the Colony of Virginia with the Relation of the Massacre of the English, by the Native Infidells with the names of those that were Massacred, by Edward Waterhouse, was more concerned with the disaster than with the previous development of the plantation.\u2019 A broadside is inserted in the copy of this declaration in the John Carter Brown Library, entitled \u2018\u2018 Virginia Inconveniences,\u201d\u00b0 which was published separately and was a set of directions with regard to the provisions which each person should have before sailing for the colony. This included apparel, victuals, household implements, arms, sugar, spice, and fruit for consumption at sea, and nets, hooks, lines, and a tent for large numbers. The declaration was made that for its own tenants the Virginia Company followed the proportionate provision as set forth in this broadside. It is at once an advertisement for new tenants and a warning against the dangers which had wrought dissatisfaction and brought complaints to the com- pany.

Thus the proposition by Smith to write a history of Vir- ginia on April 12, 1621, seems to have been acceptable to the adventurers, while George Rugh, who had rendered service to the Virginia council hy writing a treatise on government, was publicly eulogized upon his bequeathing \u00a3100 to the company for the education of infidels\u2019 children.\u00a2 Edward Bennett was admitted to the com- pany as a reward for a treatise against the importation of tobacco from Spain, and the chronicler, Howes, was granted 12 pounds of tobacco as a yearly payment for his references to Virginia.\u00b0  A number of works were suggested in the courts of which we have no trace or which can not be identified as appearing under other titles.

In 1621 three other proposed publications failed to be executed, so far as is known, the tirst of which was a treatise on the government of Virginia by Thomas Bargrave.?

DOCUMENTS REVEALING THE MOVEMENTS FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY  The printed advertisements between 1619 and 1621 were successful in securing the capital with which to carry on the enterprise. It now remains to discover how the trade was conducted and controlled, how the plantation was developed and governed, and how the business was finally destroyed.  The income which enabled the company to provide for new industries in 1619 and 1620 was derived from the \u00a312 10s. paid by each new adventurer for each new share of stock, and from the lotteries. Special collections and particular gifts for the advancement of religion and of education in the colony were frequent, and thus the account and management of the college land became important. Before the intro- duction of freedom of trade into the colony, and the dissolution of the old magazine on January 12, 1619, 20, the company had some profit from that monopoly,\u2019 but the ease with which returns came from the lotteries had doubtless led the company to abolish the monopoly of trade which had become so difficult to maintain. That the company depended on the lotteries is indicated by the following statements in the court book: On December 1, 1619, the lotteries were continued until summer because there was no other means of securing money, and the plan put forth for the devel- opment of the colony on July 7, 1620, provided that the estimated expense of \u00a317,800 should be met by the income from the lotteries, which would amount to \u00a318,000. Information concerning the organization for conducting the lottery is wanting. Books and rolls and catalogues of prizes are referred to but have not been found.\u00a2 Thus the only documents which throw light on the system outside of the court book are the records of the suit of the Virginia Company against William Leveson, an agent for the lottery in 1613, which discloses that books and rolls had been kept. and that a house for the lottery had been erected and furnished \u2018\u2018at the west end of St. Paules Church;\u201d a proclamation by the King for the overthrow of the lottery on March 8, 1620/21; and a few letters solicting investments.\u00b0  The investments by the company during the period of the lotteries followed three lines\u2014the old magazine, the planting of the public and the college lands in  @ Court Book, I, April 12, June 11, 13, 1621.  b Ibid., I, November 19, 21, 1621; March 13, 1621/22. \u00a2 Ibid., 1, July 7, 1619.  @Jhid., 1, June 24, 1619; January 12, 1619/20.  \u00a2 List of Records, Nos, 28, 29, 71, 78.

    "304": "94 INTRODUCTION  Virginia, and the erection of industries for the production of certain commodities, The court book is the only source of information with regard to the old magazine, in which the company through its general stock of the company had invested more than twice as much as any other adventurer. Hence, during the last half of the year 1619, it made every effort to gain an account and secure a settlement of that adventure. The discussion, which resulted in the adoption of free trade to the colony, reveals the system used for the control of the magazine, indicates to a slight degree the income which the company had had from that joint stock, and incidentally shows that it had some returns from the public lands in Virginia.\u00a2 The numbers of men sent to the company\u2019s land and their equipment are given in the printed declarations, in the reports of the treasurer spread on the minutes, and in the discussions recorded in the court book, and although the sums invested for the purpose are not recorded, the statement was made by Sir Edwin Sandys that 800 men were sent through the income from the lottery. The transportation of dissolute persons in the year 1619 to meet the command of the King, and the settlement of boys and girls on the company\u2019s land previous to 1622, were other means used to people the public and college lands.?  Five commodities enumerated in the broadside of May 17, 1620, were established by action of the court. No record is extant of the exact nature of the investment, but it appears from the court book to have been chiefly an investment from the general stock. The movement for monopoly of certain industries rather than a monopoly of all trade began during the latter part of the year 1620, and as a result the records deal extensively with plans for the sole importation of tobacco, by which a joint stock of \u00a315,000 was to be raised to carry out what is known as the \u2018* Somerscales plan.\u201d  The overthrow of the lotteries carried consternation to the company. An income was essential with which to send out settlers to develop the soil or to create new industries, but the general stock was so low that the company could not even carry out its plans for glassworks. Finally, after several months of discussion, recourse was had to special adventure or new joint stock companies for special undertakings, controlled by a treasurer who should be elected by the adventurers in the scheme. Thus followed the creation of a series of magazines for the erection of a glass furnace, for the establishment of a fur trade, for sending maids for wives, and for supplying a magazine for apparel. The records of these ventures are to he found only in the court book, and the data there given is very insufficient. This, of course, meant no advantage to the general stock, and the company was forced to discover means for securing returns from the general investment and an income with  @ Court Book, 1, June 24, 28, July 7, 18, November 3, December 15, 1619. b Iuid., December 23, 1619; January 12, February 2, 1619/20; July 3, 1622.

Hence, private plantations were organized, and private patents and monopolies for the industry of pitch and tar, for ironworks, for new discoveries were granted, while special commissions for trade along the coast and for fishing added to the revenue. With the exception of the movement for private plantations and for the sole importation of tobacco, but few records exist outside of the court book to reveal these vigorous endeavors to reap the results of the great investments in the earlier years.\u00a2 The grants for private plantations to individuals or groups of individuals, called hundreds, commenced as early as 1616, but increased rapidly during and after 1621, there being entries in the court book of over fifty patents granted in four years, which provide for the transportation of at least 100 men each and often for four times as many. The system by which each hundred in Virginia and the adventurers for the hundred in England was organized is to be found in the court book and in the extant records of the companies. The minutes of one meeting for Martin\u2019s Hundred and one for Smythe\u2019s Hundred, and the forms for patents deposited in the British Museum, in addition to about seventy papers of Berkeley Hundred, afford a very satisfactory reconstruction of the terms of agreement, the expenses, the provisioning, the form of government, the instructions issued to the captain or governor of the hundred, and the terms of settlement with tenants and servants. The adventures of Lord Zouch and Lord La Warr in 1617 and 1618, and of the Walloons and French in 1621, complete the series of which any record exists.?  But the private grants did not promise sufficient income to meet the great demands for supplies from the general stock which the massacre of 1622 brought about. As a result the company turned to the income from tobacco, regardless of its high purposes and its endeavors to enforce the production of other com- modities. This feeling of the importance of a contract for the sole importation of tobacco took such a strong hold upon the company that from May, 1622, until its dissolution, Just a year later, nothing else worth mentioning is recorded in th\u00e9 court book, while the quarrel concerning the salaries to be paid for the manage- ment of the \u00a3100,000 to be invested in this project monopolized the attention of several courts.

The communications with the Privy Council on the subject are spread on the company\u2019s minutes, and are also to be found among the Colonial State papers. This series includes the proclamations of the King in 1624, and the new propositions and measures for tobacco importation of the same year. The economic condition of the planter, the necessity of a revenue to the company, the amount of the importation and of the customs value to the King, the relations with Spain, and the economic values in England are all brought out in the estimates, discussions, and arguments.*  DOCUMENTS DISCLOSING THE RELATIONS WITH THE COLONY  The study of the relations of the company to the colony and the development within the colony may be based on a greater variety of documents than any other phase of the subject, especially with regard to the political conditions. The court book furnishes an understanding of the attitude and motives of the company and often serves to connect the data gathered from letters, instructions, commissions, patents, and grants. Thus the emphasis on the custom of martial law in the colony and the severity of penalty imposed is revealed both in the court book and in the extracts from Governor Argall\u2019s register.? The additional forms of government required by the development of the colony are recorded in the court book, by which the company created the offices of deputies to the governor for the college and for the public land, secretary, treasurer, chancellor, and surveyor, and provided for the compensation of officers by grants of land, by transportation of tenants, by the income of the company\u2019s land, and by allowance of fees.\u00a9 The requests for the appointment of a council of State and for laws and orders, urgently repeated by Governor Yeardley, as recorded in the court book in 1619, give evidence that the source of such development was in the colony. But the fundamental law for the government of the colony is recorded in three documents, the instructions to Goy- ernor Yeardley, November 8, 1618, which created the land system, the instructions to Governor Wyatt, July 24, 1621, which emphasized the industrial development, and \u2018* An Ordinance and Constitution * * * fora Councill of State and Generall Assembly\u201d in Virginia, which confirmed the political forms.

The approval of a quarter court of the company, which was necessary for legalizing the acts of the assembly, is referred to in the court book in three places only.\u201d The constitution and the provisions for division of the country into cities and boroughs, recorded both in the instructions and in the patents by which the government of the private plantations was delegated to a private body, form the basis for a study of the local systems. The records of Smythe\u2019s, Martin\u2019s, and Berkeley Hundred referred to above, the correspondence of Samuel Argall with Bermuda Hundred, and the commissions for government issued by Governor Argall and later by the council of state complete the sources on this subject. The precedents for patents are valuable in the information which they afford with regard to the position of the following classes of colonists: The old adventurer not subject to rent; the adventurer paying money for his shares and agreeing to transport 100 persons; the adventurer settling a private plantation; the individual planter.\u2019 These documents also throw light on the liberty of the individual, his exemption from taxation without his consent by the colony or by the private plantation, and his submission to a government almost military in character.  The strict supervision which the company exercised over the economic, indus- trial, and social conditions of the colony is to be seen in the measures enacted in the courts and in the correspondence between the company and the colony, sup- plemented by a large number of private letters to the officers of the company. Four letters to the colony are mentioned in the court book, of which two have not been found, but eight others not mentioned are extant. It is more difficult to determine what letters came from the colony, due to the usually brief reports of the letters in the court book, to the omission of the date from the copies of the letters, and from the uncertainty of the date of the receipt of the letters as noted in the court book. Seven letters seem to have been received by the company of which no trace has been found, while only four of the ten extant are mentioned in the court book. It is apparent therefore that only a part of the official corre- spondence is in existence. The directions to the colony disclose the care and earnestness of the company, and emphasize the endeavors to establish the various commodities, while the descriptions given by the colonists are extremely valuable in the picture they present of their efforts, ambitions, and attainments.

    "308": "98 INTRODUCTION  vate correspondence proves that the official letters were likely to give but one phase of the conditions.  About thirty-five letters addressed to Sir Edwin Sandys during the years 1619 to 1621 have been found among the Ferrar papers, which are full of complaint because of the scarcity of provisions. Apparently Sir Edwin\u2019s policy to develop the plantation, and especially the company\u2019s land as a source of revenue, was overdone, and he was not as wise in carrying out his plan as he had been in forming it, since the colony was unable to provide for the large numbers sent out. These complaints are casually mentioned in the court book, but the Sandys-Ferrar correspondence shows that it was the desire of the administration to conceal the difficulties and distress of the colony not only from the public but also from the hostile faction. The Man- chester papers preserve letters, or copies of them, which came to the company or to individuals in 1622 and 1623 complaining of similar deprivations in the colony.4  The company was not only interested in the economic and industrial develop- ment and the necessary political forms of the colony, but, as Sir Edwin Sandys declared, it had a higher purpose than the Muscovy or the other commercial corpo- rations. This high ideal is proved by the attention which is devoted to plans for the college, by the appointment of ministers, by the collections in the churches, and by the gifts received,\u2019 but the theory that the chief motive of the enterprise was religious is not supported either by the spirit or by the data of the records.  RECORDS KEPT BY THE OFFICERS IN THE COLONY  The acts of the administration in Virginia are recorded in the volume of contemporary records of the company kept by the colony which are described above. They consist of a series of nine orders and proclamations by the governor and council and of twenty-one orders, proclamations, commissions, and warrants issued by the governor as the executive officer of the council for the regulation of affairs in the colony. They cover the years 1621, 1622, and 1623, and concern the collection of taxes, the designation of laborers for public works, the regu- lation of prices of commodities, the restraint of relations with the Indians, and the control of the morals of the citizens. In addition to these documents issued by the governor is a series of twenty-four commissions and warrants issued to individuals to act as commanders of cities and hundreds, to carry on trade with the Indians, to make discoveries, to wage war upon the Indians, and to collect moneys. Another group of documents in the same collection consists of thirty- six petitions to the governor and council between 1622 and 1624. They are  6For a citation of these letters in the List of Records, see the Index under \u201c\u2018 Letters.\u2019\u2019 b Post, Vol. II, Index under \u2018 College,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018 Education,\u2019\u201d\u2019 \u2018\u2018 Ministers.\u201d\u2019 ",

The only extant record of the council for 1619 is an account of the \u2018putting out of the Tenants that came over in the B[ona] N[ova] w other orders of the Councell,\u201d found among the Ferrar papers.?  The \u2018\u2018courte booke,\u201d or original record of the meetings of the governor and council, in which these petitions were heard and orders issued, is extant from 1624 to 1632, with a record of one court in 1622 and of one in 1623. These are mostly the actions of the council sitting in a judicial capacity and concern controversies over property, probate matters, and criminal charges. The punishments seem extreme. Two actions of the court are particularly interesting, one affecting Edward Sharpless for sending copies of the colonial records to England, and the other consisting of accusations against Captain John Martin of slanderous and false utterances. A few additional orders and warrants are preserved among the Colonial State papers,\u00b0 together with a report of the proceedings of the assembly in 1619, written by John Pory and sent to England, the only other account of which was sent to Sir Edwin Sandys by John Rolfe, and is among the Ferrar papers.\u201c The acts of the assembly for March 5, 1623/24 are the only measures of that body during the life of the company which are extant, with the exception of the letters and petitions addressed to the company and to the King, and of a few orders.  DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTIONS AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMPANY  A series of documents remains which does not bear directly on the organization of the company or the expression of its activity in trade and in colonial enterprise, but is invaluable for a study of the history of the company, since it concerns the relations of the individual members to one another, reveals the inner life and motive of the company as a whole and of the various groups, and explains the conditions which resulted from the interference of the King and the overthrow of the corpora- tion. The entire movement centers about the growth of factions in the company. The movement begins in the years just preceding the accession of Sir Edwin Sandys to the position of treasurer, and seems to have had its origin in the trouble over  @\u00a5or citation of these documents in the List of Records, see the Index under \u2018\u2018 Warrants,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Commissions,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018 Proclamations,\u2019 \u2018Orders.\u2019  b List of Records, Nos. 138, 139.  \u00a2 Ibid., Nos. 240, 521, 645. dIbid., Nos. 116, 154.

It finally involved many of the personal complaints and difficulties which presented themselves to the company, and therefore requires a study of those problems before it can be understood.  The measures which thus arose with regard to individuals are to be found chiefly in the court book. They supply much information which can not be obtained elsewhere with regard to the methods of procedure of the company, and afford scattered data of great importance in addition to the light they throw on the disputes of the factions. The subjects discussed include such problems as the relations with the northern colony, the conflict with Spain concerning the ship Zreasurer, the suit against William Wye for failing to land settlers in Vir- ginia, and various accusations against Governor Yeardley and Captain Argall for misgovernment in the colony. The accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe, the settle- ment of Alderman Robert Johnson\u2019s accounts for the magazine, and the illegality of Captain John Martin\u2019s patent for a plantation, were also questions which were of vital importance to the financial affairs of the company and took the atten- tion of numerous courts; but neither the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe nor of the magazine were ever adjusted.  The claims against the company presented by William Tracey, by William Welden, the deputy of the college land who was superseded by George Thorpe, and by the heirs of Sir George Somers for a compensation for the Somers Islands are but illustrations of the many demands made upon the company. The court sat as a judiciary body to settle numerous personal quarrels, including the Brewster-Argall, the Argall-Smythe, the Bargrave-Smythe, and the Johnson- Southampton cases. Disputes which arose within the courts and resulted in slander and counter aceusations took much of the time and attention of the company, the trouble between the council and Samuel Wroth over the question of salaries thus consuming the entire time of the courts for three months, from December to February, 1622/3. In the various collections in London are about a dozen papers which give additional information on the Argall-Rich troubles, the censure of Alderman Johnson, the Martin patent, the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe, and the suits against William Wye.\u00a2  The documents which bear directly on the factional differences in the company are among the Manchester and the Ferrar papers.

When the quarrels had finally been carried to the Privy Council, the matter was taken up officially by the company, and the second volume of the court book after the spring of 1623 is composed entirely of documents spread upon the minutes which concern the action of the company. In fact, all of the papers after that time are of the same character except the records of the governor and council in Virginia. Since they number upward of two hundred, it will be impossible to discuss them separately, but it must be remembered that in them is to be found an outline of the history of the company reaching back into the time of Sir Thomas Smythe, presented first by one faction and then by the other. The most important of these reviews are the charges of Captain Butler, of Alderman Johnson, and of Captain Bargrave, with replies to each; the complaints of the adventurers and of the planters against the Sandys administration, and a declaration by the \u2018\u2018 ancient planters\u201d comparing the two administrations in the colony. Finally, the \u2018\u2018 Discourse of the Old Company \u201d is the last review of the whole situation. Another most important group of papers is a series of projects for readjusting the government of the colony and the adminis- tration of the company. The projects of Martin, Bargrave, Ditchtield, and Rich thus afford an opportunity to study the beginnings of royal control.  The relations between the Crown and the company assume three different phases during the Sandys-Southampton administration\u2014the first before the dis- cussion over the tobacco contract in 1622, the second concerning that contract, and the third relating to the abuses in the company and the dissolution of the corpora- tion. The court book shows a readiness and a desire on the part of the company before 1622 to refer to the Privy Council such matters as the magazine accounts which seemed beyond their control, but it also contains declarations to the effect that an interference with the patent rights is not to be tolerated. The questions arising in those years concern the transportation of dissolute persons to the col- ony, the right of the King to nominate men from whom the treasurer should be chosen, the restriction on trade to other countries, the refusal of a new charter to the company, and the dissolution of the lotteries. Supplementary to these records in the court book are the orders of the Privy Council affecting all of these  4Citation of these documents in the List of Records may be found by reference to the Index  under the Sandys-Ferrar letters, the Rich and Johnson memoranda, and the letters in the Man- chester papers.

It was first proposed November 15, 1620, and was ordered to be continued and to be confirmed by Parliament on January 31, 1620/21. On the 22d of the following month the Lords were appointed to secure the seal, and on April 12 the objections of the attorney-general, to whom the King had referred the patent, were discussed. That it never went into effect is certain, since no record is to be found among the sign manual warrants in the record office or in the signet docquet book. Furthermore, it is not enrolled in the chancery files, and it is not entered on the patent rolls, while in the suit of the guo warranto the only letters patent cited are those already known of 1606, 1609, and 1612.\u00b0  Unless the documents have been lost or the date of the entry has been mis- taken the conclusion must be reached that after the surrender of the draft of the new charter to the solicitor-general it disappeared from sight. During the year 1622 the communications between the King and the company concerned the tobacco con- tract and its final acceptance at the command of the King, and revealed the maturity of the policy of interference which had been developing during the previous years. The number of accusations against the company increased during the year, and the records of the early part of 1623 abound in letters of complaint and charges of mismanagement from the colony. The memoranda of the Warwick party, found among the Manchester papers, are also essential to the understanding of the movements toward the overthrow of the company. Many of the forty communi- cations between the King and the company are spread on the court book, while all of them are found in the Privy Council register.

The correspondence between the King and the colony during those months of struggle concerned the latter commission and established the royal authority, but the letters from the colony were addressed to the company as late as the close of the year, six months after the judgment was rendered in the guo warranto suit.  The record of this suit is found in the coram rege roll of the Kings Bench. In the entry the usual writ served upon the company is followed by the information read by Edward Offley, the attorney for the company, citing the letters patent of 1606 and especially of 1609. It enumerates the rights granted to the corporation, and claims that other privileges were never used. The third document is the reply of Attorney-General Coventry in which he prays for the conviction of the accused on account of the usurpation of privileges, and cites those mentioned in the infor- mation, claiming that there had not been sufficient answer in any point. The answer of Nicholas Ferrar and others states that the company is ready to verify its rights as quoted. The judgment was rendered on the morrow of Holy Trinity, and declares that Nicholas Ferrar and the others are convicted of the usurpation of privileges and that the \u2018\u2018said privileges are taken and seized into the hand of the King and the said Nicholas Ferrar and others shall not intermeddle but shall be excluded from the usurpation of liberties, privileges, and franchises of the same so taken from the King, and that they are to satisfy to the King his fine for the usurpa- tion of said privileges.\u201d The writ of guo warranto was issued out of the Kings Bench on the Tuesday next after the morrow of All Souls (November 4, 1623). The suit was opened on the Friday after the quindecim of St. Martin\u2019s (November 28), and was then postponed until the eighth of Hillary (January 20). It was postponed a second time to the quindecim of Easter (April 11), and judgment was finally rendered on the morrow of Trinity (May 24, 1624).  VALUE OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS  It has been the purpose of this paper to give to the reader a knowledge of what records the Virginia Company kept and to afford a guide to the extant records, as well as to indicate the character and importance of the various col- lections of records and of the various classes of documents. The value of this series of papers is threefold\u2014it discloses the organization and activity of the company; it aids in an understanding of the various problems, policies, and con- ditions of the State under the early Stuarts; and it is of great importance in a study of the entire movement of the earlier and of the later century for exploration, for trade, and especially for colonization. ",
    "314": "104 INTRODUCTION  The object of the previous discussion has been to show that an intimate knowledge of the mechanism of the company, of the methods of other corporations and business houses, of the policies of the company toward the plantation, of the growth of the colony, and of the change in the attitude of the Crown may be gained from the various documents. Thus the value of the records in revealing the methods employed by the company in conducting its courts, in keeping its books, in securing capital, and in finding investment which would result in immediate returns and enable the com- pany to transport men to the colony, has been pointed out. The evidence of the change of the plantation from a colony for exploitation to a colony for settlement, and the consequent effort of the company to stimulate exploration, settlement, and the development of resources, as well as the proof of the liberality of the proprietors in advancing self-government, has been outlined.  The indication in the records of the colony that the control changed from absolute authority centralized in the governor to local management and government through a representative legislative assembly, and that the social conditions developed from life in a few compact settlements to plantation life has been suggested. Moreover, the documents which show the efforts of the joint-stock companies to gain protection and become privileged monopolies, on the one hand, and the tendency of the Crown, on the other, to utilize the company to relieve the country of its undesirable popu- lation, to secure a share in the revenue, and finally to assume the full proprietorship of the colony has been cited.  The court book and other records of the company have another value in that they incidentally aid in an understanding of many problems of the government. Thus the attitude of the King toward the company was much influenced by his desire for marriage relations with Spanish royalty. Various questions of policy were often discussed in the meetings of the company, such as the freedom of trade and of fishing, monopolies, customs, and shipping, while the financial aid given to colo- nization by Spain is cited in contrast to the action of England, and the favor to the Spanish colonies by the State in allowing the sole importation of certain products was dwelt upon. The desire to cement the colony to the State and the necessity of avoiding separation was much emphasized, but the wisdom of allowing self-government to the colony was never once forgotten. In fact, the argument that democracy was unavoidable, since the planter had the privilege of the adventurer, was urged in opposition to the accusations of the King that the company favored democratic forms. This spirit in the company is also seen in the tendency to address Parliament whenever possible, us illustrated in the movement for a new patent and in the settlement of the tobacco question.  The economic and industrial situation in England is perhaps better revealed than any other phase of affairs. Thus the commodities which were in demand and not ",
    "315": "UNDER THE SANDYS-SOUTHAMPTON ADMINISTRATION 105  produced in England, the rates of such commodities, the prices of necessities, and the system of vending goods were all matters of great importance to the company, and appear again and again in the various documents. The poverty of skilled labor is shown in the necessity the company was under to go to the Continent for men to superintend and carry on every industry which it attempted to establish in the col- ony. Dutchmen, Swedes, Poles, and Frenchmen were thus imported for conducting sawmills, cultivating silkworms, and making potash, clapboards, salt, wines, and glass. When engineers for constructing fortifications were desired, General Cecil declared that he had not men for the purpose, but hoped he might be able to recom- mend some Frenchmen of ability. The papers which concern the transportation of vagabonds and of boys and girls furnish a comment on a special phase of social life, while the spirit of the entire records reveals the demand for an outlet for activity and an opportunity for investment.  Throughout, the minutes of the courts and the correspondence and references to the other trading companies emphasize the strong similarity between their organization and that of the Virginia corporation. Illustrations of this fact are seen in the citation of the precedent from other joint-stock companies of employing a deputy and a director, of the salaries paid in the Kast India Company, and of the liberty of trade enjoyed by the Muscovy Company; while among the Ferrar papers are drafts of petitions from the Commons to the King in the writing of Nicholas Ferrar on behalf of the Turkey merchants and of the \u2018\u2018Ginny and Binny\u201d company, showing the intimate relations between the different movements.  Perhaps the most important result of a study of the Virginia Company comes from the knowledge which may be gained of the whole movement which had as its object exploration, trade, and settlement before and since the time of the company in all of the colonies. In its records are to be found one of the earliest sources of information concerning colonial experience from the English standpoint, and bence through them may be gained an understanding of the way in which proprietary colonies were established; of the development of the plantation into a colony of settlement; and of the consequent relation between the settlers and the proprietor. These steps as well as those by which the Crown was led to resume the authority and to establish a royal proprietorship in place of that of a company or of an indivi- dual, and the consequent development of the freedom of the settler were repeated in the history of all of the proprietary colonies of America, ",

Che Hate of the Orininal Records\u201d  It was in July, 1622, that the controversy between the factions in the company was first brought before the Privy Council, and, strangely enough, the plaintiff was Jobn Bargrave, who later championed those whom he now accused. The complain- ant declared that he had lost 6,600 pounds through the \u2018unjust practices and miscarriage of government\u201d on the part of Sir Thomas Smythe and Alderman Robert Johnson. The matter was referred to a committee composed of Lord Viscount Grandison, Lord Brook, the master of the rolls, Lord Keeper Coventry, and Secretary Conway, but the affair dragged on in the council until it was finally settled on January 22, 1622/3, by its ordering Bargrave to forbear troubling Sir Thomas Smythe.\u2019? From that time the battle between the factions in the company had begun. The tobacco contract between the lord treasurer as representative of the King on the one hund and the company on the other, which had occupied so much of the time of the courts, was allowed by the Privy Council on the 2d of February.\u00b0 But the spirit of conflict was seen in the entire correspondence, and during the few succeeding months bitter complaints concerning the mismanagement of affairs in the colony were made by Nathaniel Butler in his Unmasking of the Colony of Virginia and by Alderman Johnson in his Declaration.t That both of these originated in the Warwick faction has been revealed by the Manchester papers.  On April 17 a committee headed by Lord Cavendish was summoned before the Privy Council to defend the Virginia Company against the \u2018grievances of Planters and Adventurers.\u201d As a result, the first blow was struck at the liberty  @That the Virginia Company had a large number of records which are not now extant hag been revealed by a study of the existing documents. In addition to the original court books and the five other records provided for by the \u2018\u2018Orders and Constitutions\u2019\u2019 there were the books created at a later date, the duplicates of patents and grants, the petitions, and all of the account books of the various magazines and joint stock companies. If the papers of the private plantations and hundreds which are represented by the Smyth of Nibley papers, were added to these, the volume of missing records would become very great. A discussion therefore of what resources have been searched, though in vain, seems desirable, in order to aid further investigation.  6 List of Records, Nos, 351,401.  \u00a2 Ibid., No. 401.  @ Thid., Nos. 388, 395.  107 ",

From that time the affairs of the company were under surveillance, and the correspondence, the trade, and even the personal liberty of its officers were subject to restraint. The company was immediately forbidden to receive any private letters except on its own business, while on the 28th of the same month its letters were disallowed by the Privy Council because they failed to \u2018\u2018certify the King\u2019s grace to the Colonies.\u201d Already the court books and other writings had been required of the secretary of the company, as is shown by a receipt for the same, dated April 21, among the Ferrar papers. This receipt was given to Edward Collingwood by the clerk of the council. As a concomitant the council dissolved the tobacco contract and reduced the former customs on tobacco from twelve to nine pence per pound. It allowed the companies the sole importation of tobacco, but it required that the whole crop should be brought into England.?  There were other acts which partook of the same spirit as the interference with the correspondence and business of the company. On May 13 the Privy Council ordered that Lord Cavendish, Sir Edwin Sandys, and Nicholas and John Ferrar should be confined to their houses, a punishment inflicted for a contempt of an order of the council table against the use of bitter invectives, and brought about by the complaint of the Earl of Warwick. Lord Cavendish was in restraint five days and the others eight days. The release came as a result of their **acknowledgment of offence and expression of sorrow.\u201d\u00b0 The threat of the King was carried out, and the declaration of war was made on May 9 by the appointment of a commission to investigate the disputes in the Virginia Company and to report upon their method of procedure.  The danger of contiscation of the company\u2019s records was fully realized for the the first time on May 22, 1623, when the Privy Council enforced a previous order to surrender \u2018\u2018 all Charters Books, (and by name the blurred Book or Books), Letters, Petitions, Lists of Names and Provisions, Invoyces of Goods, and all other writing whatsoever, and Transcripts of them, belonging to them.\u201d The new order declared that the \u2018\u2018 Blurred Book or Books\u201d had been kept back. \u2018The documents were to be surrendered to the clerk of the council, but the custody of the records was given to the commissioners. Each party was to have free use of them \u2018\u2018in such sort as to ye Commissioners shall seem good.\u201d Furthermore \u2018\u2018all Boxes & Packages of Letters which hereafter shall be brought over from Virginia or ye Summer Islands during this Commission\u201d were to be \u2018\u2018 immediately delivered to ye Commissioners by them  @ List of Records, No. 467.

A careful search for the missing papers must commence at this point. Although the records, or at least the court hooks, were later returned to the company, some of them may have been retained by the commissioners or by individuals thereof, Therefore, hidden away in the collections of the heirs of these men, it might be supposed, would be found the much sought-for documents. The members of this commission, created April 17, were Sir William Jones, Sir Nicholas Fortescue, Sir Francis Gofton, Sir Richard Sutton, Sir William Pitt, Sir Henry Bouchier, and Sir Henry Spiller. But, as far as can be determined from personal investigation, from the report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, from conversa- tion with Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, of that body, or from other men conversant with the private and public depositories in England, none of the papers did remain in the possession of those commissioners.  A committee of the Privy Council may have had access to these papers, for on July 22 Lords Grandison, Carew, and Chichester were appointed to take into con- sideration the reports on the colony and to present to the council orders most fit for the regulation of the government of Virginia.\u201c Another group of men intrusted with the investigation of affairs at that time, and into whose hands and private possession might have come papers belonging to the company, were John Harvey, John Pory, Abraham Percy, Samuell Matthews, and John Jefferson. This commis- gion was sent to Virginia for the purpose of investigating conditions, and many of the documents bearing on their relations with the colony are among the colonial State papers.  The documents remained in the custody of the commission until November 21, and were then returned to the secretary of the company. An order in council declared that all the \u2018\u2018 Books and writings, whether remayneing in the hands of the Com\" or elswher, shalbe fwthw\u2122 deliuered by Inventorie vnto the said Company.\u201d The complaint had been made by the treasurer that they could not make answer to the guo warranto which had been issued out of the King\u2019s Bench against the company without the use of their records.\u2019 Therefore, from November, 1623, until June,  @ List of Records, No, 513. + Ibid., No 580. \u00a2 For the order in council creating this commission, see Ibid., No. 499.  @ Ibid., No. 547. \u00a2 Ibid., No. 593.

    "319": "110 INTRODUCTION  1624, the company was in possession of its documents, and it was during that period that Nicholas Ferrar was busily engaged in having them transcribed.  The last order which concerned these records from December 30, 1623, until the company was finally overthrown, in June of the following year\u2014when the organi- zation, according to Nethersole, became a company for trade and not for government\u2014 was a letter of the council to \u2018\u2018 Nicholas Ferrar, Deputie,\u201d to bring tothem unopened all letters which had come ina sbip lately arrived from Virginia.\u00a2 That the King in the meantime was concerned in the preservation of all papers relating to Virginia is seen in a letter from Secretary Conway to Sir Thomas Merry, in which he was requested to preserve all papers in the possession of \u2018\u2018 his late cousin,\u201d John Puntis, vice-admiral of Virginia, and any others which concerned the business.?  Following up the recall of the charter, the Privy Council declared that it was the King\u2019s intention to renew the charter of the company without the imperfections of the former grant. A committee was therefore appointed on June 24 to resolve on the well settling of the colony, to give the orders therefor, and to report to the King for further directions. This body consisted of Lord President Mandeville, Lord Paget, Lord Chichester, the lord treasurer, the comptroller, the principal secretaries of state, the chancellor of the exchequer, the chancellor of the duchy, the attorney- general, the solicitor-general, Sir Robert Killigrew, Sir Thomas Smythe, Francis Gofton, John Wolstenholme, and Alderman Johnson.\u2018  Two days later an order in council was issued instructing Mr. Ferrar, deputy of the company, to bring to the council chamber all patents, books of accounts, and invoices of the late corporation and all lists of people in the colony, to be retained by the keeper of the council chest till further order.\u00a2 Thus was ended the control of the government by the old organization, if not of the affairs of the company and its colony, and thus the records passed into the charge of the clerk of the Privy Council.  A commission to establish a government in Virginia is to be found in the chan- cery privy seals under July of the twenty-second year of James I, countersigned to pass by immediate warrant. The patent roll of the period records this commission, dated July 15, 1624, by which the Virginia Company was to be supplanted and the first royal province in America was to be established. The records of the old com- pany, however, are not lost to sight till three days later. On July 15 the commis- sioners met at Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s house and determined that the charters, seals, and writings of the company were to be brought to Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s house and  @ For the order in council creating this commission, see List of Records, No. 608. b List of Records, No. 683. 4 Tbid., No. 689. \u00a2 Ibid., No. 687. \u00a2 Ibid., No. 701.

Fotherby, to be used by the commissioners at pleasure.\u201d  In the Privy Council register, under date of June 26, 1624, there is an order for Mr. Ferrar to deposit in the council chamber the papers of the late corporation, and in the margin is a note which gives the last glimpse of those records. It reads as follows: \u2018\u2018Nd: All theis Patents bookes of accounts &c were delivered to Henry Fotherby clarke to the Comissioners, by order from the Lords the 19 of July 1624,\u201d  That these members of the Privy Council and others of the commissioners for Virginia had all of the original records of the company in their possession at that date is thus proved. What became of them later can be a matter only of specu- lation. That they had been so carefully preserved and were deposited \u2018 for use by the members of the commissioners,\u201d seems to indicate that the theory of their destruction by the Crown is not tenable. There are two theories which seem much more likely. It may be that they passed finally into the possession of the Privy Council, which evidently soon assumed the burden of the control of the affairs of the province; for, on May 13, 1625, a royal proclamation arranged for a council which was to be subordinate to the Privy Council.\u201c The papers may thus have remained with the King\u2019s Council until the creation of the commission for Virginia in 1631, which in turn was supplanted by the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Plantations in 1634.4 The commission created in July of 1624 was composed of the lords of the council and \u2018\u2018 certain others,\u201d and the council register seems to indicate that it was usually the council sitting as a commission.

Another theory as to the fate of the records is that they were at first in charge of Henry Fotherby, clerk of the commissioners, but that they were gradually scattered among the members of the commission most interested in the career of the company as the authority of the commission became purely that of government. The members of the commission, created July 15, 1624, in whose families such papers might be found, are as follows: Henry Viscount Mandeville, Lord President of the Council, Wm. Lord Paget, Anthony Lord Chichester, Sir Thomas Edmonds, Sir John Suckling, Sir Geo. Calvert, Sir Edward Conway, Sir Richard Western, Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Humphrey May, Sir Saville Hicks, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Henry Mildmay, Sir Thomas Coventry, Sir Robert Heath, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Robert Killigrew, Sir Charles Montague, Sir Philip Carew, Sir Francis Goston [Gofton], Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir John Wolstenholme, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Sir Samuel Argall, Sir Humphrey Handford, Mathew Sutcliff, Dean of Exeter, Francis White, Dean of Carlisle, Thomas Tamshaw, Alderman Robert Johnson, James Cambell, Ralph Freeman, Morris Abbott, Nathaniel Butler, George Wilmore, William Hackwell, John Mildmay, Philip Germayne, Edward Johnson, Thomas Gibbes, Samuel Wrote, John Porey (?), Michael Hawes, Edward Palavacine, Robert Bateman, Martin Bond, Thomas Styles, Nicholas Leate, Robert Butt, Abraham Cartwright, Richard Edwards, John Dyke, Anthony Aldy, William Palmer, Edward Ditchfield, George Mole, and Richard Morer.\u00a2  Had not the receipt from the Privy Council to the secretary of the company revealed the existence of the early records in 1623, and had not the memoranda of Sir Nathaniel Rich confirmed the fact,\u2019 the theory might be put forth that the papers of the early period were burned in the destruction of Sir Thomas Smythe\u2019s house at Deptford on February 6, 1618/19. The fire at Whitehall on the 16th of January, 1618/19, at which the privy seal, signet, and council records are supposed to have been destroyed, is sometimes suggested as the cause of the disappearance of the Virginia records. But the facts given above, in addition to the statement of Sir Thomas Wilson to the King that there had been but little loss of papers since they had been transferred to the new oflice refutes that theory.\u00a2  It remains for the future enquirer to examine the collections which are known to contain papers belonging to the families indicated by the names of the various com- missioners and of the Privy Councillors for that period. Such investigations are made difficult by the transfer of papers from one branch of a family to another, necessitating  @ Virginia Magazine of History, VII, 40. + Ante, pp. 25, 63. \u00a2 Documents relating to the History of the Public Record Office, in the Record Office.

    "322": "FATE OF THE ORIGINAL RECORDS Lite  a knowledge of the genealogy of the various families represented. Having found the heirs of the families in question, the search may then be conducted through the reports of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. But this is not sufficient. Since trace of the family is often lost, or no evidence can be found of collections of docu- ments, it becomes necessary to search through every section of those reports of the commission for stray sets of papers. The greatest confusion also results from the sale of libraries, and while the catalogues of Quaritch or Sotheby may afford a clue to the offer of such material for sale, often in small lots, the name of the purchaser is not usually to be discovered. The result is that the student must wait in patience until the papers have drifted into some great depository\u2014such as the British Museum and the Bodleian Library\u2014or until they have been made known to the public through the Manuscripts Commission or by private enterprise.?  Another difficulty, which can not be overcome by the individual student, is the insufficiency of the catalogues of early date. This is gradually being met by the re-issue of catalogues and calendars in the British Museum, and the Bodleian, although the new catalogue of the latter is only \u2018\u2018summary.\u201d The Ashmolean and Rawlinson papers in the Bodleian may afford many surprises. Furthermore, the early reports of the Manuscripts Commission were often incomplete and too general in character. However, the more recent volumes are full calendars, and the older volumes may be republished in time.  In the great collections of the British Museum are brought together the papers or portions of the papers of a few of the men with whom we are concerned. In the Lansdowne collection are about one-third of the papers of Sir Julius Caesar, master of the rolls, which were sold at auction in 1757. Among these have been found the valuable letters of John Martin and the draft of the commission of 1624. In the Harleian collection, brought together by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, at the close of the seventeenth century, and among the papers of Sir John Cotton, who was a noted antiquarian of the time of James I, are a few important documents.  The valuable collection of the Marquis of Bath, containing the Cecil papers, has been recatalogued and found to contain nothing which concerns the company after 1616, and nothing of the earlier period not known to Alexander Brown.  Two other collections, imperfectly calendared by the Manuscripts Commission, are those of Lord Sackville, of Knole, Seven Oaks, Kent, and of the Earl of Coventry, Croome Court, Severn Stoke, Worcestershire. Since the statement was made by John Ferrar, in the later years of his life, that Sir Robert Killigrew had left the Virginia papers to Sir Edward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset, our interest in  @The search for the records has not only been conducted along these lines, but the collections belonging to the families of the officers of State under James I, and Charles I, have been investigated. ",
    "323": "114 INTRODUCTION  this collection is intensified. Both Sir Robert Killigrew and Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset, are seen to have been vitally connected with the company and the settle- ment of its affairs. Two other connections of this family may have brought together collections which might contain Virginia papers. Richard Sackville, Karl of Dorset, married Frances, the daughter of Lionel Cranfield, the first Earl of Middlesex, and he himself became heir to the Crantield house and title as third earl. The first Earl of Middlesex was the lord treasurer during the r\u00e9gime of the company and figures prominently as the individual who conducted the guo warrantv suit against the Virginia Company. Furthermore, Lionel Sackville West is the direct descendant of Lord De La Warr, of Virginia fame. The combination of the four houses of Killigrew, Sackville, Middlesex, and De La Warr, which were of so great importance in Virginia affairs, leads to the hope of a valuable collection of manuscripts. Four documents are mentioned in the report of the commission, and these refer to the tobacco trade, but an inquiry of Lord Sackville as to other material in his posses- sion clicited the reply from Lionel Sackville West that Lord Sackville knew of \u2018\u2018no other papers at Knole relating to the colony of Virginia than those mentioned in the report of the commissioners.\u201d It may be, however, that a more careful calendar of this collection will disclose papers of great importance.  From March 14, 1616, to January 11, 1620, Thomas Coventry was solicitor- general; later, during the Sandys-Southampton administration of the Virginia Company, he held the position of attorney-general. On November 1, 1625, he became lord keeper, and remained in that office during the period coinciding with the organization of the colonial administration. Hence it was that, when it was found from the report of the Manuscripts Commission that many of Lord Keeper Coventry\u2019s papers had not been investigated, the Editor addressed a letter to the Earl of Coventry, Croome Court. This resulted in a confirmation of the statement, and a promise to search the papers which are now in the \u2018strong room here.\u201d In a letter to Ambassador Choate, July 27, 1904, the Earl of Cov- entry made the following statement: \u2018\u2018In company with a son I went through the boxes containing papers of the Lord Keeper Coventry in which I thought it likely I might find the documents referring to the Virginia Company of London, some time ago, but I could discover nothing relating to the company.\u201d The letter goes on to say that the \u2018\u2018papers are in bad condition and very difficult to decipher.\u201d Hence the conclusion may be reached that this most likely hiding place for Virginia records is not to reveal new material.  The collections at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, and at Hatfield House, are extremely valuable, but T. Fitzroy Fenwick, esq., the present owner of the former, states that there is no materia] in that collection relating to the early history of Virginia, and a manuscript catalogue, kindly loaned to the writer by Lord Salisbury, ",
    "324": "FATE OF THE ORIGINAL RECORDS 115  indicates that the papers at Hatfield House, now being calendared, have no bearing on the subject in hand.  By tracing the family connections of the descendants of Sir Thomas Smythe and the Earl of Southampton intermarriages are found which might result in the location of valuable papers in many of the large depositories. All of these have been investigated by the Manuscripts Commission. Thus, from Sir Thomas Smythe the documents might have been inherited by the first or the second Earl of Leicester; by Sir Sydney Stafford Smythe, baron of the exchequer in 1772 and last of the descendants of the male line; by the eighth Viscount Strangford, vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society, with whose death in 1869 the senior branch of the family was terminated; and by the present Duke of Marlborough through the second marriage of Lady Dorothy Sydney Smythe, daughter of Robert, second Earl of Leicester. The Wriothesley family is to-day represented in the houses of the Duke of Bedford and of the Duke of Portland, the former having inherited the London property of Robert, third Earl of Southampton, and the latter the Tichtield estate.  The large number of documents among the Smyth of Nibley papers\u00ae suggests that in private collections may be many records which concern the private enterprises or companies formed within the corporation for setting out plantations and carrying on trade. Other groups of manuscripts and early books have seemed to offer opportunities for the discovery of the missing records. But the Lambeth Palace Library, the college libraries both of Oxford and of Cambridge have proved value- less, with the exception of that most important group in Magdelene College, Cambridge. Every one of the college libraries, has been searched or investigated, but to no avail. All Souls College, Oxford, contains a collection of manuscripts which may afford a few papers on the subject when it has been more carefully catalogued.  The fact that the original records of the company before 1619, and a compara- tively small portion after that date have not been discovered has led generally to the conclusion that the party of the Crown destroyed the evidences of the misman- agement during the first decade and of the comparatively prosperous condition in the second. That they failed to take into account the records in the colony and the Ferrar transcripts of the court book is the good fortune of posterity. But the destruction of the records can not properly be considered as proved until the public collections have been more carefully calendared and the private collections have been more thoroughly investigated. The absolute lack of evidence that the Crown and its supporters held such an attitude and the knowledge that the commissioners took the records into their charge \u2018\u2018for use\u201d encourages the hope that a faithful endeavor to discover their location may yet be rewarded by success.  @Ante, p. 55.

And secondly that by reason of his extraordinary busines, dishabillity in body, and ke because he would be ready to answere to any difficulty, requested, that the Audite might be kept at his howse, and to goe forward w\" the Ace? of the Cashe, w\u2122 he onely is ingaged for and noe other; And what damage appeareth hath beene done to the Company hy such Officers as he trusted he will satisfy to the vttmost: But vpon profes- sion that the said lawe was not to preiudice or debarr 8\u2019 Thomas Smith from the benefitt of the said old Accompte, they were agreed to be putt to the question: W\u2122 being done, they were generally con- firmed by erecGon of hande.

But forasmuch as it is obiected that the said Captaine Argoll proceeded vnduely, Capt Brewster comitting noe crime worthy of death, and being also alleaged that he was first condempned and afterward called vunto his Answere, w\u2122 the Counsell and Court here cann not iudge of, but is to be tryed there, where the euidence may be giuen; It was therefore now ordered, that the said Appeale and Captaine Argolls answere therevnto shalbe sent inclozed w'\"in a tre of the Companies to S' George Yeardley and the Counsell of State, and they to make examina\u00e9on of the cause and returne Certificate thereof.

W*\" was answered by mn\u2019 Thier, that one reason why they should be vndeuided, was, that from time to time they might receaue their authority from the Gen- erall Co\": and m\u00e9 Aldfan well said, they were not tyed to a pertieuler place of meeting, therefore he would be willing (if the Court should soe like of it) that they should meet sometimes at S\u2019 Thomas Smiths, at such time as S' Thomas Smith should haue occasion to desire to be present. And for the 1000\" w\" St Thomas Smith, 8\u2019 Iohn Wol- stenholme, and m\u2019 Alderman Iohnson standeth bound he held it not convenient to haue any Diuident till that were paid.

To the w\u201d, reply was made by S' Edwin Sandis Ther, that hauing beene privately acquaynted w\u2122 this mo\u00e9on, and haning throughly waighed it, he could not giue way vnto for flower reasons; ",
    "455": "JULY 21, 1619 249  1. ffirst it was contrary to his Ma\u2122 Eres Pattents;  2. Secondly it was repugnant to y\u00b0 Standing orders of the y\u00b0 Company. 3. Thirdly it failed of the very end it aymed at, for it was not any advancem' to the planting of Martins hundred.  4. ffourthly it was preiudiciall & that in a high degree to the Generall Plantacon, & to y\u00b0 strength, peace & prosperity of y\u00b0 Collony. [31]  He began w\" the second reason as being fresh in memory, & reading the Orders in the title of Graunts, he shewed, that all Lande were to be graunted either to Planters in Virginia by their persons, or to Adventurers by their purses, or by extraordinary merritts of service. Thatthe Adventurers by their purses, were they onely and their Assign - ees, who paid in their seuerall shares of\u201412\u201410\u2014to the Comon Treas- ure for the charges of transporting men to the priuate Lands of the Adventurers, there was also allowance made to them of 50 Acres the person. But noe further allowance for any such prinate expences as was now demaunded.  Then he eame to the first reason, and shewed that these Orders were not newly deuised, but taken out of the Lres Pattent\u20ac, namely the second & third; diuers passages of w'\" he there openly read, importing that the Land\u00a2 in Virginia were to be deuided amongst the Adven- turers by mony, or service and the Planters in person, and that he is to be reputed an Adventurer by money, who payeth it into the Com- panies Treasury, insomuch that if any man be admitted for an Adven- turer, and haue paid in noe mony to the Comion Treasury, he is to be compelled thereto by suite of Lawe, yea though he neuer subscribed to any such payment, as is expresly sett downe in the Third Lres Pattent\u00a2.  Thirdly he shewed, it was not beneficiall to them of Martins hundred in point of advantaging their perticuler Planta\u00e9on, for the benetitt grew not by a bare title to Land, but by cultivating & peopling it so to reape proffitt, now of such Land it was in euery Adventurers power to haue asmuch as he pleased w'out any other payment: ffor if an Adventurer (for examples sake) who had but one share of One hun- dreth Acres would send ouer Twenty men to inhabite & occupy it. ",
    "456": "250 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  fewer at this day will not doe it, he was by the Orders allready estab- lished to haue for these 20 an addition of\u20141000\u2014Acres of Land vpon a first deuision and as much more vpon a second; And if then he would also people his\u20141000\u2014Acres w' Ten score men more, he were to haue another addition of\u201410000\u2014Acres more vpon a first deuision and asmuch vpon a second, & so forward to what extent of Land him - selfe should desire. On the other side to enlarge a mans right vnto new Land, and not to make vse and proflitt of the Old, were to increase a matter of opinion, rather then of realty, & a shadowe rather then a substance.  Lastly he said it was prieiudiciall to the Generall Planta\u00e9on in many points of ymportance; first in matter of strength for those titles to great extent of Land; so to keepe other from it, would be a great weakning to the Collony by disioyning the parts of it one so farr from another Vis Vnita Fortior.  Againe it would be a great discouragem' to new perticule\u2019 Planta\u00e9ons if either they must sitt downe of bad land, the best being all taken vp before in titles, or seeke a seate farr of remote from helpe and society: Besides whereas by the orders now established, men are to encrease their owne Land\u00e9 there by transporting of people, and so by increasing the Collony in strength & multitude, the vertue and good intent of this Order wilbe defeated, if men may haue their Land@ encreased w\" out such transporta\u00e9on, & onely by fauo\u2019 & plurallity of voie@ in Co\",  [32] Nowe as this mo\u00e9on is prieindiciall to y\u00b0 strength & encrease of the Plantation, so is it also to the peace thereof, good government and iustice: It is not inst that a man should be paid twice for the same thing; ffor the men transported they haue allready allowance of Land \u201450\u2014Acres the person whither dead or huing: And the Charges now spoken of was but in transporting those men. It is not iust, that things equall should be vnequally valued; As Martins hundred hath beene at great charges, so Shaue\u00a7 divers other hundreds, so haue also beene many perticuler persons, Captaine Bargraue alone hath bought and sett out diuers shipps; if besides the persons transported, he shall haue allowance of Land oueragaine for all his charges, perhaps he may take vp a great part of the River: What may my Lo: Lawarr ",
    "457": "JULY 21, 1619 251  doe? Sir Tho: Gates, and 8' Tho: Dale, besides a multitude of other who haue spent a Large por\u00e9on of their Estates therein and are not thought on; if all these men come in w\u2122 their Accounts for all their tyme, what a confusion & disturbance will ensue thereof? shall wee deny that to them w* wee allowe vuto 0\u00b0 selues? or shall wee admitt of their demaund\u00e9 and sett them out Land accordingly? how then shall wee peeed in examining their Account? how may they be eleered? when would they be ended? this course is a Laborinth and hath noe issue.  He concluded, that he had allwayes fauoured the desires of Martins hundred; but for this perticuler, he would not approue it: Howheit if men were not satisfied w'\" these reasons, he would be well content, that the matter might be referred to a Quarter Court, vnto w\" it did more properly belong; and that in the meane time, it might be referred to the considera\u00e9on of a Grane Comittie to be indifferently chosen out of the Generallity and Counsell.  Vpon this S' Edward Harwood propounded, that for satisfaccon and encouragement of Martins hundred, there might be some quantity of Land bestowed vpon them by way of gratuity and sernice: w\u2122 was generally well liked,and the accomplishment thereof referred to the next Quarter Court, & in the meane time the matter should be pre- pared by a select Comittee.

Vpon some dispute of the Polonians resident in Virginia, it was now agreed (notw\" standing any former order to the contrary) that they shalbe enfranehized, and made as free as any inhabitant there what - soeuer: And because their skill in making pitch & tarr and sope- ",

Afterward in Aprill next twenty men should haue beene sent by Xofer Lawne vnto the Common Land, but he deliuered but 15 because the Company per- formed not w\u2122 him, touching the Loane of Corne and Cattle as he expected: Then 4 more were sent in the Triall according to the  1A blank space in the manuscript. 16455\u2014voL 1\u201406\u2014\u201417 ",

And in the begining of August Last, one hun- dreth more sent\u201450\u2014to the Colledge Land and 50 to the Comion: And for one hundreth persons or thereabout w\"\" appeareth to haue beene sent in these 2 or 3 last yeares at the Companies charges, S' Geo: Yeardley writeth of but three to be found remayning for the Company; So that there is by this Account vpon the Comon Land 72 persons, 53 on the Gouernors, and 50 on the Colledges: 175 in the whole. Therefore he proposed now to be considered of against the Quarter Court this day fortnight that there might be sent the next Spring 130 men more, w*\" will make those allready sent for the Gou- erno\u2019 Colledge, and Comion Land the full nomber of Three hundred, and so the Gouerno\u2019 to haue 100 men w\u2122 will not be lesse worth then One thowsand pound\u00e9 p Ann as it is esteemed. As for the benefitt of their labors of the Comon Land, it standeth otherwise, for their moity is to be denided betweene the Counsell and Officers there, [36] and for other publique vses, and betweene the Company here.  ffor the Counsell who attende\u00e9 there, when the Gouernor at all times shall please to call them, cannot neglect their busines w\"out reward; soe likewise here, the Company may not expect, that although their Tier for the time past and pnte, as also the Deputies of late serue meerely out of their zeale and loue to the Ac\u00e9on, yet those that shall sueceede will happily expect a yearely gratifica\u00e9on, when the Company shalbe enabled by their Rents to yeild it. And for the Colledge, there is noe doubt but the benefitt ensuing will build it, and raise a Revennue for the mayntenance. He also thought it fitt to send 100 more to be Prentizes or Servants that the rest may goe on more cheerefully, wherein he hoped the citty would deale as worthily as heretofore. Lastly he wished that a fitt hundreth might be sent of woemen, Maid\u20ac young and vneorrupt to make wifes to the Inhabitinte and by that meanes to make the men there more setled & lesse moueable who by defect thereof (as is credibly reported) stay there but to gett something and then to returne for England, w\u2122 will breed a dissolu\u00e9on, and so an ouerthrow of the Plantacon. These woemen if they marry to the publiq, ffarmors, to be transported at the charges of the Company; If otherwise, then those that takes them to wife to pay the said Company their charges of  ",
    "463": "NOVEMBER 3, 1619 257  transporta\u00e9on, and it was neuer fitter time to send them then nowe. Corne being here at home soe cheape and plentifull, and great prom - ises there for the Haruest ensuing. Then to euery 100 men, he aduised there might be sent 20 young Heifers w\u2122 wilbe Threescore, and they w\" their breed will soone store the Publique. He also shewed, that the Inhabitants hauing had great ioy by the Charters of Graunts and Liberties lately sent by 8\u2018 Geo: Yeardley, desired now to haue choise men sent them from the Lowe Countries to raise ffortifi- cations, whose charge they will beare, wherein my Lo: Generall Cesills assistance was perticulerly entreated. Then he spoke of the way of transporting these persons, w\u2019 by reason of the intollerable charge the Company is at by sending ships, that that course should be left of and rather send by those that trade to Newfoundland at Six pounde\u00e9 a man, w\u2122 wilbe found to be great ease vnto the Company; but for the Catle a shipp must be sent on purpose, vnlesse a bargayne may be made for them at 10\"\u2014 a peece, as he hath some hope giuen him that it may be. The totall charge of all this, furnishing the men reasonably w\" all things requisite, will amount (as he hath computed it) not aboue ffower thowsand pound\u00a2\u20ac; And one thowsand more will furnish them in best sort. Then how this mony shall come in, he shewed how much the Company was bound to giue thankes to God for all his blessings, who continually rayseth meanes for the supporting of this worke, making men\u00e9on of one vnknowne Gentleman that hath offred to send to him 500\"\u2014 for the converting and educa\u00e9on of Threescore Infidells Children, whensoeuer he shall require the same & vndertake that worke. And also that vpon his tres he had receaned advertizement from sundry parts and some of them very remote, that if they goe on w\" this busines they shall not want for money. Like- wise Gabriell Barbor [$7] hath promised of Lottary monies to bring in before the end of March 35 hundreth pounde, w\u2122 he intend\u00e9 accord - ing to the promise made vnto the Lord\u00a2 shall goe to noe other end but the advancement of the Plantagon. And for the Three thowsand pound\u00e9, w*\" was spoken of when he entred to be T\u00e9er he hath not as yet receaued the whole, but as it cometh in, it shall all goe for the payment of former debts and dueties, whereof he had discharged aboue 2000\" allready, promising that he will not leaue the Company ",
    "464": "258 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  one penny in debt by any Act to be done by him. And for the ratifi- eacon hereof, he referred it to the qrter Co\", onely now proposing it, that in the interim it might be considered of by the Company.  Next he acquainted, that the Counsell sitting this morning at my Lord of Southamptons, there were some mo\u00e9ons made for y\u00ae busines at home, one was concerning Tobacco in Generall, that the planting of it here would be the destruc\u00e9on of the Plantation, and therefore that the Company might be humble suito\u2122 for an inhibi\u00e9on thereof; but this was conceaued might be a seandall for Virginia, as that it could not subsist w\"out that weed, intending very shortly to sett in hand with Iron-workes, & the Country affording diuers other good comodities, as Silke, Silkegrasse, Corne, Vines, ete. And therefore it was thought better by the Counsell, forasmuch as the ffarmors of Impost had it on foote allready that they proceed, and the Company as they see oceasion to assist them. ffor the perticuler Tobacco of the Adventurers remayning in the Custome howse, he was desired by the Counsell to drawe a tre in their names, and to be signed by them, w he promised forthw\u2122 to performe, to be addressed vnto the Kings Lerned Counsell, shewing the priuiledges of their Pattent, and the Losse they haue sustayned by this extreame delay w\u2122 earnest request of present expedicon. And seeing that m' Iacobb contrary to the priuiledges of their said Pattent; the Letter of his Ma\u201d priny Counsell in their behalfe, and the Adventurers offer to leaue halfe w' him, that they might obtaine the other halfe to sell away that it might not all perish, had reiected all mo\u00e9ons and meanes of agreement, and in contempt of their Lo\u2019 Letter refused to deliver it vpon those reason - able condiGons sett downe by their Lps, that therefore he thought it very expedient (the Lord@ consent\u20ac being first obtayned) that the Company commence an Ac\u00e9on of damages against him, the losse they haue receaued being estimated by many at\u20142500\"\u2014w\u2122 mo\u00e9on so suted w' the desire of the Court (sauing that the Lord\u00a2 consent was thought vnnecessary) that for the rest they intreated it might be putt to the question: w\u2122 being done, and also propounding whither the suite shall proceed at the Comon charge, being for the maynteiince of the Pattent, and the Magazine to appoint Sollicitors, was ratified by ",

Wherevnto was answered, that these Proposi- \u00e9ons had beene formerly proposed to the Counsell at Southampton howse, where they were generally approued to be beneficiall and ",
    "468": "262 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY  advantagious for the Planta\u00e9on, And therefore not fitt they should be reassumed from thence to a priuate Comittie, Esteeming the Counsell the chiefest Comittee could be chosen. Also mr. T\u00e9er to the generall satisfacc\u00e9on of the whole Court made this answere, that for those nombers to be setled on the Comon, Gouernors and Colledge Land, he would not leaue the Company indebted one penny: As for former debts he had allready paid aboue 2000\" towarde\u00e9 discharging of them, and a 1000\" he would pay when it came in, w\" was asmuch as was left vuto him, doubting not but that the yearely comodities coming out of Virginia, would henceforward defray all accidentall charges; it hauing beene truly alleadged before, that the planting and peopling of the Companies Land was the surest way to bring in Revennue. It was alsoe answered by others, that all that was in Cashe was but to be imployed to the advancem\u2019 of the Plantaton, and that there could be noe better worke to further that then this, nor nothing more hurt- full then to leaue vnperformed those designes & workes w\u2122 themselues are certaine and good, for things accidentall and vucertaine; So as noe man further opposing, The former Obiec\u00e9on vanished. And it was moued by my Lo: of Southampton, that the Court hauing now heard the Proposi\u00e9ons read, if they made scruple of any thing, that it might be now debated at full against the Quarter Court. But noe man either seconding the former, or raising any new obiec\u00e9on, the Proposi\u00e9ons rested w\u2122 generall approba\u00e9on of the Court.  Touching the Legall seale spoken of in the last Court, the Auditors at their Assembly haue therein taken some paynes, w\u2122 they now pre- sented to this Courte: And whereas they had spoken to one for the cutting of it, there is one m\u2019 Hole who would appropriate that vnto him selfe vnder pretence of hauing a Pattent for the engrauing all seales, w hath the Kings Armes or any part thereof, w\" he now pre- sented to the Court, and m\u2019 Tfer pervsing the same, found, that it was for the Kinges armes, but not for any part thereof, and therefore appointed them to repaire to m* Xofer Brooke of Lincolnes Inne to examine it, and to bring his opinion vnder his hand in writing, & accordingly it should be determined.

The cause of this erro\u2019 he would not insist vpon, as loth to giue offence by glaunce of speech to any, but for remedy thereof (besides often letters from the Counsell sent lately to the Gouernour  ! This term refers to the Company land or property in Virginia.  ",
    "473": "NOVEMBER 17, 1619 267  for restraint of that imoderate following of Tobacco and to cause the people to apply themselues to other and better comodities) he had also by the advice of his Ma* Counsell here, and according to one of the new orders now propounded, caused to be drawne a new Covenant to be incerted in all Pattents of land hereafter to be graunted, that the Pattentees should not apply themselues wholly or chiefly to Tobacco, but to other Comodities specified in the said Coueint, An example whereof they should see in the Pattent lying before them to be passed in this Court to m\u2019 Iohn Delbridge and his Associats. Now touching the Publique, he was first to present to their remembrance how by the admirable industry of Two worthie knight\u00a2 S' Tho: Gates and S\u2018' Tho: Dale, it was sett forward in a way to greate perfeccon, whereof the former St Tho: Gates had the hono\u2019 to all posterity to be the first named in his Ma\u2018 Pattent of graunt of Virginia, and was the first who by his wisedome, valo\" & industry, accompanied w\" exceed - ing paines and patience in the middest of so many difficulties laid a founda\u00e9on of that prosperous estate of the Collonie, which afterward in the vertue of those beginings did proceed.

But since their times all these publiq, prouisions hauing beene vtterly Laid wast by such meanes as hereafter in due time shall appeare.

Yeardley 50 Tenante for the Gouerno\u2122 Land transported at the Companies and furnished at his charge, and six he found remayning of Capt Argolls guarde: In the March afterward there were sent \u00a7twenty\u00a7 to the Companies Land by M\u2019 Lawne, whereof he hath deliuered yet but 15, for want of per- formance to him of loane of Corne and Cattle: ffower more were sent by the Triall, and Three S' Geo: Yeardley found in the Country. In the begining of August last in the Bona Noua were sent 100 persons for publiq, service, chosen w\" great care, and extraordinarily furnished, whereof 50 for the Companies Land, and 50 for the Colledge Land, So that making deduccon of some fewe that are dead, there were he hoped at this day 174 persons, placed as Tenants vpon the Publique.  Therefore his first Proposition was, that the Company would be pleased, that these Tenants for the Publiq, might be encreased this next Spring vp to the nomber of 300, viz\" one hundreth for the Gouernors Land, 100 for the Companies and 100 for the Colledge Land; w*\" (if he be truly informed by those whoe best should knowe it) being rightly imployed will not yeild lesse in value then Three thowsand pound\u00e9 yearely revenue for these publiq vses. And because care both hath beene, and shalbe taken that divers stayed persons and of good condiGons haue beene and shalbe sent amongst them, His second ProposiGon was, that for their ease and comodiousnes, there might be 100 young persons sent to be their Apprentices, in the charge whereof he hoped this Hono\u2122 Citty, would pertake w\u201d the Company  $$ SS a errr ",

His next Proposi\u00e9on was, for the manno' of transporting these per- sons thus to make vp ffiue hundreth for the Publiq, Land, wherein he advised, that they should not as heretofore hire Shipping for this purpose, whereof euery Shipp at his returne in bare fraught and wages emptied the Cashe of 800 and sometimes 1000\", but that they should as they had allreadie done this present yeare take the opportun - itie of the Ships trading to Newfoundland, and so to transport them at six poundes a person w\"out after reckonings.

Lastly touching the charges he related perticulerly as formerly he had done, diuers great incouragements of supply to come in: he estimated the whole charge at ffoure thousand pounde\u00e9 to be done sparingly & bountifully at 5000\": He promised not to leaue the Company one penny in debt for any thing in his yeare to be performed: And more- ouer that he would discharge 3000\" of former debts and reckonings according to the Stock left in the Lottaries at his coming to this place: This done he hoped the Publiq, would agayne be well restored, A founda\u00e9on Laid for a future great state, The Adventurers and Planters well comforted and encouraged, All matter of secandall and reproach remoued, and so he would comend the Ac\u00e9on to the blessing of God. These Proposi\u00e9ons after some pause, receauing noe opposicon were putt to the question & receaued the generall approba\u00e9on of the Court. ",
