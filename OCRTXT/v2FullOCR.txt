preface 


The  records  of  the  Vu-ginia  Company  during  the  first  tlu-ee  months  of  the  years 
from  January,  1622/23  to  Januaiy,  1624/25,  picture  the  final  attempts  to  regulate 
and  develop  the  tobacco  trade  with  Virginia.  Then  foUow  papers  revealing  the 
bitter  attack  upon  the  Earl  of  Southampton  and  the  adventurers  associated  with 
him,  by  Sir  Nathaniel  Rich  and  the  defenders  of  Sir  Thomas  Smith's  regime. 
Throughout  the  whole  period  are  portrayed  the  struggle  of  the  plantation  to  recover 
from  the  Indian  massacre  of  March  22,  1622,  and  the  efforts  made  by  the 
officials  in  London  and  by  the  Governor,  Council,  and  Assembly  in  Virginia. 

The  most  important  and  perhaps  unique  docimient  of  the  entire  series  published 
in  volumes  III  and  IV  of  the  Records  of  the  Virginia  Company  is  the  Records  of  Pro- 
ceedings upon  Information  of  Quo  Warranto  in  the  Court  of  King's  Bench,  found  by 
the  editor  in  the  Public  Record  Office,  London.  It,  alone,  covers  one  hundred  pages 
of  volume  IV.  The  largest  number  of  documents  come  from  the  Manuscript 
Records  of  the  Virginia  Company,  Volume  III.  Like  volumes  I  and  II,  comprising 
the  minutes  of  the  London  company,  it  is  deposited  in  the  Library  of  Congress, 
Washington,  District  of  Columbia.  In  it  are  spread  the  official  papers  of  the 
Governor,  Council  and  Assembly  of  Virginia.  They  include  letters  to  and  from 
the  officers  of  the  Virginia  Company  of  London,  commissions  issued,  orders  declared, 
petitions  granted,  warrants  for  elections,  statements  of  the  condition  of  the  colony 
and  other  documents  revealing  the  history  of  the  phintation. 

A  long  series  of  papers  shedding  much  light  on  the  terrific  conffict  within  the 
Company,  resulting  in  its  dissolution  by  Quo  Warranto  proceedings,  comes  from 
the  Manchester  Papers,  now  in  the  Public  Record  Office,  London,  being  largely 
letters  and  memoranda  of  Sir  Nathaniel  Rich. 

The  Colonial  Office  Papers  in  the  Public  Record  Office,  the  Ferrar  Papers,  and 
the  Papers  of  Lord  Sackville,  now  deposited  at  Knole  Park,  Kent,  each  suppUed  a 
number  of  important  documents. 

In  tliis  volume,  then,  is  to  be  found  the  record  of  the  dissension  within  the 
company  that  brought  about  the  close  of  the  corporation  and  the  end  of  the  first 
period  of  the  colony's  history.  At  the  same  time  the  beginning  of  Virginia  as  a 
crown  colony  is  set  forth.  Here  also  is  portrayed  the  settled  life  of  the  plantation. 
Much  is  told  of  the  colonists  and  their  efforts  to  create  an  organized  and  systematic 
government,  to  produce  commodities  that  would  provide  the  necessities  for  hving, 
and  to  develop  resources  that  might  result  in  needful  trade  with  the  Indians  and 
with  England. 


Two  documents  of  importance,  inadvertently  omitted  at  first,  but  now  numbered 
CCCXLVA  and  CDXXXVII  A,  will  be  found,  not  in  their  clironological  place, 
but  at  the  end  of  the  volume,  as  Addenda. 

The  editor  wishes  to  make  acknowledgment  to  Dr.  Hubert  Hall  for  his  labors 
in  supervising  the  transcript  of  the  Quo  Warranto  Proceedings  and  in  translating 
the  entire  document. 

As  in  the  previous  volume,  the  editor  is  deeply  indebted  to  Professor  J.Franklin 
Jameson  for  his  continued  care  in  seeing  the  document  through  the  press;  to  Marian 
Carter  Anderson  for  her  assistance  in  preparing  the  manuscript  for  the  press  and  in 
the  difliculties  of  reading  the  proof.  Helen  Kingsbury  Zirkle  has  prepared  the 
index  for  this  volume  as  she  did  for  Volume  III,  and  to  her  again  the  editor  wishes 
to  express  appreciation  of  her  contribution. 

A  part  of  the  expense  of  arranging  the  manuscript,  reading  the  proof,  and 
making  the  index  was  met  by  a  grant  from  the  Social  Science  Research  Council.

Most  reuerend  Fath9  in  God,  right  trusty  &  welbeloued  Counsello9, 
wee  greete  yo"  well.  You  haue§  heard  §  ere  this  time  of  the  attempt  of

of  0''  Ires  patent?)  people  of  this  kingdome,  aswell  for  y^  enlarging  of 
o'  Dominions  as  for  propagation  of  the  Gospell  amongst  Infidells:  wherein 
there  is  good  progresse  made,  and  hope  of  further  increase.  So  as  the 
Vndertakers  of  y'  Plantation  are  now  in  hand  w'^  the  erecting  of  some 
Churches  &  Schooles  for  the  education  of  the  children  of  those  Barbarians:

A  comiwirison  of  the  former  estates  of  the  Companies  for  their  Tobacco, 
with  what  it  is  nowe  by  this  Contract. 

First  in  the  yeare  1619  there  came  neare  vpon  70000:  weight  of  Tobacco 
from  the  Suiner  Island^:  great  quantities  whereof  were  sold  for  twelue 
pence  the  pound,  and  generally  2"  the  pound  was  the  highest  price  that 
it  was  sold  at. 

There  came  the  end  of  that  yeare;  and  the  begininge  of  the  yeare  1620 
for  the  Account  of  the  Magazine  for  Virginia  about  26000:  weight:  whereof 
about  20000:  weight  was  bought  by  Alderman  Johnson  and  his  partners 
for  lesse  then  2'  3''  a  pound:  and  generally  one  with  another  the  Tobaccoes 
returned  from  Virginia  that  yeare  were  not  sold  for  2^*  a  pound  or  not 
aboue. 

So  that  the  estate  of  the  Companies  was  that  indeed  except  some  Rctaylors, 
there  was  not  generally  made  aboue  2"  a  pound  towards  all  Charge. 
And  this  price  was  likely  to  decay  euery  yeare  as  greater  abundance  of 
Tobacco  came  in:  wherevpon  in  the  yeare  1620  in  March,  there  was  a 
Charter  sent  to  the  Colonie  in  Virginia  from  the  Companie  here,  where- 
in llicy  directly  declared  vnto  them,  that  they  .should  not  e.xpcct  more 
then  twelue  ])cncc  a  pound  in  Virginia. 

>  Indorsement  in  in  a  modern  liand. 


1622/3  (?)  3 

Nowe  putting  this  to  be  §  the  §  true  state  that  Tobacco  was  soldo,  this 
Contract  will  put  vs  in  better  case:  fe?  then 


for    then   3    pound    sent 

home  at  2'  made 

But  the  King  had  of  it_- 
w"^  was  to  be  layd  downe 
in  ready  money  before  the 
Owner  might  haue  his  To- 
bacco w'^"  doun  vpon  his 
3  pound  he  only  cleared  __ 


'Nowe  bringing  home  3  poiind  of  Tobacco,  the  King 
hath  one  And  then  tlie  two  other  l)eing  sold  p  —  4" 
whereof    the    Iving    hath    1"    And    then    the   owner 

.  cleares  —  3". 


So  that  in  this  case  the  owner  hath  asmuch  money  and  a  great  deale  of 
advantage,  in  reguard  that  by  the  former  Course  to  a  bad  Comodity,  he 
layeth  downe  half  money,  whereas  here,  he  layd  downe  but  a  sixt. 

[2]  But  tfe  perhapps  it  wilbe  said  that  this  was  the  Lowest  priee  rate  of 
the  Tobacco  and  that  there  was  sold  at  2'  6*^  or  3"  p  pound:  then  the  com- 
parison stands  thus. 


3  pounds  of  Tobacco  at_  2^  C^ 

was  sold  for 7  G 

The  King  had 3  0 

So    then   remayned    to 

the  Owner  liut 4  6 


Nowe  of  3  pound  l)rought  tlie  King  hath  one,  the 

other  two  being  sold  for  —  2'  6"^  p  pound 5" 

wherein  the  Iving  hath 1"    0 

So  the  owner  hath  but 4"    0 


And  if  in  case  the  Contract  makes  Tobacco  to  yeald  Lesse  by 
3.  ])ound  sold  at  3''  y  pound 


3''  p  pound. 


yeakl 9» 

the  King  had 3° 

then    there    remayned    to 

the  owner G" 


Nowe  the  King  hath  of  3  pound  one  and  the  other 

2  pounds  sold  at  2"  yeald G" 

But  the  King  is  to  haue  for  Custome 1" 

Then  there  remaynes  to  the  owner  but 5" 


So  this  Tobacco  formerly  solde  for  3'  p  pound,  w'*"  was  the  highest  price, 
and  whereof  but  a  verie  litle  quantity,  this  Contract  yealdes  lesse  —  6''  p 
pound.  But  for  that  6''  the  Company  by  this  Contract  hath  the  sole 
sale  and  sole  Importacon,  whereby  vndoubtedly  the  price  wilbc  doubly 
raysed:  so  that  this  Contract  bettereth  the  Company.

vpon  us  soe  Royall  a  gift  of  Amies  &  munitione  w'^''  we  resolve  to  ymploy 
to  y-  honor  of  our  Countrey  and  revenge  of  his  subiects  bloud,  for  w'''' 
munitione  and  his  gratious  intentione  of  sujiplyinge  us  w"'  i^eople,  we 
beseech  you  to  j^sent  our  most  huml:)le  thanks  to  his  sacred  Ma''*" 

In  the  next  place  wee  must  acknowledg  y"  hande  of  heauen  also,  that  hath 
not  suffered  the  zeale  to  this  Plantatione  to  dye  or  grow  colde  in  y=  ' 
bosomes  of  you  the  Hono*^"'  Companie,  but  that  you  conceive  yt  rightlie 
as  a  cause  of  the  future  strength,  not  a  decay  of  this  Colonic,  w"''  before  ran 
in  a  more  dangerous,  though  in  a  more  plausible  manner. 

Wee  haue  anticipated  your  desires  by  settinge  vppon  the  Indyans  in  all 
places,  m''  Trevr  firste  fell  vppon  the  Tapahatonahs,  in  two  scvcrall 
expeditions,  Sr.  George  j^ardley  vppon  y""  Wyanokes  and  in  a  seconde

seate  of  Sansapen  &  apochankeno,  Capt  John  West  vppon  the  Tanx  Pow- 
hatans,  and  Capt  9  William  Powell  vppon  the  Chocohominj^  Capt  Hamer 
beinge  sent  to  the  Patomecks  to  trade  for  Corne  slew  divers  of  y''  Neco- 
chincos  y'  sought  to  Circumvent  hun  by  treacherie,  The  like  did  Capt 
madisone  at  Patomeck,  Capt  9  Hamer  a  seconde  tyme  ymployde  to  Patao- 
meck  for  Corne  slew  some  others  y'  pved  our  enemies,  And  now  is  Cajit 
Tucker  in  the  River  of  Rapahanock  to  take  revenge  vppon  them,  as

he  frely  yuiployd  his  shippinge,  shallops,  niaryners,  and  servants  Besids 
there  hath  been  brought  in  by  trade  and  force  3000  bushells  more,  wherin 
we  haue  been  forced  to  ymploy  many  pties  of  men,  the  necessitie  whcrof 
beeinge  fore  seene  by  us  was  one  cause  why  wee  drew  into  fewer  bodies. 

By  conferenc  of  former  experyences  w"'  those  of  ours  vppon  the  Salvages, 
it  is  most  aparant  that  they  are  an  enemy  nott  suddenlie  to  be  destroyde 
w"'  the  swoi'de  by  rcasone  of  theire  swyftnes  of  foote,  and  advantages  of 
the  wood^,  to  w"''  vppon  all  ou'  assaults  they  retyre  but  by  the  way  of 
starvinge  and  all  other  meanes  y'  we  can  possiblely  devise  we  will  Con- 
stantlie  pursue  their  extirpatione.  By  Computatione  and  Confessione  of 
the  Indyans  themselves  we  have  slayne  more  of  them  this  yecre,  then 
hath  been  slayne  before  since  th"  begininge  of  y''  Colonie. 

Wheras  in  the  begininge  of  your  Lres  by  the  Trewloue  you  pass  soe  heavie 
a  Censure  vppon  us  as  yf  we  alone  were  guiltie.  You  may  be  pleased  to 
Consider  what  instructions  you  haue  formerly  given  us,  to  wynn  the 
Indyans  to  us  by  A  kinde  entertayninge  them  in  ou"'  howses,  and  yf  it 
were  possible  to  Cohabitt  w""  us,  and  how  ympossible  it  is  for  any  watch 
and  warde  to  secure  us  against  secrett  Enemies  y*  live  pmiscouslie  amongst 
us,  and  are  harbored  in  our  bosomes,  all  Histories  and  your  owne  Dis- 
course may  Sufhcyently  informe  you. 

For  the  warninge  given  y"  last  yeere,  some  of  us  heere  cann  say  nothinge 
vnto  yt,  but  S':  George  yardley  and  m'  Pountis  them  selves  doe  affirme,

to  whose  memories  we  give  all  respect  &  honor,  but  yf  you  please  to  take

The  maine  Cause  why  retournes  were  not  made  for  y'=  last  yeers

For  gatheringe  of  Sasafras,  although  the  necessitie  of  the  ycre  ^  doth  require

But  of  all  that  came  ouer  w"'  him  I  haue  sent  you  here  inclosed  a  list  of 
theire  names  and  how  they  are  disposed  of.  I  haue  receaued  your  booke 
of  debts;  in  the  gatherings  whereof  there  shall  be  noe  fault  in  my  indeauor: 
although  I  am  affraid  there  bee  little  Tobacco  left  w'*'  the  Magazin  hath 
not  receaued,  or  the  marchants  &  seamen  not  gleaned  for  theire  sackes  & 
stronge  waters.  60000  waight  beinge  the  most  y'  this  yeares  crop  hath 
produced.  As  for  y"  Deuty  Boyes,  they  thinke  much  to  be  brought  to  a 
backe  reconinge:  since  they  paid  as  much  as  was  demaunded  for  the  & 
receaued  acquitances.  Yet  S'  George  Yardly  will  pay  the  ouerplus  for 
those  w'''  he  reserued  to  himselfe:  the  like  offer  was  made  by  Capt.  Wittm 
Powell  (who  is  now  w*''  God)  but  y*  they  are  not  able  at  this  time  to  dis- 
charge it.  S'  George  complaines  not  w*''out  cause  who  I  beleiue  hath  lost 
this  yeare  two  thirdes  of  his  estate:  &  to  giue  him  his  dew  he  hath  behaued 
himselfe  very  nobly  in  y"  seruice  of  y"  Country  to  his  great  expenses.  But 
what  I  can  I  will  doe  &  send  you  the  accomptes  by  the  Abigail. 

Concerninge  y"  Shipwrights  (y"  best  proiecte  for  y''  Country  &  most

wherein,  if  you  blame  vs,  you  must  blame  the  hand  of  God,  that  hath  taken 
away  Capt:  Barwicke  &  6  or  7  of  his  principall  §worke§  men.  A  hard  man, 
yet  not  a  little  toutched  in  conscience  that  he  hath  conuerted  the  releif  of 
his  men  to  his  particular  benefit:  But  out  of  y*  w''''  is  his  (whereof  I  haue 
[3]  made  a  stay)  satisfaction  vppon  proofe  shalbe  giuen.  Those  y'  remaine 
shall  imploy  theire  time  to  your  best  aduantage. 

The  ill  successe  of  y"  glasse  workes  is  allmost  equall  vnto  this:  first  the 
coueringe  of  y''  house,  ere  fully  finished,  was  blowne  downe,  by  a  tempest 
noe  sooner  repaired  but  y*"  Indians  came  vppon  vs,  w"'"  for  a  while  deferd

rccoueriiigc  in  y*"  begiiiniiige  of  }'"  winter,  I  hyred  some  men  for  }•'  seruico, 
assisted  the  w"'  mine  owne,  rebuilt  the  furnace,  ingaged  mj^  selfe  for 
prouisions  for  them,  &  was  in  a  maim''  a  seruant  vnto  them.  The  fier 
hath  now  beene  six  weekes  in  y**  furnace,  and  yett  nothinge  effected.  They 
complaine  y*y'' sand  will  not  run.  (though  themselues  made  choise  thereof, 
and  likt  it  then  well  enought)  &  now  I  am  sendinge  vp  y'=  riuer  to  prouide 
the  w"'  better,  if  it  bee  to  bee  had.  but  I  conceaue  that  they  would  gladly 
make  the  worke  to  appeare  vnfeasable,  y'  they  might  by  y*  meanes  be 
dismissed  for  England.  Much  hath  beene  my  truble  herein,  and  not  a 
little  my  patience  (f  haueinge  beene  called  rascall  to  my  face  for  reprouinge 
them  of  theire  ryot,  negligence  &  dissension)  but,  for  the  debt  w''''  I  ajn  in, 
for  theire  sustentation  I  hope  y"  aduenturers  will  see  it  discharged. 

The  silkewormeseede  y'  came  in  these  last  shipps,  are  well  conditioned  for 
the  most  pt.  I  haue  deliuered  them  to  y"  Frenchmen  least  they  might 
miscarry  out  of  our  want  of  skill:  but  when  y"  [4]  time  of  the  yeare  shall 
come,  I  will  distribute  of  them  to  such  as  haue  the  most  desire  &  the  best 
meanes  to  cherish  them.  Many  Mulbery  trees  the  last  yeare  were  planted, 
&  many  vines;  but  the  later  came  to  nothinge  out  of  y"  trouble  of  y''  times, 
or  want  of  art  &  perhaps  y"  badness  of  y''  cuttings:  for  they  all  grow  on 
old  stocks,  and  are  yearely  burnt  downe  by  y"  firyinge  of  y''  woods:  but  tlie 
neglect  of  tendinge  them  I  beleiue  is  y*"  cheife.  Wherefore  now  wee  haue 
taken  an  other  order;  that  every  plantation,  (who  are  bonde  vnto  it  by 
indenture)  shall  im])lw§ale§  two  acres  of  grounde,  and  imploy  the  sole 
labor  of  2  men  in  y'  busines,  for  y'^  terme  of  7  yeares  enlarginge  y"  same  2 
acres  more,  w**"  a  like  increase  of  labore:  in  w'=''  they  are  to  build  a  large  ste 
house  of  2  storyes,  well  seiled,  for  silkewormes.  by  this  meanes  I  hoj^e 
this  worke  will  goe  really  forwarde,  &  y-  better  if  good  store  of  Spanish  or 
French  vines,  may  be  sent  vs. 

I  haue  hired  a  shi})  to  cary  y^  Colledge  men  to  theire  plantation,  w'=''  is 
now  vnder  sayle,  I  pray  god  it  succeede  well;  but  I  like  not  this  strage- 
linge:  &  if  all  had  beene  of  my  minde,  I  would  rather  haue  disobaj^ed 
your  comaunds,  then  subiected  y*"  Collony  to  such  disorder  and  hazards. 
Vuv  how  is  it  possible  to  gouerne  a  people  so  dispersed;  especially  such  as 
for  y''  most  part  are  sent  ouer?  how  can  they  repaire  to  diuine  seruice, 
except  euer}'  plantation  haue  a  Minister?  how  caji  wee  raise  soldiers  to

one  anothers  labors,  &  giuen  both  strength  and  beuty  to  y"  Collony  &

there  in  y',  when  phaps  10  of  60  will  not  stand  to  theire  health  [5]  and  a 
nimiber  of  them  dye?  whereof  this  yeare  wee  haue  had  a  miserable 
experience.  The  other  day  a  party  went  vp  to  seat  on  y"  Kinge  of  Apo- 
matuckes  townes,  but  before  they  could  get  thither,  they  were  soe  de- 
minished  by  death,  and  weakened  by  sickenes,  that  they  were  fayne  to 
giue  it  ouer.  Such  a  pestilent  feuer  rageth  this  winter  amongst  vs:  neuer 
knowne  before  in  Virginia,  by  the  infected  people  y*  came  ouer  in  y^ 
Abigail,  who  were  poisened  w"'  stinkinge  bere  all  fallinge  sike  &  many

Surlier  hath  bene  alsoe  deadly  vnto  vs;  I  for  my  part,  haueinge  lost  19 
by  sickenes  &  4  by  y**  Indians.  You  may  ges  in  what  a  pore  condition 
I  am,  but  the  extreame  sickenesse  I  haue  sufferde,  the  heart-brcakinge  to

Propositions  considerable  for  the  equall  managinge  of  the  Conti-act  \\ith 
his  Majestie  concerninge  the  sole  uuportacion  of  Toljacco  graunted  to  the 
twoe  Companies  of  Virginia  and  the  Sumer  Islands. 

1.  First  that  the  agentes  whoe  undertake  the  mannageinge  of  this  busines 
and  are  to  be  payd  for  their  laljour,  doe  give  good  securityc  to  free  the 
companyes  and  the  goodes  of  every  jwrticuler  adventurer  from  that 
Covenant  with  his  Majestie  for  bringiiige  in  of  S0,000  weight  of  X'arimis 
tobaccoe  in  three  yeares  inasmuch  as  not  the  companyes  but  thcnisolves 
that  underwright  the  vSpanish  stocke  shall  have  the  benefit  thereof. 

2.  What  satisfaction  they  will  give  to  the  Virginia  Planters  or  to  our 
Sumer  Islandes  Tenantes  for  their  Tobaccoe,  which  they  shall  send  or 
bringe  hither  for  price  and  payment. 

3.  What  ordinary  rate  they  will  impose  upon  the  Sumer  Islandes  Tobaccoe 
for  defrayinge  the  25  C.  li.  salery  and  what  rate  in  such  accidentall  cases

as  may  fall  out  namely  if  noe  Spanish  tobacco  (or  but  little)  shall  be  brought 
in,  or  that  the  greatest  part  of  Virginia  shall  be  directed  to  other  partes, 
or  in  case  the  Sumer  Islandes  tobacco  when  it  cometh  shall  be  all  sould 
together,  or  the  kinge's  parte  only,  by  the  candle  without  anie  charge  or 
labour  of  theirs. 

4.  What  order  they  will  take  to  free  the  Adventurers  of  disbursments  for 
custome  fraight  and  publique  charges  before  they  take  our  goodes  unto 
their  possession. 

5.  What  securitie  they  will  give  to  performe  the  premisses  and  to  give  a 
just  accompt  of  the  sales  and  of  the  proceed  thereof  to  his  Majestic  and  to 
thadventurers,  and  when  to  make  payment. 

6.  For  that  the  contracte  is  but  conditionally  agreed  upon  in  Courte  to 
contynue  if  the  proclamacion  shall  be  published  by  Midsomer  next,  whoe 
shall  (when  the  contracte  fayleth)  defray  the  great  Rent  of  IGO  /.  per 
annum  for  the  directors  great  house  intended  to  be  taken  and  the  greate 
saleryes,  howe  and  in  what  proporcion  and  howe  shall  his  Majestie  then 
have  his  due  and  every  man  his  owne  proper  goodes  delivered  backe 
againe. 

7.  To  explayne  themselves  whether  out  of  25  C.  I.  salery  (whereof  they 
say  his  Majestie  is  to  pay  a  third  parte)  they  meane  to  defray  all  charges 
or  whether  they  intend  to  put  to  accompt  over  and  above  the  Charges  of 
Porters,  Carrmen,  Coopers,  Wharfage  Waiters,  Searchers,  suites  of  lawe, 
shrinckinge  in  weight,  desperate  debtes  and  such  like. 

8.  As  the  greate  cjuantitie  and  meane  condicion  of  the  Virginia  and  Sumer 
Islandes  tobacco  is  not  fittinge  for  the  vent  and  expcnce  of  this  kingdome, 
but  for  the  most  at  easy  rates  must  be  exported,  soe  the  greate  enhance- 
ment of  price  by  thirds  taken  out  and  excessive  charges  put  upon  will 
make  it  altogether  un possible  to  be  exported  and  therefore  to  be  con- 
sidred  howe  to  cleare  this  difficulty  soe  that  profitt  may  come  to  thadven- 
turers and  Planters. 

9.  The  sallery  men  for  the  most  parte  to  be  excepted  against  some  of  them 
for  want  of  skill,  some  want  of  estate,  some  of  them  noe  way  interessed, 
and  other  contynually  maynteyninge  and  raysinge  quarrells  and  bitter

CC'LXXXIX.  Answer  to  the  Foregoing  Propositions  ^ 

March  (?),  1623 

Papers  of  Lord  Sackville,  No.  01(37 
Document  at  Knole  Park,  Kent 

An  Aunsweare  to  the  Projiositioiis  exhil)ited  to  tlie  Right  llon'ble  tlic 
Lord  High  Treasuror  of  England  for  tlie  cciuall  menaginge  of  the  Contract 
with  his  Majestie  concerninge  the  sole  Importation  of  Tobacco  etc. 

It  is  first  to  be  observed,  that  the  Contract  hath  beene  ratified  by 
Six  Quarter  Courts;  vizt.  three  of  each  Companie:  noe  one  man  at  the 
question  declaring  his  dissent,  save  onely  the  Deputy,  and  that  in  the 
first  Court  onei\'. 

It  is  also  to  be  observed  that  the  Raysers  of  troubles  in  the  Courts 
namely  Mr.  Wrote  and  his  abettors,  though  their  pretences  have  beene 
agaynst  the  Sallaries  and  the  mannor  of  Imiwrtacion  of  Spanish  Tobacco: 
yet  in  the  heate  of  their  opposicions,  their  speeches  and  reasons  have 
allwayes  reflected  upon  the  body  of  the  Contract  itselfe,  which  being 
contrari(>  to  all  older  hath  mucli  distasted  the  Companies. 

Ami  it  is  nowe  to  be  observed  that  these  Propounders  though  their 
l)retence  in  their  wrighting  be  for  the  equall  menaginge  of  the  Contract, 
And  although  they  have  often  in  the  courts  very  solemnly  protested  and 
vowed,  that  they  were  not  against  the  Contract  itselfe,  yet  when  they 
came  before  the  Lord  Treasuror,  they  dismasked  themselves,  and  unani- 
mously professed  that  they  were  agahist  the  very  body  of  the  contract: 
which  sheweth,  that  these  Articles  can  be  noe  other  then  Cavills,  seeing 
their  i)retence  is  one  way,  and  their  uitent  another  way. 

iViid  before  wee  come  to  the  answering  of  the  perticuler  Articles,  wee 
are  inforced  to  take  excepcions  unto  the  manner  of  propounding  them.

MARCH  (?),  1623  33 

For  it  is  necessarie  to  be  knowne,  that  the  Coiuiseil,  Coinittees  and  Com- 
panies having  first  concluded  on  the  OflSces  necessarie  for  the  menacing 
of  this  Contract,  as  also  of  their  rewardes  by  way  of  Sallarie  (according 
to  the  fifte  Article  of  the  Contract):  The  Officers  themselves  were  lastly 
chosen  in  botli  the  Courts:  and  the  burthen  was  imposed  upon  the  chiefe 
of  them,  in  a  free  and  unanimous  eleccion,  contrary  to  their  most  earnest 
and  often  iterated  desires. 

It  is  also  further  to  be  knowne,  that  by  reason  of  these  troubles, 
both  the  chiefe  Officers  and  divers  of  the  Comittees  having  voluntarily 
surrendred  their  places,  and  greatly  importuned  the  Courts,  to  accept 
of  tlieir  Surrenders;  yet  the  same  have  beene  refused,  and  they  continued 
in  their  offices,  much  contrary  to  their  wills,  and  most  earnest  suits, 
whereas  contrariwise  these  Articles  are  propounded  in  that  manner,  as 
though  the  Officers  had  bin  ambitious  of  this  imployment,  and  cojise- 
quently  were  to  undertake  it  with  all  indignities.  Then  which  noething 
can  be  more  untrue  and  unjust. 

1.  To  the  first  Article  it  is  answered,  that  the  matter  therein  conteyned 
is  allready  regulated  in  the  Quarter  Courts  of  bothe  the  Companies. 
And  that  the  Officers  or  Agents  of  the  companies  have  noe  more  to  doe 
in  the  bringing  in  of  the  Varinaes  Tobacco,  then  any  other  perticuler 
member  that  liste  to  adventure  his  stock  therein:  By  which  order  of  the 
said  Quarter  Courts,  it  is  declared  that  the  perticuler  Adventurers  for 
the  said  Varinaes  Tobacco  are  to  bring  in  the  proporcion  expressed  by 
the  Contract:  the  Bodies  of  the  Companies  bearing  a  tenth  part  with 
them.  But  in  case  of  any  misfortune  by  losse  of  their  Tobacco  without 
the  default  of  the  said  Adventurers,  they  are  not  to  be  farther  charged 
also  with  restitucion  or  recompence:  but  the  same  is  to  rest  upon  the 
whole  body  of  the  Companies,  and  consecjuently  to  be  answered  out  of 
the  Companies  publique  Stocks:  and  if  these  should  not  suffice,  then  out 
of  the  Stocks  of  the  Generall  Adventurers  returned  from  the  Plantations, 
as  heretofore  in  like  cases  had  beene  usually  done. 

2.  In  the  second  Article,  the  Question  is  likewise  resolved  I)y  bothe  the 
Quarter  Courts;  vizt.  that  generally  the  Adventurers  and  Planters,  both 
for  price  and  payment,  are  to  goe  in  equall  lines:  Neither  of  which  are  to 
be  ordered  or  concluded  by  the  officers,  but  by  the  Generall  Courts  them- 


34  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

selves;  the  matter  being  first  seriously  debated  and  prepared  by  the 
Coniittees.  And  in  favour  of  the  poorer  sorte  of  Planters,  there  have 
beene  divers  other  wayes  devised  and  resolved  upon,  by  the  generall 
consent  of  bothe  the  Courts;  both  for  the  advancing  of  their  prices,  and 
expediting  of  their  pajanents. 

3.  To  the  third  Article  it  is  answered,  that  it  is  grounded  wholy  upon 
errors.  An  error  it  is,  to  conceave  that  the  rating  of  charges,  is  in  the 
power  of  the  Officers:  being  reserved  (as  all  other  important  matters)  to 
the  Generall  Courts.  An  error  it  is,  to  thinke,  that  the  labour  of  the 
Officers,  consisteth  wholy  or  chiefly  m  the  matter  of  Sale:  the  well  men- 
aging  of  the  Contract  extending  itselfe  in  the  difficulties  thereof  to  a 
much  larger  Compasse.  And  lastly  it  is  an  error  and  misinformacion, 
to  say  that  the  Salaries  amount  unto  five  and  twenty  hundred  poundcs: 
whereas  they  come  but  to  Seaventeene  hundred  poundes.  But  to  the 
matter  itselfe  of  this  article,  the  answere  is  not  difficult.  For  the  charges 
to  be  imposed  wilbe  lighter  or  heavier  according  to  the  proporcion  greater 
or  lesser  of  Tobacco  to  be  brought  in,  and  that  with  this  comfort  both  to 
Adventurers  and  Planters  that  the  greatnes  of  the  cjuantity  will  diminishe 
the  perticuler  charge;  and  the  smallnes  of  the  quantity  will  enhance  the 
generall  price. 

But  whereas  there  is  mencion  made  of  the  selhng  the  Tobacco  together, 
it  is  to  be  observed  that  the  course  thereof  lately  jjropounded,  by  these 
Objectors,  is  subject  to  Fraude  and  much  wrong  both  to  the  Kinge 
and  Companies:  vizt.  that  certaine  Undertakers,  being  inembers  of  the 
Companies,  should  rayse  a  greate  Stock  in  money,  to  buy  of  all  the 
Tobacco  by  way  of  whole  Sale.  For  considering  the  courts  in  the  vaca- 
cions  are  often  times  very  thinne,  and  the  Somer  Ilandes  Court  by  the 
Letters  Pattents  may  consiste  of  Eighte  persons  onely:  these  Under- 
takers may  easily  attayne  to  be  the  greater  parte  of  the  Courts,  and  con- 
sequently may  be  both  Buyers  and  Sellers  at  the  same  time.  A  feare 
not  causeles,  but  grounded  on  former  experience;  whereby  some  of  these 
Objectors  have  made  themselves  rich,  by  the  great  losse  and  detriment 
of  the  Adventurers  and  Comjjanies. 


MARCH  (?),  162S  35 

To  the  4th  Article  the  answere  is,  that  the  Court  have  ahready  ordered 
that  the  Custome  and  freight  shalbe  discharged  by  the  Officers,  who  are 
to  be  secured  from  damage  by  the  goodes  in  their  custody. 

5.  To  the  5  article  it  is  likewise  answered  that  the  Courts  with  (Jenerall 
consent  (onely  one  dissenting)  have  taken  full  order  for  security  both  of 
goodes  and  money:  which  orders  have  beene  read  before  the  Lord  Treas- 
urer, and  wee  suppose  they  are  more  exquisite  for  caution  on  all  sides, 
then  are  used  in  anie  other  Company  whatsoever,  as  at  the  nuiking  of 
them  was  openly  acknowledged.  The  perticularities  whereof  are  to 
long  to  be  here  sett  downe:  but  are  ready  to  be  shewen  to  any  that  shall 
desire  to  see  them.  Whereunto  wee  may  add  a  strict  oath,  which  is  to 
be  administred  to  all  the  Officers  of  what  degree  soever,  for  just  and 
equall  dealing,  both  in  keeping,  preserving,  selling  and  accompting  for 
the  goodes;  as  also  in  making  the  paymnts  at  such  time  as  they  shall 
growe  due  wherein  the  Officers  also  from  time  to  time  are  to  be  directed 
by  the  Courts. 

6.  To  the  Sixte  Article,  it  is  answered,  that  by  vertue  of  the  Contract, 
the  Proclamation  mencioned  was  presently  to  come  forth.  But  upon 
mocion  from  the  Lord  Treasurer,  the  Companies  have  consented,  that 
it  may  be  forborne  till  the  Twentith  of  June:  at  which  time  the  Lord 
Treasurer  hath  promised  that  it  shalbe  published.  Of  the  performance 
of  whose  promise,  though  the  Propounder  here  seeme  to  make  soe  great 
doubt;  yet  the  Companies  will  make  none  at  all:  and  therefore  hold  it 
unfitt  to  follow  the  Propounders  stepps  any  further;  in  which  it  scemeth 
that  jealousy  hath  outrun  their  duety. 

7.  To  the  Seaventh  it  is  answered  that  the  Officers  are  to  be  accomptable 
for  all  charges,  if  five  and  twenty  hundreth  poundes  will  serve,  the  re- 
mayne  is  to  be  restored.  If  more  be  necessary,  that  which  wants  must 
agayne  be  leavied.  That  the  Officers  out  of  their  owne  estates,  should 
beare  those  uncertaine  burthens,  of  desperate  debts,  suits  in  lawe,  shrink- 
age and  the  like,  is  soe  farr  not  onely  from  Eciuitie,  but  from  all  ordinarie 
reason,  that  they  hope  the  Propounders  themselves  upon  better  consider- 
acion  will  retract  the  Question. 


36  EPTORDS  OF  THE  VIliGINIA  COMPANY 

8.  To  the  Eislitc  Article  it  is  answered,  that  tlie  case  of  nieane  Tobacco 
is  mueli  more  difficult  without  this  Contract,  then  with  or  under  it.  For 
the  Tweh-e  pence  on  the  pound  amounted  to  much  more  then  the  valine 
of  one  entire  halfe,  not  onely  of  the  meaner,  but  also  of  the  middle  sort 
thereof  as  experience  hath  shewed. 

9.  To  the  Ninth  Article,  which  layeth  aspersions  on  the  Officers'  persons, 
the  Answere  is  plaine.  The  two  chiefe  Officers  were  chosen  by  the  Ballat- 
ing  box  with  65  votes  for  them,  and  not  above  five  against  them.  The 
Eighte  Comittees  were  chosen  by  ereccion  of  handes  out  of  the  nomber  of 
Sbcteene,  named  by  the  Courts  to  stand  for  the  places:  In  which  nomber 
of  Sixteene,  were  divers  of  these  objectors.  The  Companies  made  choise 
of  them  whome  by  experience  they  knewe  to  love  the  Plantations,  and 
were  fitt  for  the  diversity  of  imployments  incident  to  this  busines:  some 
of  them  being  Merchantes,  some  Retaylors,  some  skilfull  in  the  Fortes, 
and  others  such  as  by  long  continuance  and  attendance  in  the  Courtes, 
were  skilfull  in  the  affaires  of  the  Companies  and  Flantacions  and  withall 
large  Adventurers.  Of  which  Eighte,  six  have  beene  yearely  chosen 
Comittees  and  Assistants  for  these  Three  yeares  last  past;  neither  any 
just  excepcion  can  be  taken  to  any  of  them  by  mindes  unpossessed  with 
partiallity  or  mallice,  neither  are  the  companies  to  be  l^lamed  in  this  or 
other  their  eleccions,  if  they  have  rather  made  choise  to  entrust  their 
Goodes  in  the  hands  of  men  untainted  for  integritie  and  honesty,  then  in 
theires,  whose  wisdome  hath  beene  for  their  owne  perticular  benefitt, 
who  in  their  former  menagements  of  Tobacco  have  reduced  Seaven  thow- 
sand  iioundes  sterling  to  Fower  thowsand  poundes,  and  who  never  yet 
gave  up  any  faire  account  of  the  Companie's  goodes.

It  was  my  promise  to  write,  as  I  remember,  and  you  desire  to  lieare  from 
me,  I  perswade  my  selfc  you  thinke  I  will  not  dissemble,  and  I  protest  you 
are  in  the  right:  Now  for  true  newes  thus  it  is,  the  Indians  are  drawne  of 
as  farre,  as  a  man  can  hurle  a  stone  at  twice,  I  make  no  question,  but  when 
the  leaves  are  greene,  they  wilbee  somewhat  nearer,  and  now  forsooth  they 
would  faine  have  peace,  Conditionallie,  that  they  may  haue  their  Corne

Corne  is  readie,  haue  at  yo''  bucklers  you  braue  §Cow— §  Englishmen.  I 
was  with  the  Goilnour  at  James  Cittie,  and  told  both  him,  and  the  Councell 
that  I  came  not  ou9  to  plant  Tobacco,  neither  for  my  owne  end^,  although 
the  Companie  was  at  no  Cost  with  me,  but  onelie  bare  passage,  neither 
was  I  beholding  to  them  for  ought  but  love,  yet  if  they  pleased  to  accept 
of  my  seruice  I  would  by  the  helpe  of  God,  and  a  few  handC  make  them 
wearie  of  their  lyues;  this  was  well  taken,  and  eu9ie  one  was  perswaded  I

myne,  I  Could  beleiue,  if  I  thought  it  were  possible  for  so  wise  a  man 
to  bee  blinded,  as  I  know  our  Gou9nour  is,  that  S'  George  had  throwne  a

you  know  amongst  most  men  the  old  Prou9b  is,  Charitye  first  beginnes  at

waight  of  Tobacco,  yea  and  what  shall  this  man  doe,  runne  after  the 
Indians?  soft,  I  haue  phaps  10,  perhaps  15,  perhaps  20  men  and  am  able 
to  secure  my  owne  Plantaron;  how  will  they  doe  that  are  fewer?  let  them 
first  be  Crusht  alitle,  and  then  perhaps  they  will  themselues  make  vp  the 
Nomber  for  their  owne  safetie.  Theis  I  doubt  are  the  Cogitaf-ons  of  some 
of  our  worthier  men.  If  ther  bee  anie  such,  I  would  God  had  their  soules,

Right  Wor"  this  is  to  lett  yow  vnderstand  tliat  I  am  in  a  most  miserable

before  vs  were  allmost  Pined,  and  then  they  fell  to  feedinge  soe  hard  of 
our  prouision  that  itt  killed  them  that  were  ould  Virginians  as  fast,  as 
the  scurvie  &  bloody  fluxe  did  kill  vs  new  Virginians:  for  they  were  in  such  a

that  they  haue  taken  doe  tell  vs  that  the  Indians  haue  15  aliue  w"'  them 
thus  through  theyr  Roguery  the  land  is  ruinated  and  spoyled,  and  itt  will 
not  bee  soe  stronge  againe  not  this  12  yeares,  for  att  our  Plantacon  of

at,'..e  and  now  re- thereof ,  he  conceaucd  this  to  be  most  meete;  (viz*)  That  the  Comp  haue 
diuers  yeares  since  erected  ffoure  Personage  §there§  (the  Hand  conteyning 
not  aboue  13000  Acres  of  Ground)  w"'  sufficient  meanes  to  entertayne

u' re  are  h^icroased  "0*  beene  fortunate  therein   §some  of  them  being  dead  &  other  some

^^*' Jii**^  *«^ Ministers  w*''  sufficient  &  competent  allowance;  one  of  w''''  it  hath  pleased 
God  to  take  out  of  this  world.     So  that  w"'in  w"'in  [l^]  these  Three  yeares 
Last  past  the  Company  hath  sent  well  and  sufficiently  prouided  &  fur- 
nished w*''  all  necessaryes  the  nomber  of  §at  least§  Seauen  Ministers. 

And  for  answere  to  the  second  part  thereof,  he  sayd  it  was  playne  (viz") 
that  the  Comp  hathe  allotted  to  euery  Minister  50  Acres  of  Gleabland 
&  beside  they  haue  appointed  &  ordered  that  after  §the  Land  shalbe 
planted§  there  shalbe  apportioned  to  them  out  of  the  fruits  of  tlu'  eartli

it  should  haue  bad  beene  made  more  playne  &  the  iust  some  specifyed 
of  the  Leauyes  that  haue  been  raysed,  &  therefore  thought  it  fitt,  that 
M'  EdwardC  should  be  called  to  an  Account;  for  it  seemes  that  the  Com- 
pany hath  not  pursed  it,  because  they  are  growne  so  farr  in  dett.  w*^*"

might  a  bring  a  true  ct  perfect  account  of  all  such  iniposicons  as  he  hath 
receaeud. 

Next  was  read  the  Third  Article,  being  this  here  following  viz' 

w'''  being  read,  some  conceaued  that  their  Comi)laint  in  this  Article  m 
§fe  be§  is  for  being  restrajaied  §&  del)ared§  of  their  liberty  &  fi'cedome 
contrary  to  the  Lawes  of  England  &  his  Ma**-'  tres  Pattent(^  graunted

as  in  their  printed  booke  of  Lawes  ^fifi  may  appeare.

A  Proposicon  for  aduancem*  of  His  Ma"'''  proffitt  and  good  of  the  Plan- 
tacons of  Virginia  and  the  Sumer  IlandC  by  setUng  the  trade  of  Tobacco, 
w^h  is  the  conioditie  by  w^h  they  now  cheifelie  subsist.* 

Ffirst  the  Plantacons  subsisting  as  yet  by  this  Comoditie  of  Tobacco  it  is 
necessarie  tliat  some  Prouision  be  made  that  the  sale  and  vent  thereof 
may  be  contynewed,  and  that  the  price  may  be  kept  vp  at  some  such 
proportionable  Rate  as  may  yeald  the  Aduenturers  and  Planters  reason- 
able proffitt 

And  as  it  is  necessarie  for  the  good  of  the  Plantacons  so  likewise  His  Ma*'"'^ 
proffitt  is  carefullie  to  be  regarded,  whose  casuall  Reuenew  by  this  Comod- 
itie hath  ben  increased  at  least  to  8  or  10  thowsand  pounds  p  An9:  and 
may  hereafter  be  much  more:  But  if  some  tymelie  Prouision  lie  not  made 
both  his  Ma*''''  Reuenew  wilbe  lost,  and  the  Plantacons  (especiallie  that 
of  the  SoiTier  Iland^)  in  danger  to  be  vtterlie  ruyned,  for 

1.  The  Quan title  of  Tobacco  (by  reason  of  the  late  excessiue  planting 
thereof  in  the  West  Indies  and  in  the  new  Plantacons  of  Guiana  and 
Brasil)  is  like  to  be  so  great  that  all  these  parts  of  Christendom  wilbe 
glutted  with  it,  and  the  price  of  Tobacco  brought  so  lowe  that  in  proba- 
bilitie  it  will  not  be  worth  so  much  a  pound  as  His  Ma""  hath  now  for 
Custome. 

2.  The  Tobacco  of  those  Countries,  though  not  in  wholesomnes  yet  in 
strength  astl  tast  and  estimacon  doth  so  farr  excell  ours  of  the  English 
Plantacons  that  if  in  His  Ma"""  dominions  we  can  not  find  sale  for  it,  our 
Tobacco  will  yeald  nothing  at  all.

Therefore  for  the  sethng  fee  and  aduancem*  both  of  His  Ma"''"  yearehe 
Reuenew  and  the  good  of  the  Plantacons  in  Virginia  and  the  Somer  Hands 
(w''h  are  amongst  many  others  most  memorable  works  of  His  Ma*'*"^  happie

Salt  in  France;  and  the  K:  of  Spaine  the  sole  Merchandize  both  of  Pepper 
and  euen  of  this  particular  comoditye  of  Tobacco  in  Spayne:  So  it  would 
please  his  most  Excellent  Ma*'**  our  Soueraigne  to  take  the  sole  preemption 
of  all  the  Tobacco  of  the  English  Plantations  in  Virginia  and  the  S:  Hands: 
allowing  the  Aduenturers  and  Planters  §within  some  conuenient  tyme 
after  they  shall  delyuer  it  at  y''  Port  of  London  §  2"  a  pound  for  the  worser 
sort  (so  y*  it  be  merchantable)  2"  6d  for  the  middle  sort,  and  3'  a  po:  for 
the  best:  cleare  of  charge  of  fraight,  Custome  and  Impost:  eftiy  ^fee  Ad- 
ucnturera  ftftd  Mftftt**s  te  [beare]  delyuer  thcyr  when  tt  sfe  This  will  giue 
full  and  uniuersall  content  to  the  Planters  and  Aduenturers,  who  must 
needs  acknowledge  it  a  worke  of  great  grace  and  princely  wisedom  in  his 
Ma*'"  so  to  prouide  for  them  that  they  shalbe  in  better  case  then  euer 
they  we[re.] 

[2]  And  for  securing  His  Ma*'"''  yearelie  fe  profiitt  it  may  be  managed  that 

ch'mE'^  will  '^rfot  *'^ome  able  men  may  be  conferrd  w'hall  who  will  become  the  King?  Mer- 
t:ike  so  great  a  chant?  for  this  Comoditie  and  allow  his  Ma''""  double  the  proporcon  w'h 
liuw'^irbe  man"  His  Ma"*"  payes  to  for  this  Tobacco:  so  that  the  ciuantitie  thereof  exceed 
r^.MuisYione™s^i^ot  400  thowsatid  weight,  w'^h  is  as  much  as  the  Plantations  wilbe  able  to 
Ma'i"  'v)euefitt^^°°''*^'  ^'^*^  thcsc  Kiugdomes  of  England  and  Ireland  vsuallie  vent.  Thus 
w'l'  will  much  in- -will  His  Ma"™  Rcuenew  by  this  CoiTioditie  be  raysed  to  fortie  if  not  fiftie 
king^'proffitt.     °  thowsaud  pouuds  p  Ah  certaine  and  his  Ma''"  not  one  penny  out  of  purse: 

And  for  incouragement  of  these  mchaunt?  it  is  propounded  that  they  may 
haue  the  sole  power  to  licence  the  Retayling  of  this  comodity:  And  then 
for  their  owne  securitie  they  may  agree  w'h  a  convenient  nomber  in  euery 
Citie,  Towne,  and  §greate§  pishe  to  buy  from  of  their  hand?  yearelie  a 
proporcon  of  this  Tobacco,  at  such  Rates  as  the  saied  mchants  may  be 
reasonable  gayners,  and  such  quantities  as  the  mchants  shalbe  sure  to 
haue  the  whole  coinoditie  taken  from  tlieiii  ;iiul  dispersed  into  many 
hand?,  and  this  is  very  feasible  if^[m]  for  if  none  may  §sell  or§  retaile 
§Tobacco§  but  such  as  shalbe  licensed  by  the  King?  mchant?  they  will 
find  rather  too  many  then  too  few  that  will  in  this  kind  dcale  w4i  them.

CCXCVII.  Reasons  offp:red  to  the  Privy  Council  against  Sir 
Edwin  Sandys's  Contract  and  Joint  Stock  for  the  Virginia  and 
SoMERS  Islands  Tobacco

List  of  Records  No.  424 

Sund§r§y  Reasons  against  the  Contract  and  Joynt  stocke  for  the  Virginia 
and  summer  Islands  Tobacco. 

1.  The  Contract  besides  Ciistome  and  charges  is  to  yeald  his  ma*'''  one 
third  part  of  the  good?  in  kind,  w'^h  third  part  (by  reason  the  Condiron 
of  this  yeares  Tobacco  falles  out  to  bee  meane  and  httleworth)  will 
disappoint  his  ma*'"  in  point  of  profit  And  the  other  two  thiixK  being  of 
like  bad  Condition  (all  charges  deducted)  there  wilbee  litle  or  nothing 
remayneing  for  the  Adventurers  and  Planters 

2.  The  greate  quantitie  and  meane  Condition  of  the  Virginia  and  summer 
IslandC  Tobacco  is  such  as  for  the  most  parte  it  must  bee  exported  at  easie 
rates  into  Turkie  Barbaric  and  other  forreine  part<  Which  by  the  charge 
of  this  Contract  is  impossible  without  great  damage  and  losse  to  the  owners. 

3.  The  heauie  charge  laid  vpon  Tobacco  by  this  Contract  will  occasion 
the  transportacon  thereof  from  the  Plantaeons  into  forreine  part^  and  not 
into  Englande,  whereby  his  ma''"  wilbe  a  great  looser  and  the  Companie 
much  damnified  nay  it  is  to  bee  feared  that  the  people  in  the  summer 
Islands  will  growe  altogeather  idle  haueing  nothing  else  to  raise  profit  by 
and  then  povertie  and  want  may  driue  them  to  revolte  and  so  his  ma*'" 
loose  the  strongest  knowne  forte  in  §the§  Christiandome  world  tending 
both  to  the  safetie  of  this  kingdome  and  acquisition  of  that  other  of  Vir- 
ginia to  the  wch  it  serues  instead  of  an  impregnable  forte

4.  No  such  Contract  as  this  can  bee  made  but  by  the  Joynt  Consent  of 
all  the  Adventurers  and  Planters  whereof  not  one  of  ten  haue  giuen  their 
[2]  Consent  and  manie  of  those  that  consented  conceiued  themselues 
inforct  vnto  it  but  being  since  better  acquainted  with  his  ma'^  most  free 
and  gracious  intencon  doe  now  humblie  declare  their  disassent  therevnto 
conceiveing  that  tliis  Contract  cannot  be  proceeded  in  without  extreame 
Iniustice  and  forfeiture  of  our  Charters  by  wch  wee  are  to  governe  our 
affaires  according  to  the  Lawes  of  England  that  doe  not  allow  the  good 
Subiect  to  bee  dispossessed  of  his  good^  without  his  Consent  And  wee  doe 
humblie  pray  that  the  Act  of  a  fewe  and  such  as  are  least  interessed  in 
point  of  charge,  and  therefore  doe  not  feele  the  waight  of  the  burthen 
w'h  they  lay  vpon  other  men  may  not  preiudice  the  whole  Companie. 

5.  The  rate  for  exporteing  of  people  to  the  Plantation  was  wont  to  bee 
fine  or  sixe  pound  a  head  to  bee  paid  in  Tobacco  but  by  this  Contract  the 
rate  will  growe  to  bee  ten  or  twelue  pound  at  least ;  the  owners  forecasting 
that  the  Tobacco  wii  they  shall  take  for  freight  of  the  Passengers  wilbee 
more  then  twice  dearer  vnto  them  §then§  in  former  times  And  soe  by  that 
meanes  will  extreamelie  hinder  the  Peopleing  of  the  Plantations  when 
passengers  cannot  but  at  such  extreame  rates  bee  transported  thither 

6.  The  sole  importaf-on  of  Sj^inish  Tobacco  is  a  jiart  and  cheife  Considera- 
tion of  this  C'ontract  by  which  importaron  not  the  Companies  but  jiriuatc 
men  that  make  the  stocke  shall  receiue  the  bcnifit;  And  therefore  [3]  noe 
cause  why  in  that  respect  the  good^  of  the  Adventurers  and  Planters 
should  bee  charged  by  this  contracte. 

7.  It  is  a  thing  of  great  daunger  and  hazard  for  particuler  mens  estates 
to  bee  ingaged  to  his  Ma''""  by  the  seales  of  the  Companie  for  the  per- 
formance of  so  great  a  Contract  w"li  may  breede  questions  and  lie  as  a 
perpetuall  charge  and  Incumbrance  vpon  the  persons  goodC  and  land^ 
of  them  and  their  heyres  that  are  free  of  the  said  Companies  yea  althougli 
they  neuer  receiued  one  pennie  benifit  by  their  frcedome. 

8.  A  single  Planter  doth  raise  at  tlie  most  but  30  pound  wight  of  To- 
bacco in  the  Summer  Islands  in  one  ycarc  for  his  owne  part  whereof  one 
third  by  the  Contract  is  to  goe  to  his  notlicr  third  ima"%  an  ordinarie 
charges  besides  Salary,  and  so  rest^  scarce  ten  pound  wight  to  the  poore 


MARCH  20,  162213  55 


Labourer  not  worth  in  all  aboue  one  pound  fine  shillings  for  his  whole 
yeares  paines  and  euen  out  of  this  25'  being  the  labour  of  the  whole  yeare 
hee  is  by  the  Contract  to  allowe  double  salarie  wch  may  take  away  all 
the  rest  and  leaue  him  nothing  at  all;  And  the  Adventurers  are  in  the 
same  case  soe  as  appareantlie  the  plantacon  wilbee  ouerthrowne  if  this 
Contract  doe  proceede. 

Neither  Will  the  monopolizcing  of  Tobacco  into  one  hand  anie  waies 
better  this  bargaine  but  rather  make  it  worse  for 

1.  If  by  that  meanes  they  suppose  to  raise  the  price  and  to  sell  it  dearer 
that  wilbe  the  next  way  to  cause  such  an  importacon  by  stealth  (as  was 
seene  in  peppar  when  the  like  course  was  taken)  as  that  owr  Tobacco 
will  lie  vnvented  till  it  rott  and  perish,  and  the  charge  of  keepeing  §the§ 
Porte  to  prevent  it  wilbee  in  likelihood  more  then  the  good€  are  Worth. 

[4]  2.  It  were  a  dangerous  President  and  neuer  heard  of  that  pluralitie 
of  voices  should  conclude  the  good^  of  other  men  without  their  Consent 
to  bee  put  into  a  Joynt  stocke  at  the  comeing  home  of  the  shipp  whereas 
the  Aduenture  outward  was  by  particuler  men  not  in  Joynt  stocke  wch 
if  it  shalbee  admitted  to  take  place  wilbee  the  vtter  ruyne  and  destruction 
of  all  trade  and  Commerce. 

3.  It  occasions  a  straunge  charge  of  a  yearelie  stipend  or  eS  Salarie  to 
Officers  to  mannage  this  Joynt  stocke  wch  the  Companies  are  not  able 
to  beare  and  yet  by  votes  of  such  as  are  least  interessed  and  of  those  men 
themselues  who  are  to  receiue  it,  was  caried  by  pluralitie  of  voices. 

4.  By  this  meanes  his  ma*'^  wilbee  charged  with  8  or  900''  per  Ann  cer- 
taine  for  his  third  part  of  this  salarie  and  how  much  more  Wee  know 
not  so  that  perhaps  his  ma*'^  charge  wilbee  more  then  his  whole  third 
part  of  this  meane  Tobacco  will  come  vnto. 

5.  It  hinders  the  poore  people  from  trucking  away  their  Tobacco  for 
Comodities  by  wch  heretofore  they  haue  releiued  themselues  and  made 
a  greater  benifit  then  euer  they  could  doe  by  selling  for  readie  money. 

6.  It  bereaues  both  Planters  and  Owners  of  present  meanes  to  supplie 
their  shares  seeing  they  must  attend  the  sale  and  Accompt  of  the  Joynt 
stocke.     It  subjects  them  to  great  hazard  by  ill  debtC 


56  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

8.  It  involues  them  in  intricate  AccomptC  and  is  like  to  occasion  infinite 
suit^  and  Contencons  and  will  breede  much  confusion  in  the  sale  of  their 
goodC  for  in  this  Comoditie  one  mans  parcell  of  Tobacco  is  much  better 
then  another  and  either  it  must  bee  sold  with  theires  of  lesse  value  and 
soe  a  losse  to  the  Owner  and  generall  discouragement  to  make  their  To- 
bacco good  or  else  if  euerie  mans  bee  kept  apart  wee  must  rest  [5]  vpon 
the  good  will  of  the  Agents  when  this  or  that  mans  parcell  shalbce  sold. 

9.  The  experience  of  the  losses  and  inconveniences  wch  haue  growne  by 
all  other  Joynt  stockes  is  sufficient  to  deterre  men  from  this  course  and 
wee  hope  his  Ma"''  will  not  permit  that  anie  man  she«M  §all§  bee  forced 
to  it  whether  hec  will  or  noe. 

Wee  conceive  this  buisines  wilbee  better  mannaged  if  it  will  please  his 
ma""  to  limit  the  Importacon  of  Spanish  Tobacco  to  a  reasonable  propor- 
con  as  alreadie  he  hath  done  and  to  graunt  the  farme  thereof  to  whom 
his  ma*'"  shall  please  for  his  owne  best  benifit  And  then  (reserueing  onelie 
that  proportion  of  Spanish  Tobacco)  to  inhibite  the  importacon  of  all 
other  saue  that  wch  shalbee  brought  in  from  theis  Plantacons,  and  that 
euerie  Aduenturer  and  planter  may  receiue  and  dispose  of  his  owne  goodC 
for  his  best  aduantage,  and  wee  shall  humblie  submit  o''selues  to  his 
ma**^  gracious  pleasure  for  such  a  Custome  to  bee  layd  vpon  owr  goodC 
as  may  incourage  all  the  Planters  and  Owners  to  import  all  the  Tobacco 
that  shalbee  made  both  in  Virginia  and  the  Summer  IsUukK  into  this 
Realme  of  England  and  not  otherwhere,  wch  as  it  would  increase  and 
aduance  the  plantacons  so  the  quantities  that  wilbee  brought  in  willx^e 
so  great  that  wee  conceiue  his  ma*^^  yearelie  profit  wilbee  much  greater 
this  way  then  the  other  how  specious  so  euer,  and  it  is  hoped  it  will  prosper 
much  better  because  it  wilbee  accompanied  with  the  willing  and  heartie 
affections  of  those  that  pay  it.  [6]  And  wee  humblie  pray  that  in  the 
layeing  on  of  tWs  this  Custome  his  ma""  will  haue  a  speciall  regard  to 
ease  the  Tol)acco  of  the  Summer  Islands. 

1.  Because^  it  is  a  place  of  great  importance  and  therefore  very  behoouefull 
to  giue  that  Colonic  content  and  to  provide  for  their  supplies. 

2.  This  poore  plantacon  hath  had  no  helpes  of  Lotteries  Collections  and 
other  Assistances  as  that  of  Virginia  hath  had 


MARCH  20,  1622IS  57 

3.  because  the  Tobacco  of  the  Summer  Islands  generallie  is  of  a  meaner 
sorte  then  that  of  Virginia  and  this  yeare  so  bad  that  it  is  Uttle  worth. 

4.  By  his  ma*^  Ires  patents  they  are  to  paye  but  5"  p  C.  for  all  Charges 
whatsoeuer. 

5.  Because  it  is  rather  a  forte  then  a  Country  able  to  produce  staple 
Comodityes  as  that  of  Virginia  and  so  hath  no  other  meanes  but  by  this 
poore  Weede  to  subsist 

6.  Because  those  of  the  Summer  Islands  Companie  that  are  to  beare  the 
burthen  of  this  charge  are  very  few  and  no  meanes  to  mantaine  the 
publique  charge  of  those  Islands  but  out  of  their  purses  wch  euery  yeare 
cost^  them  manie  thousand  pounds  and  yet  they  are  Comforted  with  the 
assureance  of  his  ma**^  gracious  respect  for  their  good  seruice  in  acquireing 
and  mantayneing  a  place  of  so  great  Consequence  without  anie  Charge  to 
his  ma*'*"  though  to  the  great  pliudice  and  vndooeing  of  some  of  their  owne 
particuler  fortunes  vnles  his  ma""  take  a  speciall  regard  of  them  ther  being 
twentie  of  them  that  at  least  are  out  of  their  purses  twentie  Thowsand 
pounds  in  this  Plantation.

Loveing  and  kind  father  and  mother  my  most  humble  duty  remembred 
to  you  hopcing  in  God  of  yo'  good  health,  as  I  my  selfe  am  t  at  the  makeing 
hereof,  this  is  to  let  you  vnderstand  that  I  yo'  Child  am  in  a  most  heavie 
Case  by  reason  of  the  nature  of  the  Country  is  such  that  it  Causeth  much 
sicknes,  as  the  scurvie  and  the  bloody  flix,  and  divers  other  diseases,  wch 
maketh  the  bodie  very  poore,  and  Weake,  and  when  wee  are  sicke  there 
is  nothing  to  Comfort  vs;  for  since  I  came  out  of  the  ship,  I  never  at  anie 
thing  but  pease,  and  loblollie  (that  is  water  gruell)  as  for  deare  or  venison 
I  never  saw  anie  since  I  came  into  this  land,  ther  is  indeed  some  foule,  but 
Wee  are  not  allowed  to  goe,  and  get  yt,  but  must  Worke  hard  both  earelie, 
and  late  for  a  messe  of  water  gruell,  and  a  mouthful!  of  bread,  and  beife, 
a  mouthfull  of  bread  for  a  pennie  loafe  must  serve  for  4  men  wch  is  most 
pitifull  if  you  did  knowe  as  much  as  I,  when  i^eople  crie  out  day,  and 
night,  Oh  that  they  were  in  England  without  their  lymbcs  and  would 
not  care  to  loose  anie  lymbe  to  bee  in  England  againe,  yea  though  they 
beg  from  doore  to  doore,  for  wee  live  in  feare  of  the  Enimy  eu9ie  hower, 
yet  wee  haue  had  a  Combate  with  them  on  the  Sunday  before  Shrovetyde, 
and  wee  tooke  two  alive,  and  make  slaves  of  them,  but  it  was  by  pollicie, 
for  wee  are  in  great  danger,  for  o'  Plantacon  is  very  weake,  by  reason  of 
the  dearth,  and  sicknes,  of  o'  Companie,  for  wee  came  but  Twentie  for  the 
marchaunt?,  and  they  are  halfe  dead  Just;  and  wee  looke  everie  hower 
When  two  more  should  goe,  yet  there  came  some  for  other  men  yet  to 
lyve  with  vs,  of  which  ther  is  but  one  alive,  and  our  Leiften^nt  is  dead, 
and  his  ffather,  and  his  brother,  and  there  was  some  5  or  6  of  the  last 
yeares  20  of  wch  there  is  but  3  left,  so  that  wee  are  faine  to  get  other  men 
to  plant  with  vs,  and  yet  wee  are  but  32  to  fight  against  3000  if  they 
should  Come,  and  the  nighest  helpe  that  Wee  haue  is  ten  miles  of  vs,  and 
when  the  rogues  ou9came  this  place  last,  they  slew  80  Persons  how  then 
shall  wee  doe  for  wee  lye  even  in  their  teeth,  they  may  easilie  take  vs  but

that  God  is  mercifull,  and  can  save  with  few  as  well  as  with  many;  as  he 
shewed  to  Gylead  and  like  Gilead^  Souldiers  if  they  lapt  water,  wee 
drinkee  water  wch  is  but  Weake,  and  I  haue  nothing  to  Comfort  me,  nor 
ther  is  nothing  to  be  gotten  here  but  sicknes,  and  death,  except  that  one 
had  money  to  lay  out  in  some  thinges  for  profit;  But  I  haue  nothing  at  all, 
no  not  a  shirt  to  my  backe,  but  two  Ragges  [2]  nor  no  Clothes,  but  one 
poore  suite,  nor  but  one  paire  of  shooes,  but  one  paire  of  stockins,  but  one 
Capp,  but  two  band^,  my  Cloke  is  stollen  by  one  of  my  owne  fellowes,  and 
to  his  dying  hower  would  not  tell  mee  what  he  did  with  it  but  some  of  my 
fellows  saw  him  have  butter  and  beife  out  of  a  ship,  wch  my  Cloke  I 
doubt  paid  for,  so  that  I  have  not  a  penny,  nor  a  a  penny  Worth  to  helpe 
me  to  either  spice,  or  sugar,  or  strong  Waters,  without  the  wch  one  cannot 
lyue  here,  for  as  strong  beare  in  England  doth  fatten  and  strengthen  them 
so  water  here  doth  wash  and  weaken  theis  here,  onelie  keepe  life  and  soule 
togeather.  but  I  am  not  halfe  a  quarter  so  strong  as  I  was  in  England, 
and  all  is  for  want  of  victualls,  for  I  doe  protest  vnto  you,  that  I  haue  eaten 
more  in  day  at  home  then  I  haue  allowed  me  here  for  a  Weeke.  you  haue 
given  more  then  my  dayes  allowance  to  a  beggar  at  the  doore;  and  if  M' 
Jackson  had  not  releived  me,  I  should  bee  in  a  poore  Case,  but  he  like  a 
ffather  and  shee  like  a  loveing  mother  doth  still  helpe  me,  for  when  wee 
goe  vp  to  James  Towne  that  is  10  myles  of  vs,  there  he  all  the  ships  that 
Come  to  the  land,  and  there  they  must  deliver  their  goodC,  and  when  wee 
went  vp  to  Towne  as  it  may  bee  on  Moonedaye,  at  noone,  and  come  there 
by  night,  then  load  the  next  day  by  night  noone,  and  goe  home  in  the 
afternoone,  and  vnload,  and  then  away  againe  in  the  night,  and  bee  vp 
about  midnight,  then  if  it  rayned,  or  blowed  never  so  hard  wee  must  lye 
in  the  boate  on  the  water,  and  haue  nothing  but  ahtle  bread,  for  whenee 
wee  go  into  the  boate  wee  haue  a  loafe  allowed  to  two  men,  and  it  is  all  if 
we  staid  there  2  dayes,  wch  is  hard,  and  must  lye  all  that  while  in  the 
boate,  but  that  Goodman  Jackson  pityed  me  &  made  me  a  Cabbin  to  lye 
in  alwayes  when  I  come  vp,  and  he  would  giue  me  some  poore  JackC  home 
with  me  wch  Comforted  mee  more  then  pease,  or  water  gruell.  Oh  they 
bee  verie  godhe  folkes,  and  loue  me  verie  well,  and  will  doe  anie  thing  for 
me,  and  he  much  marvailed  that  you  would  send  me  a  servaunt  to  tlie 
Companie,  he  saith  I  had  beene  better  knockd  on  the  head,  and  Indeede 
so  I  fynd  it  now  to  my  greate  greife  and  miserie,  and  saith,  that  if  you  love

CoatC  of  male.  Powder,  shot  and  all  the  thinges  that  they  had  to  trade 
withall,  they  killed  the  Captaine,  and  Cut  of  his  head,  and  rowing  with 
the  taile  of  the  boat  formost  they  set  vp  a  pole  and  put  the  Captaines  head 
vpon  it,  and  so  rowed  home,  then  the  Deuill  set  them  on  againe,  so  that  they 
furnished  about  200  Canoes  with  aboue  1000  Indians,  and  came  and 
thought  to  [5]  haue  taken  the  shipp,  but  sheewas  too  quicke  for  them  wch 
thing  was  very  much  talked  of,  for  they  alwayes  feared  a  ship,  but  now  the 
Rogues  growe  verie  bold,  and  can  vse  peeces,  some  of  them,  as  well  or  better 
then  an  Englishman,  ffor  an  Indian  did  shoote  with  M"^  Charles  my  M" 
Kindsman  at  a  marke  of  white  paper,  and  hee  hit  it  at  the  first,  but  M'' 
Charles  Could  not  hit  it,  But  see  the  Enuie  of  theis  slaues,  for  when  they

fall  foule  of  theis  Rogues  and  get  some  Corne  from  them,  aboue  halfe  the 
land  will  surelie  be  starved,  for  they  had  no  Crop  last  yeare  by  reason  of 
theis  Rogues,  so  that  wee  haue  no  Corne  but  as  ships  do  releiue  vs,  nor  wee 
shall  hardlie  haue  anie  Crop  this  yeare,  and  Wee  are  as  like  to  perish  first

is  it  not  straunge  to  me  thinke  you?  but  What  will  it  bee  when  wee  shall  goe 
a  mo§n§eth  or  two  and  never  see  a  bit  of  bread,  as  my  M'  doth  sa}^  Wee

with  weeping  teares  I  beg  of  you  to  helpe  me.  O  that  you  did  see  may

they  had  had  anie  knowledge  of  the  purpose  of  the  Indians,  the  most  part 

Could  not  possiblie  haue  preuented  their  treacheries:   but  must  either 

haue  beene  beseiged  in  their  houses  (and  Consequentlie  famished)  or  Cut 

of  as  they  followed   their  labours.     Vpon   this  occasion  wee  drew  the 

remainder  Close  together,  whereby  they  might  haue  beene  the  better 

gou9ned,  and  haue  added  to  their  lyues  both  Comfort  and  securitie  presentlie 

wee  should  haue  begunne  to  fortifie  Townes,  to  haue  built  framed  houses, 

to  haue  planted  hortyardC  and  gardens  to  haue  inclosed  ground  for  o"' 

Cattle,  and  set  vpon  more  reall  Comodities,  by  wch  the  Collony  in  short 

time  would  haue  growne  strong,  beautiful,  pleasant  rich  and  reputable 

But  such  is  the  disposicon  of  those  ivho  glorie  in  their  unsedomes,  that  </te?/ lithe  dispirsiug  of 

will  rather  Justifie  and  proceed  in  their  Errors  then  to  suffer  a  supposed  dis-'very  pernicious|| 

grace  by  reformeing  them;  So  that  wee  are  Comaunded  to  suffer  eu9ie  man 

to  retourne  to  his  [2]  divident,  though  in  some  stronger  fashion  and  haue 

our  discrecons  and  Courages  Censured  for  doeing  that  w^h  they  should 

have  begunne  with,  Who  cleare  themselues  by  the  wronginge  of  others; 

obiecting  vnto  vs  their  Instructions,  whereof  vianie  are  infeasihle  and  the 

most  Inconvenient,  for  to  say  the  truth  they  knowe  nothing  of  Virginia,  nor 

will  beleiue  anie  thing  frorn  vs  that  is  not  answer  cable  to  their  former  Con- 

cepcons.     But  if  eifi  they  will  doe  anie  good  they  must  admit  of  our  In- 

formacons,  and  suffer  ther  Instruccojis,  for  the  most  part,  to  bee  rather 

advices  then  Commaund^.     Extreame  hath  beene  the  mortalitie  of  this 

yeare,  w^h  I  am  afraid  hath   dobled   the  Nomber   of  those  w'^h  were 

massacred;  yet  with  our  small  and  sicklie  forces  we  haue  discomforted 

the  Indians,  round  about  vs,  burnt  their  houses,  gathered  their  Corne 

and  slaine  not  a  few;  though  they  are  as  swift  as  Roebucks  and  not 

to  bee  destroyed  but  by  surprize  or  famine  they  now  beginne  to  desire  a 

peace,  and  after  the  restitucon  of  their  Prisoners,  for  whose  sakes  wee 'I'^i'*^'''""^ 

seeme  to  bee  inclineable  thereunto  and  will  trie  if  wee  can  make  them 

as  secure  as  wee  v^ere,  that  wee  may  follo%ve  their  example  in  destroying  them 

Although  in  particuler  I  haue  not  suffred  much  by  the  Indians,  yet  haue 

I  lost  by  sicknes  23  meft  of  my  small  Nomber  to  the  greate  diminucon  of 

my  meanes,  and  impaire  of  my  last  yeares  profit,  and  had  I  not  hired  in 

good  time  the  sixth  part  of  a  ship  (w^i  Cost  me  aboue  140''  for  my  share) 

I  and  the  rest  of  my  men  had  fearid  harcUie  [3]  escaped  the  perishing  by 

famyne.     ffor  all  theis  disasters  I  have  sent  home  as  much  as  will  pay  that

I  huinblie  crave  yo''  pardon  if  I  have  not  written  §vnto  you§  so  often  as 
you  expected,  and  my  dutie  bound  me:  presumeinge  that  the  Governour 
had  acquainted  you  with  whatsoeu9  was  worthie  your  knowledge:     We 
found  at  our  Comemg  over  the  Country  in  peace,  but  in  such  a  peace  as 
presaged  ruyne:     the  people  dispearsed  in  small  familyes,  farre  distant  one 
from  another,  and  like  the  foolish  Arcadians,  exposed  to  the  pray  of  who- 
soeu9  would  assaile  them,  yet  Could  wee  not  reforme  this  mischeife,  they 
haueing  PattentC  granted  from  the  Court  in  England  to  plant  wheresoeu9 
they  pleased   contrarie  to  all  order,  discipline,  and  Example:  but  how  well

writt  home  of  such  a  proposicon  and  named  the  Proposer  with  his  Argu-

stood  at  that  tyme  for  a  Cypher  whilest  they  stood  ripping  open  o""  gutts: 
Captaine  Newce  he  cutts  our  throate  on  the  other  side  and  he  letts  in 
th'  Indians,  and  that  while  the  other  prouides  to  kill  all  the  swyne  as  it 
were  of  sett  purpose  to  ou9throw  all:  and  who  must  make  this  good  againe? 
The  old  smoker  our  (I  know  not  how  to  terme  him  but)  Gouernor,  so  good 
so  carefull  mild.  Religious,  iust,  honest  that  I  protest  Ge4  I  thinke  God 
hath  sent  him  in  mercie  for  good  to  vs,  he  vndergoeth  all  your  cares  &  ours, 
and  I  feare  not  but  god  will  bless  him  in  all  his  pceeding^  but  who  must  be 
th'  Instrument  to  make  all  this  whole  againe?  Why  Capps:  all  voyces 
can  sett  him  forth  about  these  businesses:  But  who  must  pay  him  his 
hyer?  The  Contrey  is  poore  and  the  Companie  is  poore  and  Capps  is  poore 
already,  &  poorer  he  wilbe  if  he  follow  this  course.  Yo"  see  I  neu*?  had

[2]  S''  I  haue  here  taken  some  paynes  for  yo''  Instruction,  w'^h  if  yo"  will 
receaue  may  breed  much  health:  for  of  force  this  must  be  granted  that 
either  its  a  plague  from  heauen,  or  els  the  plague  from  those  great  Shipps 
so  pestered  w*h  men:  I  meane  the  death  of  all  those  men  that  haue  dyed  this 
Winter  and  before  a  little:  I  promised  yo"  to  write  in  folio  but  had  it  not 
ben  seed  tyme  I  would  haue  sent  it  in  folioru:  Ffor  Martyns  Hundred 
if  I  had  but  one  Body  more  I  would  haue  ben  there  to  haue  secured  them: 
The  Counsell  was  very  earnest  w*h  me  to  haue  comanded  there,  but  the 
greater  worke  must  be  before  the  lesser:  yet  I  will  see  them  now  &  then,  & 
be  often  on  their  Backes  for  their  guard.  I  pray  good  S''  take  these  few 
Ijmes  and  puse  them  well  for  these  are  dangers  that  may  be  auoyded:  I 
meane  the  vnhealthines  at  Sea,  and  worse  when  it  comes  a  shoare 

The  first  cause  is  for  want  of  cleaneliness,  for  betwixt  the  decks  there  can 
hardlie  a  man  fetch  his  breath  by  reason  there  ariseth  such  a  ffunke  in  the 
night  that  it  causeth  putrifaction  of  bloud  &  breedeth  a  disease  much  like 
the  plague:  the  more  fall  sick  the  more  they  annoy  and  poyson  their  ffel-

lowes  the  w"h  may  be  preuented  by  care  had  by  yo":  Ffor  I  remember 
when  I  was  in  the  voyage  w4i  S'  Thorns  Gates  and  S'  George  Somers:  We 
canae  in  heate  of  Somer  &  were  at  sea  fifteene  Weekes  &  lost  not  a  man  and 
farr  southerlie  w"h  was  indeed  the  great  ra9cie  of  God,  &  the  meanes  of 
health  was  not  neglected,  w'^h  were  these:  By  that  tyme  we  had  layd  our 
owne  latitude  &  raysed  2  or  3  degrees  to  the  Southward  they  appointed  that 
euery  man  should  liaue  halfe  a  Biskett  Cake  and  halfe  a  small  Can  of  Beare 
euery  morning:  Then  were  appointed  swobbers  for  the  cleansing  of  the 
Orlopp  and  euery  part  of  the  Ship  below:  Then  euery  man  was  forced  in 
faire  Weather  to  bring  vp  his  Bed  to  ayre  in  the  shrowdes:  In  the  meane 
tyme  the  quarter  Masters  were  busied  in  the  swobbing  of  euery  caljbine 
belowe  w4i  Vinigar  as  also  betweene  Decks  w'^h  east  such  a  sauor  of  sharijnes 
to  the  Stomach  that  it  bred  health. 

Likewise  the  dogged  vsage  of  the  Saylers  I  meane  those  in  coiTiand  as 
namely  old  Tuke  fforteron  &  the  Purser  by  whose  means  I  dare  sweare  hath 
ben  the  death  of  halfe  the  Passengers  w'h  the  help  of  the  Poyson  they  gaue 
vs  instead  of  Beare:  And  for  my  owne  part  as  I  am  a  Christian  I  had 
no  allowance  at  all  nor  none  could  gett,  for  the  Purser  tould  me  my  Passage 
was  not  payd:  Therefore  by  my  consent  neu9  hire  Shipp  of  three  Decks 
for  they  of  force  must  breed  the  Sea  plague:  I  doe  not  meane  because  I 
had  no  allowance  but  by  reason  of  such  vehement  ffunkes  that  cometh 
from  below. 

Next  for  S''  W'"  Newce  he  came  indeed  into  the  Contrey  and  dyed;  &  M' 
Sandys  he  gripes  all  for  the  Companie  for  all  yo'  Order  of  Court:  and  if 
George  Sandys  yo"  looke  wcU  about  yo"  may  see  the  iust  hand  of  God  on  that  very  place: 
Ffor  by  true  Report  since  the  day  it  was  torne  from  vs,  there  haue  dyed 
aboue  a  hundred:  more  by  halfe  then  eu9  dyed  there  in  eleauen  yeare 
before,  and  one  himselfe:  Mum9.  And  now  if  the  Company  will  send 
me  ou9  x  or  xij  Carpenters  Sawyers  &  brickmakers  with  pulsion  for  the 
first  yeare  (I  will  [3]  take  paynes  &  care  to  prouidc  after  for  them)  and 
build  a  substantiall  guesthouse:  the  ferst  at  Elizabeth  &  the  other  at  James: 
ffor  if  yo"  did  but  see  how  miserable  they  dye  for  want  of  prouision  and 
housing  yo"  could  not  but  pittie  their  coses:  There  must  be  to  this  busi- 
ness two  yoake  of  Oxen  &  a  Horse  This  being  effected  by  gods  help  their

The  charge  against  S'  T.  Smith 

That  S''  T.  S.  hath  not  pformed  the  trust  reposed  in  him  by  His  Ma*'^ 
but  contrariwise  w*h  great  Reason  it  may  be  stronglie  presumed,  that 
both  he  first  came  to  vndertake  this  charge  w*h  sinister  &  priuate  endC 
of  his  owne  &  hath  so  contynued  therein  during  the  12  y.  of  his  gou9n'  w'^h  ^^!^l^^ 
seemeth  to  be  made  manifest  as  foUoweth. 

This  as  they  say  is  but  presumption:  And  contrarie  to  their  owne  Act  of '^"^^^• 
Court  when  S''  T.  S.  surrendered  his  place  in  w'^h  they  thankefuUy  acknowl- 
edged his  good  endeavo"  the  good  estat  of  the  plantacs  &  give  him  a 
reward  of  xx  shares:  8

2.  That  he  neglected  the  care  of  those  busmesses,  bec9  when  hee  satt  in  the 
Courts  he  would  many  tymes  rise  &  gee  about  intend  other  occasions:  &c 
Aiisw:  He  tooke  more  care  of  this  then  of  all  others  &  more  ingaged  himselfe. 

3:  He  sent  but  few  women  thither  &  those  corrupt. 
Ans.  Anijw  He  sent  a  great  many  &  those  of  the  best  hee  could  gett  &  some 
such  who3C  whose  Husband  since  hath  ben  knighted  &  made  Gouerno'' 
of  Virg. 

4:  He  sent  not  Cattle  sufficient  for  the  Colonye  &  all  of 
An8w.  He  sent  many  they  confess  300  in  their  declaracon. 

5  That  there  was  no  publiqe  scale  made  for  the  Company  in  S'  T.  S.  tyme: 
Nor  no  diuisions  of  land. 

A„s.  There  were  many  diuisions  of  land  made:  but  true  it  is  the  Colony  was 
not  so  scattered  as  since.  And  for  the  Seale  theft  that  w'^h  was  then  vsed 
was  the  Seale  made  for  the  Counsell  of  Virg  by  his  Ma"''  own  appointm*. 

6  That  though  there  were  ensamples  of  ii  staple  Comodityes  in  the  lO"" 
yeare  of  his  goun'  yet  in  the  12  y.  of  his  gou9n*  only  Tobacco  &  Sassafras. 

Answ.  There  hath  ben  none  at  all  since:  &  the  charg  is  vntrue. 

That  there  were  few  orders  &  lawes  made  in  S'  T.  S.  tyme  for  gou9m'  of 

the  Company  &  Colonye  from  whence  issued  Iniustice  a  pticular  instance 
Attf+w  whereof  that  men  were  sold  as  slaues  And  in  his  tyme  a  Comittee  appointotl 

to  consider  whither  it  were  fitt  to  contynue  &  desert  the  plantacon. 
Anau  [2]  There  were  lawes  for  the  Company  there.     And  none  for  the  Colony 

since  but  where  made  then. 

8  There  was  a  generall  neglect  in  his  officers:  M'  Caning  and  Alderman 
Johnson  who  neu9  cleared  his  Accompt  §but  wronged  the  Company  of 

AaewSOO"  in  fauor  of  the  Magazin.§  and  good^  bought  at  excessiue  Rate  And 
the  lists  of  mens  names  and  of  the  Ires  writt  to  &  from  Virginia  not  care- 
fully kept  And  that  Alderman  Johnson  in  a  discourse  of  his  to  a  priuate 
freind  did  discomend  the  Countrey.

9 No  fruite  of  tliexpence  of  the  tyme  &  money  in  generall

APRIL  (?),  1623  83 

Thus  much  for  neglects  in  S"'  T.  S.  tyme.     Now  for  3  matters  of  a  high 
nature. 

That  his  Ma*'''^  Instructions  first  giuen  for  gou9m'  were  not  obserued,  nori 
so  much  as  pubUshed. 

He  did  follow  thinstructions:  And  gaue  Coppies  tliereof  to  the  President  Answ. 
&  Counsell  first  established:  And  they  were  engrossed  fairely  in  a  Book 
as  a  Record. 

The  Counsell  seldome  assembled  but  w*h  the  Company,  and  the  LordC2 
§of  the  Counsell  §  made  little  acquainted  w'h  the  proceeding^  of  those 
businesses 

He  did  oft  assemble  them:  but  then  they  were  so  few  that  they  could  not  Answ. 
so  oft  as  he  would  as  had  be  meet:  And  he  conceaues  it  a  coiTiendation 
rather  then  an  error  §especially  an  offence  of  an  high  nature  §  that  in  all 
his  tyme  the  Lords  w  of  his  Ma*''"  Counsell  were  so  little  §trouble'^§  and 
their  more  weightie  affaires  interrupted  fey  the  bugino3!3c;3  ef  this  plantneon 
as  they  haue  ben  since  fey  §with§  these  businesses. 

That  Sir  T.  Smith  suffered  a  Booke  of  lawes  for  gou9m*  of  the  Colony  3 

cheifely  extracted  out  of  the  lawes  for  gou9ing  the  Aermye  in  the  low

sw.The  moneyes  he  receaued  of  the  Lotteryes  was  not  much:  for  he  left  in

May  it  please  you  to  understande,  yt  since  our  laste  Lre,  there  cam  two 
Indians  to  m[artins]  Hunndred,  who  accordinge  to  order  were  sent  vp  to 
James  Cyttie,  one  of  which  Called  (Chaueo)  who  had  lived  much  amost 
the  English,  and  by  revealinge  yt  pl[ot]  To  divers  vppon  the  day  of  Mas- 
sacre, saued  theire  lives,  was  sent  by  the  great  Kinge,  w""  a  messuage,  the 
ef!'ect  wherof  was  this,  that  blud  inough  had  already  been  shedd  one 
both  sides,  that  many  of  his  People  were  starued,  by  our  takinge  Away 
theire  Corne  and  burninge  theire  howses,  &  that  they  desired,  they  might 
be  suffred  to  plante  at  Pomunkie,  and  theire  former  Seatcs,  w*^''  yf  they 
might  Peaceablely  do  they  would  send  home  our  People  (beinge  aboute 
twenty)  whom  they  saued  alive  since  the  massacre,  and  would  suffer  us  to 
plant  quietly  alsoe  in  all  places,  The  other  (called  Comahum)  an  Actor 
in  the  Massacre  at  Martins  Hundred,  beinge  agreat  man  and  not  sent  by 
the  greate  Kinge,  Wee  putt  in  Chaines,  resolvinge  to  make  such  vse  of 
him,  as  the  tyme  shall  require.  The  Messenger  (beinge  dispatched  back, 
w*^  that  answere,  that  yf  Accordinge  to  theire  pmise,  they  would  send 
home  ou[r]  People,  they  should  quietly  sett  theire  Corne)  w*''in  A  weeke 
retorned,  w'*"  M'"s  [B]oyse  (the  Chiefe  of  the  prisoners)  sent  home  ap- 
pareled like  one  of  theire  Queens,  w''''  they  desired  wee  should  take  notice 
of).  The  reasone  why  the  rest  came  not,  was  because  Robert  Poole  (the 
Interpreter)  had  given  owte  threatinge  Speeches,  whom  tliey  desired  To 
haue  called  home  from  tradinge,  and  that  an  Englishman  should  be  sent 
to  tell  them  that  they  might  plant  theire  Corne  securely,  At  y"  messengers 
retorninge,  Robert  Poole  was  come  back,  but  we  haue  dispatched  the 
messenger  alone,  sufferinge  him  to  carry  Certen  beads  from  the  ffreends 
of  the  Prissoners,  w'=''  §by§  our  experience  of  their  Couetousne[ss]  (we

grow  secure  vppon  the  treatie,  we  shall  haue  the  better  Advantage  both 
to  surprise '  them,  &  to  cutt  downe  theire  Corne,  by  knowinge  where  they 
plant,  w"**  otherwise  they  will  plant  in  such  Corners,  as  §it§  will  nott  be 
possible  for  us  to  finnde  owte.

S^ 

I  beseech  you  to  hold  mee  excused,  y'  I  haue  not  wrot  ofener  to  you,  in 
my  Irs  to  S'  Edwin  Sandys,  who  comunicates  all  his  thoughts  w"'  you,  I 
haue  exprest  what  I  concieued  niateriall. 

I  vnderstand,  that  Capt9  Whitakers  charges  eight  of  the  Companies 
Tenants  vpon  my  accompt,  which  because  it  may  at  first  view  be  vnder- 
stood,  as  if  I  had  had  the  benefitt  of  them,  you  shall  know,  that  two  of 
them  being  Sawyers  and  parcell  Carpenters  namely  Greuett  and  Griffui 
were  entertained  imediately  before  the  Massacre  to  worke  about  the 
intended  Inne,  and  after  that  about  the  Palisadoes,  the  Court  of  guard 
&c  So  as  there  §is§  due  from  the  Corporacion  of  James  Citty  sLxe  score 
^^•'  of  Tobacco  from  them  both,  which  could  not  be  payd  this  yeare,  our 
Computacion  fell  so  short,  and  publique  dutie'  so  heauy:  W™  Smith  was 
allowed  for  my  guard,  as  one  of  the  thirty,  which  the  country  assigned 
mee:  John  Blisse  being  a  Smith  was  employed  in  his  trade,  but  the  other 
working  with  him  falling  sicke,  he  gott  little,  yet  at  next  cropp  you  shall 
recieue  ratably:  Roberts  was  hired  to  Gates,  and  Burland  to  Capt9 
Norton  by  their  Capt9  with  mj'  consent,  and  deserued  welt  their  wages: 
why  it  liatli  not  beene  gathered  in  was  not  my  fault:  Swartbrick  kept 
my  Cat  tell  and  Capt9  W"  Powells,  for  which  wee  stand  accomptable 
for  as  much  as  any  yo''  Tenants  pay.  John  Radish  was  lett  out  for  Rent, 
but  after  the  Massacre,  (being  furnished  with  neither  cloathes  nor  pro- 
uision  nor  well  in  health)  his  IM"  kept  him  to  find  and  cloath  him  oncly: 
There  was  neither  ground  for  these  to  plant,  nor  prouision,  and  therfore 
I  gaue  way  that  3  or  4  of  them  should  be  lett  out:  and  you  see  how  lost  a 
yeare  it  was,  els  there  had  beene  made  an  agreement  for  lOO'''  of  Tob: 
and  three  barrels  of  corne  for  each:  since  Capt9  Nuces  death  M''  Threasuror 
for  the  yere  [2]  to  come  will  take  order,  that  which  is  past  hath  beene  in 
effect  lost:  I  placed  Capt9  Whitakers  vpon  the  best  ground  I  had,  where  he 
had  neere  5000  w'  of  Tobacco,  if  he  placed  no  more  of  the  Companies  Ten-

ants  there,  but  two,  and  I  had  no  more  ground  to  spare:  indeed  I  was 
streightened  for  rounie,  and  such  was  the  charge  of  guarding,  as  I  had  not 
aboue  a  1000  w*  of  Sixteene  Tenants  of  mine,  y'  Planted  at  Pasbehaighes. 
Truth  is  I  was  faine  lend  many  of  them  (hauing  wiues  and  Children)  more 
corne,  then  all  their  Croppe  of  Tobacco  was  worth:  Therfore  You  will  not 
by  this  yeare  esteeme  what  successe  may  be  hereafter,  it  was  my  ill  fortune 
to  come  when  mischief  was  breeding  couered  ouer  with  a  treacherous  peace: 
and  thinke  of  supplying  mee,  though  but  for  vpholding  the  reputacion 
of  my  place:  Fauour  vs  what  you  may  both  in  yo"'  conceptions  of  what  is 
feazible  by  vs  and  in  charging  vs,  ere  wee  be  recouered,  and  belieue  Con- 
fidently if  you  were  here,  you  would  think  w%  vs:  The  Margarett  and 
John  lighted  in  the  Company  of  a  Dutch  Ship  who  said  he  would  come 
hither,  I  should  be  glad  to  know,  what  is  to  be  done  in  those  cases,  as  also 
to  haue  a  Copy  of  the  Patent,  wee  hold  by:  Our  people  are  so  carelesse,  as 
if  you  please  to  thinke  of  some  coinission  for  a  Martiall  Court,  at  least  ad 
terrorem,  with  what  limitations  you  shall  please  for  cases  of  life,  it  may  do 
much  good:  wee  had  lately  some  cutt  off  a  trading,  who  I  know  were  strong 
enough,  and  it  manifestly  appeared  they  were  surprised  because  there 
was  not  a  piece  discharged:  without  §doubt§  either  wee  must  drive  them, 
or  they  vs  out  of  the  countrey,  for  at  one  time  or  other  they  play  vs  false, 
and  indeede  all  trade  must  be  forborne,  and  subsist  of  our  selues,  which 
hitherto  our  necessity  forced  vs  vnto:  [3]  Here  are  two  Ships  newly  come 
in  the  Margarett  and  John,  of  which  wee  were  in  despayre,  and  one  from 
M'  Gookin  with  40  men  for  him,  and  30  passengers  besides:  the  first  is  in 
great  distresse  for  prouision  and  like  to  be  burdensome  to  the  countrey 
for  that:  the  other  very  scant  also,  both  hauing=[.szc]  long  out,  and  suffred 
extreamly  in  their  Passage:  God  send  vs  in  some  ships  with  prouision  to 
ballance  the[m]  ^  Were  it  not  that  wee  are  cast  behind  hand  for  corne, 
a[nd] ^  our  men  stand  so  yll  to  health,  you  could  not  expect  that  w  *  *  *^ 
might  not  be  performed:  I  hope  one  day  to  see  you  here,  at  least  to  view 
that  countrey,  you  bestow  such  paines  vpon,  if  not  to  bestow  that  labour 
here,  if  the  place  be  worthy  of  you:  Our  aduises  are  so  yll  belieued  and 
receiued,  that  it  is  of  great  consequence  you  were  resolued  whither  wee 
are  abused  by  those  of  older  experience  in  the  countrey,  or  §wee§  all  ioyne 
to  abuse  you  by  wrong  enformacion  o[ne]  of  which  you  belieue  of  vs:

the  tardy  receait  of  your  accounts,  w^h  I  have  often  importuned.  I  have 
divers  under  arest,  &  distrained  on  the  goods  of  others;  but  the  Country 
is  so  empty  of  tobacco,  that  no  present  satisfaction  wilbe  given.  Let  it 
be  accounted  my  fault  if  you  have  it  not  the  yeare  following  w%  arerages, 
for  I  wil  trust  no  more  vnto  promises  but  seaze  on  their  crops  before  any

y^y*  §your§  informations  cam  too  late  for  me)  but  he  trusted  too  much 
vnto  those  who  had  never  formerly  faild  him.  Leifetenant  Perce  hath 
tak[en]  order  in  England  to  pay  you  the  50'  w^h  he  owes. 

I  have  beene  at  Kicotan  to  order  your  affaires  in  that  place.  Captaine 
Nuce  died  very  poore:  he  had  no  crop  of  tobacco  this  yeare,  nor  hath 
any  of  the  tenants  a  graine,  hardly,  of  corne  to  sustaine  them,  it  is  aledged 
that  most  was  spent  in  releiving  of  those  that  came  thether  for  succor. 
But  they  lay  al  on  the  short  provitions  sent  w'h  them:  by  w'^h  nieanes 
they  [de]  depart  w*h  most  of  their  corne  as  soone  as  it  is  reaped  to  dis- 
charge their  borrowings  &  besides  the  Companyes  tenants  are  planted  on 
the  barrenest  places  in  al  the  Country,  by  reason  of  your  affecting  of 
cleared  ground,  w^'h  is  generaly  worne  out,  &  vngrateful  to  the  planters. 
Captaine  Whitacres  lost  yearly  his  labor  on  the  place  where  he  was  seated. 
Of  him  onely  I  receaved  180  waight  of  tobacco,  w°h  w4i  20  more,  I  payd 
to  M"'  Cleyborne  for  his  wages  according  to  your  agreement.  He  is  now 
at  Kicotan,  drawne  thether  by  Captaine  Nuce  a  little  before  his  death. 
I  have  disposed  of  things  there  in  this  manner.  I  have  taken  Captaine 
Whitacres  bond  to  pay  you  for  the  tenants,  together  w*h  those  w'^h  he 
formerly  coinaunded,  a  hundred  waight  of  the  best  tobacco  a  man,  &  15 
bushels  of  corne,  (besides  a  like  proportion  for  themselves)  w^h  is  as  great 
a  rate  as  any  wil  do  give,  &  more  then  most  men  can  make.  Captaine 
Wfe  Wilcocks  pays  20  waight  les  a  man,  being  compounded  w'h  before:  & 
Captaine  Smith  shal  pay,  if  he  have  his,  as  much  as  the  most.  By  this 
meanes  you  wil  have  a  constant  rent,  &  equal  the  gettings  of  the  privat 
planter,  the  moyety  for  the  tenant  deducted:  w''h  other  wise  wil  com  (as 
it  hath  don)  vnto  nothing.  The  tenants  that  belong  to  Captaine  Nuce 
his  place,  I  have  suffered  his  widdow  (provided  that  it  be  alowd  of  by 
you)  to  enioy  them  this  year:  not  out  of  charity  onely,  although  she  hath 
nothing  left  to  sustaine  herself e,  &  her  poore  child  (her  houband  [sic] 
having  sould  his  land  to  furnish  himselfe  for  this  place;  she  being  besides 
a  woman  of  good  birth,  &  better  conditions.)  but  partly  out  of  right  in 
that  he  livd  a  good  part  of  the  yeare,  &  partly  out  of  necessety;  they 
having  no  corne  nor  we  able  to  help  them  w'h  any,  the  Seafloure  not  [2] 
yet  arived;  so  that  they  must  have  famished,  or  by  shifting  abroad  returnd 
you  no  proffit.  You  may  hereafter  save  the  charge  of  a  Deputy,  who  can 
no  way  advantage  you  ie    I  have  sent  you  hereinclosed  the  names  of  al

your  tenants  that  are  living;  W*h  tlie  times  past  I  wil  have  nothing  to  do; 
but  for  the  future  I  doupt  not  but  to  give  you  contentment.  Your  jjinnas 
lies  hke  a  wrack  at  Elizabeth  citty;  w"h  hath  brought  in  this  year  not  les 
then  1800  bushels  of  corne,  &  yet,  w'^h  is  strange,  not  any  in  the  Colony 
so  nere  starving  as  they.  I  sent  Nun  w'h  his  fellows  (of  whome  none 
deserve  the  name  of  a  shipwrite)  to  vew  her;  who  writ  the  woord  that 
150'  would  not  repaire  her;  w4i  was  twice  as  much,  if  not  more,  as  she 
cost:  but  one  having  offered  to  buy  her,  I  suspected  som  knavery,  &  vpon 
my  coining  downe  had  her  exactly  serched,  &  found  that  no  great  matter 
would  renew  her:  so  that  I  have  set  both  them  &  others  vpon  her.  j'et 
sailes  &  tackling  we  shal  want  except  you  supplie  vs:  &  I  doubt  not  but 
to  imploy  her  to  your  better  satisfaction. 

The  Vincrouns  are  placed  together  at  EUzabeth  Citty  &  altogether  im- 
ployed  about  silck  §silck-woormes§,  that  we  may  preserve  the  seede  & 
send  you  home  som  sUck  the  next  yeare.  for  the  planters  are  so  busied 
about  rebuildings  &  prepareing  theyr  grounds,  that  few,  at  this  time, 
ether  can,  or  wil  atend  them.  Yet  for  my  owne  part  I  have  set  4  to  do 
nothing  else:  &  i*»  prepared  the  chamber  where  in  I  ly  at  Leiftenant 
Perses  (the  fairest  m  Virginia)  for  that  purpose.  I  heare  the  Frenchmens 
times  com  out  the  next  yeare:  you  must  vse  the  meanes  to  procure  their 
stay,  &  send  more  of  their  quahty  if  you  would  have  that  woorke  goe 
realy  forward. 

Since  my  last  letter  I  feave  sent  my  shallop  with  my  servants  as  far  almost 
as  the  fals  for  sand  for  the  Glasse  men,  but  eftft  §could§  find  none  that 
would  serve;  &  since  to  Cape  Henry,  where  they  lighted  of  that  w'h  they 
like  (however  send  us  two  or  three  Hogsheds  out  of  England)  if  it  be  not 
disliked  in  the  tryal.  Al  the  servants  are  dead,  w'h  you  must  supply,  for 
the  charge  is  intollerable  to  hyre  them:  w'h,  w*h  their  provitions,  lyes  al 
vpon  me,  that  am  not  able  to  feede  my  owne  familie.  And,  to  give  a 
greater  blow  to  our  necessitys,  the  Tygar  sent  forth  a  trading  w'h  I\P 
Puntises  pinnace  vnder  Captaine  Spilman  (a  man  warie  enough  hereto- 
fore &  acquainted  w4i  their  trecheries)  is  not  onely  returned  empty,  but 
himselfe  w*h  2G  wel  armed,  sufficient  to  have  defended  themselves  against 
500  Indians,  are  cut  off  or  taken  prisoners;  ether  by  ambushes  or  too  much 
credulity:  for  as  yet  we  know  not  the  certanty.    the  ship  attempted  by  60 


APRIL  8,  162S  109 

canoues  (not  above  five  of  the  seamen  aboard)  but  were  dispersed  by  the 
discharge  of  their  Ordnance.  So  that  if  the  Seaflower  com  not  quickly 
in,  there  wil  hardly  be  found  a  preservation  against  famin.  And,  by  the 
way,  to  our  no  little  discontentment,  we  having  w'h  great  expence  set  out 
that  ship  to  Somer  Hands  for  furnishing  the  country  w'h  their  frutes,  in 
print  you  have  given  the  reputation  [to  another]     Sic  vos  non  vobis. 

[3]  Since  our  general  letter  we  have  vewed  the  place  where  we  are  now  goeing 

ftbou-t  to  erect  our  fort;  naturaly  almost  intrenched  about  w%  deepe 

ditches:  w4i,  by  the  grace  of  God,  shal  not  want  our  vtter  most  indevours 

in  the  finishing.     We  shal  need  great  ordnance,  whole  Culvering  &  demy-  g^^.  ^"^^^s  Un° 

culvering  at  the  least.     And  if  God  shal  prosper  vs,  we  wil  frame  a  plat- masking  of  Vir- 

forme  hereafter  &  sinck  it  on  the  opposite  flat,  *e  large  enough  to  containe  Ss'"'^  ' 

or  6  peeces,  &  thereby  make  the  passage  more  vnpassable  for  an  enuny. 

For  Silke  gras,  earths,  rareties  &c,  it  was  impossible  for  me  this  year,  by 
reason  of  the  trobles  &  want  of  meanes  to  send  you  any.  But  if  I  can  make 
the  pinnace  Navegable,  &  furnish  her  (w''''  I  shal  do  the  better  of  your 
healpe)  you  shal  never  [haue]  occation  to  complaine  in  that  kind. 

It  would  wel  please  the  Countrye  to  heare  that  you  had  tak[en]  revenge 
of  Dupper  for  his  stincking  beare;  w'=h  w%  what  [hath]  succeed  by  their 
contagion,  in  my  conscience  hath  beene  th[e]  death  of  200.  You  have 
imployed  a  strange  Purser:  a  m[an]  w*hout  witt,  or  out  of  his  witts:  who 
hath  lost  much  &  never  d[e]livered  a  great  part  of  his  good;  throwing  them

The  aunswere  of  diuerse  of  the  aduenturers,  &  planters  of  Virginia,  and 
the  Somer  Ilandes,  to  a  petition,  exhibited  to  his  most  Excellent 
majesty,  by  the  Lord  Cauendish  &  some  few  others,  in  the  name  of 
the  Companies 

1  It  is  allowed,  that  Alderman  Jhonson,  did  deliuer  to  his  Majesty,  a 
petition,  which  was  presented,  by  the  assent  of  many  adventurers,  then 
personally  present,  and  of  many  more,  that  were  absent. 

2  But,  that  the  informations,  in  it  contayned,  were  in  any  part  vntrue, 
eyther  touching  y"  Suppliantes,  or  in  derogation  of  the  forme  of  gouern- 
ment,  established  by  his  Majesty,  is  vtterly  denied: 

3  And  it  is  a  conjecturall,  and  vncharitable  censure:  they  neuer  haueing 
seene,  our  petition:  (as  is  implied  by  themselues)  in  y""  next  clause  of  theyr 
petition: 

4  And  the  former  petitioners  conceyue  themselues  vnworthy  such  imputa- 
tions, considering  theyr  petition  was  approued  by  the  honorable  borde, 
and  the  branches  of  the  prayer,  referred  to  bee  examined  by  Comissioners: 

5  Neyther  had  they  cause,  to  complayne  that  Alderman  Jhonson,  denied 
them  a  copy  of  the  petition,  for  hee  expresly  told  the  comittye,  that 
required  one,  hee  had  no  copy  which  his  assertion  is  true. 

Theyr  desier,  concerninge  y"  hearinge  the  complayntC  cleeringe  y"  inocent, 
and  puuishinge  y"'  delinquents,  was  y''  substance  of  our  petition,  &  wee  most 
humbly  submit  our  selues,  to  his  Majesties  order  therein  ||  and  as  wee 
conceyued  the  Course  of  cofhission  was  ^the  which  wee  desired  was  the 
onely  fayre  and  ready  way  to  prepare  those  busines  for  theyr  lordships

Surreptitious  Court;  vnseasonably  called  on  Ester  euen,  &  begun  at  an 
early,  and  extraordinary  houre,  when  men  were  at  theyr  devotions;  \-nto 
which  very  fewe  were  warned,  but  theyr  freindes,  &  confidentes;  in  which 
alsoe  one  vnwarned  ||being  ther||  theft  by  chance,  ihefe  ||and||  findinge  y^ 
assembly  strange,  both  for  tune,  persons,  &  matter  then  handled,  publiquely 
demanded,  whether  sufaons  were  giuen,  to  those  that  deliuered  y^  first 
petition;  seeing  none  of  them  were  then  present:  vnto  whom,  it  was  bj^ 
one  of  the  most  eminent  persons  in  ||y'||  Court,  as  pubhquely  answered: 
That  if  any  of  them  were  ther  they  shold  bee  desired  to  forbeare:  And  this 
is  the  more  worthy  consideration,  for  that  y''  ordinary  day  appoynted  for 
those  Courtes,  was  ouerslipt;  and  this  sodaynly,  and  extraordinarily  called, 
onely  for  this  purpose:  There  being  nothing  else  done  therem;  which  course 
hath  too  frequently  bene  practised  of  late:  thereby  to  effect  theyr  desseignes 
and  priuat  endes: 

As  for  those,  sayd  to  be  for  sundrie  yeeres,  the  disturbers  of  the  orderly,  and 
peaceable  proceedeinges  of  the  Companies  and  termed  Associates  of  Alderman 
Johnson:  wee  nmst  professe,  we  know  none  suche,  and  therfore  require  a 
more  perticuler  Charge:  generall  aspersions  in  these  kindes  being  euer  to 
be  suspected,  and  disclaimed;  and  this  Course  is  so  generally  affected  by 
our  Selues;  as  it  is  our  true  desire,  that  noe  priuate  man,  may  euer  be 
suffred  to  shrowde  him  sclfe,  vnder  the  cloke  of  the  Publick  name  of  the 
Companj'e,  but  that  euery  man  may  aunswere  single  for  himself.

If  I  shall  not  glue  you  such  satisfaction,  by  these,  as  you  expect,  &  I 
desire,  my  long  sicknes,  &  absence  from  the  §most  of  the§  busines,  since

&  I  doubt  not,  but  you  shall  receaue  information,  touching  the  most 
matters  of  greatest  importance,  from  others,  whose  acquaintance  hath 
beene  more,  with  the  late  proceedings,  then  myne.  I  had  sent  a  list, 
of  the  names  of  all  the  people,  that  dyed  or  were  slayne,  by  the  Indyans, 
since  the  massacre,  &  of  all  that  remayne  aliue,  but  since  I  could  not 
in  tyme  procure  the  bills,  from  many  perticular  plantations;  I  thought  it 
better,  to  send  you  a  perfect  catalogue,  by  the  next  ship,  then  a  lame  & 
imperfect  one  by  this.  My  earnest  desire,  &  endevour,  haue  not  beene  want- 
ing, for  the  sending  the  Tobaco,  by  this  ship,  to  pay  M"  Bland  his  30''; 
but  I  could  not  as  yett  receaue  that  poore  quantity e  of  Tobaco,  due  to  me 
from  my  5  tenants  (which  are  all  I  haue  remayning  aliue)  nor  one  grayne 
of  corn,  to  help  us,  in  this  tyme  of  scarcitye;  by  reason,  they  are  seated 
so  farre  of,  as  the  eastern  shore,  &  other  meanes  to  rayse  it,  I  could  not 
yett  possibly  finde  any;  but  by  the  next  oportunity  of  shipjiing,  after  it 
cometh  to  my  hands,  you  shall  not  fayle  to  receaue  it;  with  3''  more  also 
due  to  M"'  Bland,  for  the  transport  of  my  brother  Thomas  Fynch  (who 
dyed  soone  after  his  arriuall)  in  the  stead  of  my  my  little  daughter;  about 
which  you  were  pleased  to  send  a  few  Unes  to  Captayne  Eache.  S""  The 
benefitt  of  my  place  is  so  meane,  hauing  so  few  tenants  remayning,  &  so 
little  proffitt  by  them  in  this  troublesome  &  chargeable  tyme,  that  if  the 
§Company§  be  not  pleased  to  consider  &  repayre  my  greate  losse  by  the 
want  of  the  14  or  15  tenants  &  §certayne§  cowes  (promised)  this  two

A  Memoriall  of  some  thinges  w"=h  it  may  please  the  lis  to  insert  in  their  Lo^' 
letters  to  Virginia  and  the  Summer  Islands 

1  That  the  late  Contract  is  vpon  full  heareing  before  their  lo^^  dissolved  as 
that  wch  was  verie  preiudiciall  to  the  Plantacons  a  Coppie  of  wch  Contract 
togeather  with  the  reasons  that  were  in  writemg  delivered  against  it,  it 
may  please  their  lo^'  to  send  them  a  Coppio 

2  That  his  ma"*'  out  of  his  princelie  Care  of  their  good  is  content  that  noe 
Tobacco  shalbee  brought  into  England  or  Ireland  but  onelie  such  as 
shalbee  imported  from  the  Plantacons  in  Virginia  and  the  Sunnner  IslandC 
except  onelie  fourtie  Thousand  waight  yearelie  of  Spanish  Tobacco  (and 
that  but  for  a  tyme)  if  they  will  give  for  it  as  others  will. 

3  That  to  this  greate  and  extraordinarie  favour  his  ma""  requires  that  all 
the  Tobacco  wch  shalbee  exported  from  the  said  Plantacons  shalbee  brought 
into  England  a  thing  wch  they  themselves  have  seemed  heretofore  to  desire 
and  will  nowe  bee  most  beneficiall  vnto  them  in  regard  that  all  forreine 
marketC  wilbee  glutted  with  excessive  quantities  of  Tobacco  likelie  to  be 
brought  from  the  new  plantations  in  Brazill  Guyana  and  other  places 
wch  is  of  a  farre  better  sorte  then  that  wch  Comes  from  the  English 
Colonies  and  yet  wilbee  afforded  at  lesse  then  halfe  the  price  that  the 
English  Tobacco  hath  heretofore  binne  vsuallie  sould  for,  So  that  vnlesse 
his  ma""  in  his  great  grace  and  wisdome  should  provide  for  the  venting 
of  this  their  Comoditie  within  his  owne  dominions  they  should  not  bee 
able  to  make  any  thinge  at  all  of  it  in  anie  other  place  and  therefore

to  advise  them  to  Call  a  generall  assemblie  and  by  Common  Consent  to 
cause  an  Act  to  bee  made  to  that  purpose. 

4  That  his  ma*^  great  grace  did  not  stay  here  but  that  even  beyond  hope 
and  expectacon  his  ma*'°  is  pleased  to  bee  so  farre  from  layeing  a  greater 
burthen  vpon  them  in  regard  of  this  his  princelie  graunt  vnto  theis  Com- 
panies that  he  hath  voluntarilie  Condiscended  to  abate  3''  of  the  12'*  for 
Custome  and  Impost  wch  they  payd  heretofore:  So  that  in  Summ9  his 
ma*'''  grauntC  the  sole  Importation  and  instead  of  a  Retribucon  is  Content 
to  suffer  a  duninucon  of  what  was  formerhe  payd. 

[2]  5  That  this  his  ma*^  singuler  favour  is  yet  further  inlarged  for  that 
whereas  he  hath  heard  of  manie  Greivances  and  Inconveniences  wch  have 
hindered  the  growth  of  theis  Plantacons  he  hath  appointed  Choice  and 
able  Com's  to  examine  and  inquire  particulerlie  into  them  to  the  end  that 
all  huidrances  of  this  worthie  worke  being  removed  it  might  hereafter 
thrive  and  prosper. 

6  To  wch  the  Colonics  are  to  bee  admonished  to  afford  their  vtmost  En- 
devours  by  leaveing  the  immoderate  planting  of  Tobacco  and  applying 
themselves  to  more  staple  Commodities  and  in  particuler  to  recommend 
vnto  them  the  Care  of  nourishing  and  Increaseing  their  Silkewormes. 

7  That  they  bee  Carefull  to  choose  the  most  Comodious  places  of  abode 
for  health  and  safetie,  and  that  they  plant  themselves  soe  as  they  may 
afford  mutuall  helpe  and  strength  each  to  other  both  against  E  intestine 
and  forreigne  Enymies. 

8  And  that  his  ma''°  may  bee  more  througlie  informed  what  is  the  true 
Estate  of  the  Plantacons  at  this  present,  therfore  to  require  them  vpon 
their  dutie  and  allegiance  by  the  first  shipp  to  returne  togeather  with  their

S'  Sam:  Argall  (who  w  lined  there  diuerse  yeares  and  was  first  Admirall 
and  then  Gonerno''  of  the  Countrey)  nor  yet  Captaine  Butler  (who  resided 
there  about  3  Monethes)  haue  writt  or  sayed  any  thing  w4i  may  tend  to 
the  deprauacon  of  the  Contrey  iii  generall.  And  therefore  are  (as  is 
conceaued)  are  very  vniustlie  taxed  §in  the  foresaid  declaracon  that§

thought  that  a  man  should  dispraise  a  Controy  England  or  any  other  Contrey 
if  he  should  affirme  that  some  ptes  thereof  were  v  barren  &  vnhealthfuU 
w"h  were  a  strange  kind  of  construction. 

The  second  pte  of  their  declaracon  consists  of  a  seeming  representation  of 
the  true  es  face  of  the  Colony  in  three  periods  of  tyme:  vzt  iiTiediatly  before

[Indorsed:]  A  begining  of  an  answere  to  the  Companies  Declar9  of  the

[No.  362.] 

An  answere  to  a  Declaracon  of  the  present  state  of  Virginia  which  was 
presented  to  his  Ma""  in  Easter  weeke  laste  by  parte  of  the  Companie 
for  Virginia  vsurpinge  the  name  of  the  whole  Companie  when  in 
truth  a  4*''  parte  of  the  whole  Companie  were  prescirt  neither  sumoned 
nor  plsent  at  the  publishinge  of  it  and  very  fewe  had  theire  hand^  in  it. 
But  before  Wee  fall  vpon  o''  Answere  Wee  thincke  it  fitt  to  discover  one 
other  Artifice  by  w^h  the  truth  is  obscured  w%  w^h  they  begynne  their 
Declaracon.     For  they  say     That  in  the  end  of  December  1618  there  were 
but  600  men  and  300  Cattle  left  in  Virginia.     And  yet  they  are  Conscious 
to  them  selues  that  S'  Tho:  Smiths  gou9nm*  Contynued  vntill  Maye  w

the  Gou9nm*,  The  |jAnd  in  what  plight  and  condicon  they  now  are,  w'"h 
seemes  to  be  the  scope  of  their  declaracon,  The||  seuall  branches  whereof 
Wee  shall  nowe  pceede  punctuallie  to  answere  And  for  the  first  whereas 
they  say  That  in  the  first  12  yeares,  beinge  the  whole  tyme  y' S'  Tho: 
Smith  was  principall  Gofuio''  of  the  Companie  there  was  expended  80000" 
and  vpwardC  ||of  the  publiqj  stock||

They  say  SOOOO"  !|this  sum!|  was  expended  (beside yeluntnrieContribucionrj 
|!other  sumes  of  voluntary  planters:  !|). 

This  Clause  (besidC  vohm-te-yif^  Contribuoiefw  |!the  sumes  of  voluntary 
planters!!)  Comes  in  the  Rcare  and  it  is  [2]  thought  might  well  haue  beene

They  say  that  there  were  then  left  600  psons  and  300  Cattle  in  the  Colony 
Although  this  is  noe  small  matter  Consideringe  the  Infancie  of  the 
Plantacon  in  those  tymes  and  the  many  Difficulties  they  mett  w'hall  in 
theire  first  enterprises  that  eeiy  w*h  !|less  then!|  the  expence  of  70000"

parte  of  the  services  that  were  then  pformed. 

But  let  vs  see  whether  they  deale  more  ingeniously  in  that  Wh  foUow- 
eth.  They  say  That  the  Companie  was  left  then  in  debt  neere  5000''  [4] 
But  they  are  desired  to  sett  downe  Av'hall  what  was  left  in  stocke  toward?

Companie  w''h  since  that  tyme  haue  beene  payd  in  and  then  it  Avill  appeare 
whether  there  be  not  likewise  a  Defecte  of  truth  in  this  CLause  as  well  as

But  though  the  Autho'"^  of  this  Dechiracon  mistooke  the  former,  yet  per- 
happs  they  will  come  neerer  the  Alarke  in  declareinge  the  jSsent  State  of 
this  Plantacon II,  during  tfee  and  of  that  w^h  hath  ben  done  during  the 
lastgouerment.|| 

They  say  therefore  that  whereas  about  a  4  yeares  since  there  were  Imt  fiOO 
psons,  nowc  (notwithstandinge  the  late  jNIortalitie  and  Massacre)  tliere 
are  r(>mayninge  as  they  Compute  about  2500  psons. 

To  w'h  wee  answere  that  this  Parenthesis  of  (Notw*hstandinge  the  late 
Morlnlitie  and  Massacre)  is  not  soe  slightly  to  be  passed  over  seeinge

remayninge  were  sent  with  thexpence  only  of  30000"  of  the  publicb  stock 
besides  the  charges  of  pticuler  societies  and  Planters. 

To  wii  is  answered  that  it  is  too  grosse  a  golecisme  || contradiction  of 
theiTiseluesll  to  say  that  the  psons  nowe  remayninge  in  Virginia  were 
sent  thither  at  the  Charge  of  the  30000''  i)ubliq5  stock  in  the  Declaracon 
menconed  whereas  themselues  Confesse  Init  a  fewe  lynes  licfore  that  there

imployed  about  the  transportacon  of  60U  of  those  2600  psons  w''h  as  they 
pitend  are  now  remayninge. 

But  is  this  30000"  all  the  money  thatfe  hath  beene  spent  in  theis  plantaf-ons 
since  S''  Tho:  Smiths  tyme?  they  implj-  noe,  l)ut  (w'hout  nameinge  any

be  a  farr  greater  Sume  tlien  the  form9  and  therefore  worth  the  nameinge.

The  Cattle  they  say  what  by  Newe  supplies  and  what  by  increase  of  the

It  is  strange  to  see  howe  theis  thing?  are  sluiffled  togetlier  tendinge  to 
obscure  the  truth  for  it  had  beene  a  very  easie  Matter  and  a  farre  more 
Directe  Course  to  haue  ||  distinguished  these  and  to  haue||  sett  downe  the 
number  of  Cattle  that  haue  beene  sent  w'liin  theis  4  yeares  w'^h  for  ought

to  Cover  that  erro'  But  touchinge  the  number  [8]  of  Cattle  Wee  may 
well  from  their  owne  Confession  make  this  Colleccon:  The  Cattle  W^h

Wee  haue  Crediblie  heard  for  want  of  good  lookeinge  to  in  Virginia. 
Many  alsoe  haue  bcene  slayne  by  the  Indians  since  the  last  Massacre. 
And  yet  if  there  remayne  aboue  1000  it  must  necessarihe  foUowe  that  there 
were  m  many  aboue  300  lefte  by  the  old  Gou9nm*  But  to  howe  manie 
more  might  these  haue  becne  encreased  had  not  soe  many  persons  beenc 
vnfortunatelie  and  inconsideratelie  (as  is  Conceived)  sent  over  to  Consume

that  all  they  speake  of  to  purpose  in  this  Clause  is  only  thencrease  of  the

right  therein  By  w^h  it  appeareth  that  even  this  way  beside?  all  others  the 
Companie  is  at  least  4400"  in  debt.  And  it  is  Conceived  that  the  seale  of 
the  Company  is  given  here  §for§  at  least  2000"  more  And  the  vnder

A  note  of  some  thinges  fit  to  bee  inquired  into  by  the  Com^s.  for  the  better 
discouerie  of  the  true  estate  and  Condition  of  the  Plantations,  and  of 
the  proceedeinges  and  cariage  of  that  buisinesse. 

And  first  for  that  of  Virginia. 

This  Inquirie  is  to  respect  two  severall  times,  vizt  the  time  when  the  affaires 
of  those  Plantar ons  were  chief elye  directed  by  S'  Tho:  Smith  (wch  was 
about  the  space  of  ten  or  twelve  yeares)  and  the  tyme  since  hee  gave  over 
the  said  Government  to  this  p!sent. 

Concerning  the  first,  for  a  more  distinct  proceeding  in  this  Examjaiacon, 
theis  tilings  amongst  manie  others  may  bee  inquired  into. 

1.  When  the  first  Pattent  beganne,  how  by  degrees  that  Plantacon  was 
prosequuted,  by  what  rules  those  affaires  are,  and  haue  binne  governed, 
and  whether  the  same  shalbee  thought  fit  to  bee  contincwd,  or  altered  to 
a  better. 

2  What  moneyes  were  received  in  the  severall  yeares  of  S'  Thomas  Smithes 
Government,  to  whom  they  were  paid,  who  kept  the  Accompt  of  them, 
howe  the  said  moneyes  were  severallie  brought  in,  vizt.  what  by  Lotteries, 
what  by  other  Collections,  and  what  by  voluntarie  Adventures,  and  how 
those  moneyes  haue  bynne  accompted  for,  and  what  discharges  thereupon 
given. 

3  What  ships,  men,  Cattle,  municon,  nnd  furniture  were  set  forth  in  tlie 
said  severall  yeares. 

4  What  publique  Work^  were  effected  dureing  this  Government,  vizt  what 
houses  or  Townes  built,  what  bridges,  what  fortC,  what  Churches  &c.    what

the  publique  stocke  and  for  the  benifit  of  the  publique, 

5  What  were  the  vsuall  prices  of  Corne  and  Provisions  in  the  CoUonye 
dureing  the  time  of  S""  Thomas  Smithes  Government,  how  were  they  sup- 
plied of  victuall  &c  from  hence,  whether  vpon  the  publique  stocke,  or  by 
private  Adventurers  that  made  Comoditie,  and  advantage  of  what  they 
sent  thither. 

6.  What  magazines  were  set  vp  in  S"^  Thomas  Smithes  time,  and  by  whom, 
what  were  the  vsuall  prizes  at  wch  the  said  magazines  bought  and  sold, 
by  whom  were  the  said  magazines  cheifelie  mannaged,  and  what  gaine  or 
losse  came  to  the  Adventurers  thereby. 

7  What  staple  Comodities  were  raised  and  what  attempted  dureing  the 
time  aforesaid. 

[2]  8  Whether  was  there  anie  open  and  notable  differences  and  dissentions, 
among  the  Companie  here,  dureing  the  time  aforesaid,  if  anie  how  did 
they  growe,  and  how  were  they  compounded,  or  was  there  a  generall 
Concord,  and  agreement  amongst  them,  and  in  what  Tearmes  stood  the 
Collonies  there  a*  at  that  tyme  in  regard  of  peace,  or  enmitie  with  the 
Savages. 

9  Howe  came  the  lotteries  first  to  be  invented,  and  by  whom,  when  did 
they  beginne,  who  directed  that  buisines,  and  who  were  imployed  as  Agents 
in  it,  what  frauds  or  abuses  were  comitted  in  the  cariage  of  them,  howe 
were  the  said  lotteries  furnished,  and  by  whom,  whether  vpon  the  publique 
stocke,  or  by  private  men,  and  who  were  they  that  did  s  helpe  to  supplie 
i*  it  with  prizes,  or  Comodities  of  their  owne  prop  good^,  money,  plate,  or 
Jewells  &c.  what  were  the  particulers  that  were  so  put  in,  and  vpon  what 
Tearmes,  and  what  gaine  or  losse  came  to  such  private  Persons,  in  lieu  of

course  was  held  for  secureing  a  true  Accompt  to  bee  given,  of  all  the  said 
moneyes,  what  Charges  for  dyet,  horsemeat,  and  travaileing  expences  were 
demanded,  by  those  that  mannaged  that  buisines,  and  what  for  those 
Charges  was  allowed,  and  by  whom  was  the  said  allowance  of  ordinarie 
Charges  made,  what  rewards  were  given  to  anie  Person  or  Persons  whatso- 
ever out  of  the  said  lotteries,  and  by  whom,  and  in  what  respect,  what 
Accompt  was  made  of  the  moneyes,  &c  thus  Collected,  and  by  whom, 
who  tooke  th'accompt,  to  whom  were  the  said  moneyes  paid,  and  what 
discharges  haue  binne  given  for  it. 

How  long  did  the  said  lotteries  Continew,  did  they  for  a  time  cease,  how 
came  they  to  cease,  and  how,  when,  and  by  whom  were  they  againe  set  vp, 
and  how  came  it  to  passe  that  at  last  they  were  quite  taken  away. 

[3]  Tlie  like  Course  of  Examynacon  to  bee  held  for  the  4  yeares  since  8'' 
Thomas  Smith  mutatis  mutandis.  With  a  particuler  direction,  exactlie 
to  distinguish  the  men,  municon.  Cattle  and  other  supplies  sent  Ijy  private 
Pattentees,  and  such  as  were  sent  vpon  the  publique  stocke.  (for  it  is  to 
bee  observed  and  remembred,  that  divers  have  taken  PattentC  and  ]ilanted 
at  their  owne  Charge,  well  is  no  part  of  the  publique.)  As  also  to  Inquire 
throughlie  what  Commoditie  hath  ben  produced  dureing  the  said  last 
yeares  in  lieu  of  the  great  expence  of  this§e§  publique  Treasure,  raised  by 
lotteries,  collections,  voluntarie  Contribucons  &c.  who  hath  had  the 
benifit  hereof  if  anie  hath  ben  made,  what  new  offices  haue  liin  in  this  time 
invented,  who  are  the  principal  Officers,  what  allowance  is  made  vnto 
them,  and  by  \\hom,  and  what  Charge  haue  they  put  the  Companie  to 

That  the  Com""^  inquire  carefulhe  vpon  what  ground^  good  and  warrant- 
able ground?  the  Companie  adventured  to  send  such  nuiltitudes  of  people 
theis  4  last  yeares,  whether  the  sending  of  so  manie  people  hath  not  vndis- 
creetelie  wasted  the  wliole  publique  stocke,  and  bin  a  meanes  to  cast 
away  the  lyves  of  so  manie  of  his  ma*^  Subiect?,  therefore  to  know  what 
Intelligence  they  kept  with  the  cheife  of  the  Collony  there,  to  vnderstand 
whetluM-  they  were  able  to  lodge,  and  feed  so  great  a  number  as  were  from 
time  to  time  transported  thither.  Tliat  the  Conies  cause  that  vpon  oath 
they  produce  all  tlieir  Ires  to  that  i)urpose  pswadeing  or  diswadeing  the

So  that  being  thus  compelled  to  bring  in  all  they  doe  not  ease 
themselues  (as  the  Customers  pretend)  of  3''  the  pound:  but 
they  doe  charge  the  tobacco  with  6''  the  pound  more  then 
they  formerly  payd:  And  the  ffarmors  although  they  pre- 
tend to  abate  for  the  good  of  the  Plantations  in  reguard  that 
in  euery  perticuler  pound  they  abate  3'^  yet  indeed  they  take 
very  much  from  them  for  whereas  bringing  in  only  \A'hat

that  they  doe  abate  3''  in  the  pound,  yet  indeed  they  make  the  Owner 
pay  G''  a  pound  more,  and  so  I  nuist  conclude,  that  every  pound  standi  in 
18''  So  that  it  appeareth  playnly  that  the  condicon  onely  of  being  forced 
to  bring  all  in  from  the  Plantations  dotli  putt  y'  Companies  in  a  farre 
worse  case  then  they  were  before  although  there  be  3'^  in  a  pound  abated

by  order  from  hence  to  be  sent  ouer  d  euery  yeare,  that  so  the  Company 
here  may  discerne  of  the  strength  of  the  Colony.  This  is  either  omitted 
this  yeare  or  concealed  from  vs.  And  no  reason  ettft  be  §is§  alleadged, 
for  tlie  omittal  of  it  but  on  the  contrarye  it  was  easier  this  yeare  to  liaue 
taken  euery  mans  name  in  the  Colony,  because  tfeefs'  were  by  reason  of  the 
Massacre  they  were  driuen  from  their  s  seuerall  Plantacons  and  forced  to 
inhabitt  neare  together 

2'''  By  the  last  Muster  Rowle  of  the  people  there  taken  §the  last  Suiner§ 
much  about  the  tyme  of  the  Massacre  there  were  in  all  of  men  women  & 
Children  §in  Virginia§  but  1240:  ftftd  except  only  the  people  remayning  at 
Warasquiack  w'^''  were  but  3  households.  Since  w'^h  tyme  their  letters 
make  mencon  of  5  or  600  that  haue  pished  w'h  sicknes  and  famine.  And 
many  after  that  tyme  perished  by  the  hand^  of  th'Indians. 

And  here  we  doe  obserue  that  when  this  Muster  Roule  of  the  yeare  1622 
was  taken  it  appeareth  §by  the  printed  bookes  of  tlie  Companye§  that  t  in

S''  Thomas  Smith  left  the  Gouerm':  w'=''  makes  4370  psons.  So  that  it  is 
playne  by  those  Muster  Roules  that  §euen§  in  those  3  yeares  before  the 
Massacre  there  were  lost  aboue  three  thowsand  soules  §w''''  needC  proceed 
from  much  negligence  &  want  of  good  gou9nt:§  besidC  those  that  haue 
pished  fey  t  since  by  th'Indians  and  by  sicknes:  And  so  consequently  that 
the  people  remayning  in  the  Colony  are  but  few.  w''''  likewise  appeares 
by  some  of  their  tres. 

3:  M'  George  Sandys  in  his  tre  to  M"'  Wrott  hath  these  word?  The 
lyuing  haue  ben  hardlie  able  to  bury  the  dead  thorough  their  Imbecillitie 
We  haue  lost  not  less  then  500  by  sicknes  (w*h  a  generall  weakenes  of  the 
rest)  w^h  taken  out  of  so  small  a  nomber  forth  §farr§  short  of  yo""  Coniec- 
tures  I  belieue  haue  not  left  behind  them  so  many  able  men  in  the  Contrey: 
And  more  expressly  he  saieth  that  out  of  the  whole  Colony  %he  we  could 
rayse  but  180  whereof  80  were  fitt  only  to  carry  burthens. 

Againe  the  Gouerno"'  S""  Francis  Wyatt  4  Aprill  last  writes  te  [sic]  §in§  his 
father  sayeth  thus:  They  (meaninge  the  Company  here)  talke  [2]  of  an 
Armye  of  500  to  issue  out  vpon  th'  Indians  in  all  parts  and  after  a  Rufiing 
Armye  of  150  to  vex  them  in  all  places  This  ioyned  w*h  the  5"'  man  te 
kccpo  for  the  ffort  would  leaue  some  xx  men  to  guard  40  Plantarons  halfe 
a  man  to  each,  counting  any  that  were  tolerable  shott  for  a  man.  I  know 
what  I  say  and  to  whom  I  speak  it. 

Againe  we  fed  beside  diuerse  passages  in  their  Ires  from  thence  by  w'h 
we  may  discerne  the  paucitie  of  the  people  we  find  that  one  Wittm  Capps 
beeing  generalhe  approued  as  a  fitt  man  to  be  imployed  against  tliTntlians 
he  demanding  but  49  30  small  shott  and  10  men  to  secure  the  Boates  was 
as  it  seemes  putt  of  w-h  §by§  this  Reason  giuen  in  their  Counsell  there. 
That  if  theis  men  should  be  slayne  then  their  whole  state  were  ouerthrowne. 
By  all  w^h  we  conceaue  that  in  truth  their  nombers  are  very  small  and 
weake:  And  in  great  danger  cither  to  be  vtterlie  ruyned  either  by  th  Enemy 
or  by  ff amine  or  both.

A  Copie  of  the  letter  to  the  Governor  and  Counsell  of  Virginia  by  the 
Bony  Bess 

After  o''  very  hartie  Comendacons:  Wee  haue  receaved  yo'  letters  sent  by 
the  Trueloue  and  James,  whereby  we  vnd'stand  through  Gods  assistance 
yo"  haue  made  a  good  begining  to  that  iust  revenge  W*"  yo"  owe  the  Autho''^ 
of  that  bloody  Massacre:  w"^**  we  desire  yo"  very  earnestly  w'^  all  diligence 
and  care  to  prosecute,  according  to  the  advise  and  instruccons  we  haue 
formerly  given  yo"  and  that  course  yo"  haue  already  begun,  vntill  yo" 
haue  so  fully  accomplished  it  as  yo'  security  from  all  danger  in  that  kind 
may  be  fully  wrought. 

We  cannot  but  be  much  grieved  at  the  Sicknes  and  mortality  that  hath 
hapned  since  the  Massacre,  wherein  although  we  do  acknowledge  the 
hand  of  God  in  chastizmg  of  o""'  and  yo"'  Sines,  yet  since  both  now  and 
formerly  it  hath  as  from  the  naturall  causes  proceeded  in  great  part  through 
distempers  and  disorders  in  dyet  and  lodginge;  we  most  especially  recomend 
vnto  yo''  care  the  ptventing  and  remedieing  of  those  inconveniences, 
accordinge  to  those  good  and  provident  courses  w"''  we  haue  so  often 
advised  and  directed  yo"  vnto:  and  in  pticuler  we  cannot  but  require,  w"h 
we  haue  so  often  heretofore  vrged  the  building  of  Guest-houses  in  each 
Citty  and  Borough  for  the  enterteinm'  of  new  comers,  whereof  yo''  letters 
of  the  last  yeare  gaue  such  hope  and  assurance,  in  regard  of  the  great 
retribution  of  1500'  w"""  yo"  signified  was  to  be  gathred  amongst  yo",  as 
we  verily  expected  the  pformance  thereof  ere  this  time;  but  as  we  do  con- 
ceiue  and  in  part  excuse  the  delay  thereof  through  that  great  misfortune 
that  befell  yo",  so  we  now  cannot  but  require  so  much  more  dilligcnce  and 
care  for  the  speedy  pformance  thereof.  And  in  the  meane  while  we  very

guarded,  vntill  they  can  giue  notice  thereof  to  the  Governo',  or  send  them

To  the  Kinges  most  excellent  Ma*'''  The  most  humble  Petiton  of  the 
Treasurer  Councell  and  Companie  for  Virginia 

Yo'  ma**^  most  humble  Suppliants  haueing  latelie  received  yo'  Ma*^  letter, 
and  in  the  same  theis  two  ComandmentS,  one  that  no  man  shall  come  to 
their  Courts,  or  Committees,  who  besides  his  freedome  and  land,  hath 
not  some  men  nowe,  or  latelie  planted  vpon  his  shares,  or  that  is  not  at 
this  Instant  ingaged  (and  accordinglie  pursues)  to  send  men  or  Supplies 
thither  by  the  next  shipping. 

Another  that  the  Councell  or  Companie  sliall  not  liring  ^•nto  the  Com" 
anie  Complaint  in  their  owne  name,  against  anie  man.  They  find  that  the 
form9  of  yo''  ma*^  ComaundS  without  certaine  danger  of  the  Instant  dis- 
solucon  of  the  Companie,  and  Plantacon,  it  is  impossible  to  bee  obserued. 
And  the  latter  of  them  tendeth  to  the  vtter  disabling  of  them  in  the  prose- 
cution of  the  greate,  and  manifold  wrongC  done  vnto  the  Companie,  as 
by  the  reasons  hereunto  annexed  as  they  conceive  will  appeare  Which 
they  humblie  beseech  yo''  Ma*'"  to  vouchsafe  to  puse  And  Conceiueing 
that  yo''  Ma*^  said  ComaundC  haue  proceeded  from  misinformacon  of  yo' 
ma''",  in  the  plsent  State  of  the  Courts  and  of  their  busines,  that  you 
wilbe  graciouslie  pleased,  either  to  alter  yo''  said  Comand,  or  else  to  referre 
the  same  to  the  heareing  of  the  lordC  of  yo''  ma*^  most  honorable  Privie

In  Conformitie  whereof  and  most  humble  obedience  to  yo"^  ma**-'  Comaund, 
they  are  resolued  no  more  to  assemble  without  yo''  gracious  assent,  al- 
though this  suspension  may  happen  to  proue  infinitelie  pliudiciall  to  the 
Collonie.  And  yo''  ma**^  said  Suppliants  shall  according  to  their  bounden

Whereas  his  Ma*'"  by  his  letter  coinands  that  none  shall  come  to  the 
Virginia  Courts  or  Cofnittees  but  such  as  haue  shares  in  Virginia,  and  men 
plant  either  now  planted  vpon  them  or  to  be  planted  by  the  next  Shipping. 

Ob. 

The  Company  haue  resolued  to  petition  his  Ma''*'  that  §all§  those  men 
that  are  ioyned  together  in  one  Patent,  and  vppon  a  ioynt  Stock  haue 
planted,  that  euery  one  of  these  Patentees  may  come  to  the  Courts  and 
haue  a  voyce: 

Answ. 

This  §if  it  bee  granted§  will  vtterly  defeate  his  Ma"™  purpose  to  preuent 
the  meeting  of  a  multitude  together:  for  there  are  50  or  60  Patents  of 
this  nature  granted,  and  in  each  Patent  there  are  vsually  40  or  50  ioynt 
Aduenturers,  and  so  they  may  at  that  rate  assemble  three  two  or  three 
thousand  people  together. 

XT  tS  Tiiiorciorc  ciosj'  rcci 

It  may  therefore  (if  so  it  please  his  Ma"'=)  be  answered  that  for  euery 
of  those  petty  Plantations  which  are  §so§  made  by  a  ioynt  stock  they 
may  choose  one  na  or  two  men  §(such  as  haue  paid  in  their  money  for 
that  Plantacon)§  in  the  name  of  the  rest  to  be  present  at  theyr  Courts 
and  that  for  the  businesses  of  each  seuerall  Plantation  the  Patentees  may 
meete  together  among  themselues  as  they  were  wont  to  doe:  So  theyr 
priuate  Plantations  may  be  ordered  among  them  that  are  partners  in  y' 
Plantation:  and  yet  the  Courts  not  pestered  with  multitudes,  nor  no  man 
at  any  preiudice 

The  second  part  of  his  Ma*'"^  letter  is  that  no  Complaynts  shalbe  brought 
to  the  Comissioners  in  the  name  of  the  Company 

'  This  document  is  in  the  handwriting  of  Sir  Nathaniel  Rich.

Against  this  they  intend  likewise  to  petition  because  by  this  meanes 
(they  say)  ft©  the  Iniuries  offered  to  the  Company  as  cannot  be  com- 
playned  of,  for  no  p  man  will  become  an  Informer 

To  this  it  is  answered  that  the  Company  may  appoint  3  or  4  who  may 
receaue  and  collect  all  comp  wrongs  of  that  nature,  and  if  they  be  such 
as  wilbe  by  any  man  iustified  they  may  be  presented  to  the  Com'"  wttfe 
§vnder§  theyr  names  that  will  iustifie  it:  Otherwise  any  man  of  what 
qualitye  soeuer  may  be  shamefully  traduced  by  a  multitude  and  can  haue 
no  redress  for  it,  w4i  was  one  mayne  reason  why  his  Ma"''  m  and  the 
Lords  made  that  Order.

They  pltend  by  a  nice  and  litterall  interpltacon  of  his  Ma*'*'"  Lettres  to 
induce  a  conceipt  and  opinion  in  the  Court,  that  there  the  exclusion  of 
so  many  was  purposed  therby  m  as  weer  coinpHiended  w^'ui  the  §strict§ 
lettre  of  the  phibicon  ef  §fro  being§  [being]  pisent  at  Court  or  Comittee

acbiiitted  any  such,   say  they 

As  haue  now  actually  men  planted  vpon  ther  pp  and  ewft  planta- 
eeeft  §particular  shares  §  by  w"''  they  pltend  to  be  excluded 

Ffirst  all  such  as  plant  joyntly,  so  that  ioyant-planters  of  Hun- 
dreds &c  are  excluded. 

Secondly  such  as  haue  planted  but  ther  fee  (people  being  dead) 
ther  plantacons  are  now  not  plsently  occupied  &  dwelt  vpon.

Thirdly  such  as  hauing  men  ther;  but  ther  men  being  vpon  th^nd  that  iKme 
occasion  past  drawne  fro  ther  pp  plantacons,  *feey  being  epoyld  posi^,g"^^to  flemi 
did  possesse  others  plafis  men  by  the  m- 

ediate  next  sliip- 

Lastly  all  such  as  weer  engaged  by  plsent  supplies  expecting  fro  ping)  eouid  be 
hence  returne  of  ther  comoditie.  adnutted  to  the 

Court. 

And  inferr  that  m  ther  are  not  men  enough  so  qualified  as  shall 
or  can  make  vp  a  number  of  y*^  Court. 

To  this  wee  Answeare  wee  conceiue  his  Ma*'''^  pleasure  is  only  to  s«  exclude 
such  as  hauing  no  plsent  stocke  running  ther  either  in  men  or  supplies 
alone  or  w'h  others  nor  expecting  or  hauinge  fro  thence  no  ]5tsent  profitt  or 
disprofitt,  ought  not  by  ther  votes  to  charge  or  order  other  mens  interests. 
Ther  being  besids  much  suspicon  that  such  votes  serue  only  to  make  vp  a 
side  therby  to  double  yt  to  cary  what  yt  pleaseth  to  the  disadvantage  of 
such  as  are  ingaged  in  the  p!sent  advancem*  of  the  plantacons  aed  by 
supplies  of  men  or  pulsions. 

[2]  And  therefore  wee  conceiue  his  Ma*'*^^  pleasure  is. 

That  all  men  w'^''  a*e  free  of  the  companie  ftftd  haue§ing§  shares 
that  ether  haue  had  men  vpon  ther  plantacons:  or  haue  men  or 
servants  resident  ther  vpon  ther  pp  plantacons:  or  vpon  a  ioynt- 
plantacon:  or  are  engaged  by  supplies  expecting  returne  of 
coiTioditie,  are  enabled  and  allowed  to  be  plsent  at  Comittees  & 
Courts.  Of  w'h  ther  are  many  hundreds  suffycient  for  abilitie  or 
number  to  hould  Courts. 

And  therfore  some  declaracon  &  explanacon  may  be  made  of  his  Ma'"''^ 
lettre  by  his  Ma''**^  or  the  L^*^  InterpStacon  and  no  reason  to  alter  but 
explyan. 

Ther  peticon  relating  reciting  the  two  phibicons  of  his  Ma"''^  lettres  desires 
the  alteracon  of  his  Ma"*'^  inhibicons  as  pceeding  fro  his  Ma'^  vpon  mishi- 
formacon.  The  first  tending  in  effect  to  dissolue  the  companie  by  dis- 
abling them  to  hould  any  Court.  Aad  W4i  this  that  they  durst  not  he 
returne  agayne  to  hould  any  Court  vntill  the  same  was  revoked:  And  that 
the  second  tended  to  take  fro  them  all  redresse  of  any  wrongs  done  to  the 
Companie  or  any  way  to  complayne.

and  to  exclude  them  from  tlie  moste  important  Consultacons  of  the 
Company  as  they  conceive  it  to  be  noe  Way  in  the  power  of  the  Company 
to  doe,  as  beinge  Contrary  to  yo'  Mat<^  Ires  Patents  soe  it  must  needC  be 
to  theire  vnderstandinge  a  gen9aU  dishartninge  of  all  men  and  a  plsage  of 
future  evill  and  as  they  feare  will  Cause  this  great  Worke  to  be  forthw'h 
abandoned. 

Secondly  by  Yo''  Ma*-*^  Ires  Patents  there  can  be  noe  Courte  kept  vnder  the 
number  of  Five  of  the  Councell  and  Fifteene  of  the  Gen9allitie  w'h  nomber 
is  impossiljle  to  be  made  vp  at  this  p!sent  w'hin  theis  limitacons  nowe 
plscribed  hy  Yo''  Ma*''' 

For  yo'  Ma*'"  may  l^e  pleased  to  be  informed  that  although  the  engagement 
and  adventures  of  the  most  of  them  that  doe  nowe  vsually  followe  and 
attend  the  Co''t^  (except  those  only  that  haue  of  late  opposed  the  Company) 
be  very  greate  and  too  many  of  them  the  best  parte  of  theire  estates  yet 
veiy  fewe  of  them  either  nowe  or  formerly  haue  had  any  men  planted  on 
theire  perticuler  shares  it  beinge  the  Custome  for  divers  to  ioyne  together 
in  one  body  or  ioynt  stocke,  and  the  like  Course  is  held  in  Magazines  and 
all  other  Adventures  the  retornes  whereof  beinge  dayly  expected  will  noe 
doubt  drawe  them  on  to  a  newe  and  Contynuall  supplie  both  of  Men 
and  provision. 

But  if  for  any  the  least  tyme  the  care  of  them  should  be  neglected  (and 
otherwise  then  in  publiq.  Court?  and  Coihittees  they  cannot  treate  nor 
order  them)  there  must  need?  followe  an  inevitable  pjiudice  if  not  vtter 
ruyn  of  all  mens  estates  there  and  here  and  a  Certeyne  stoppe  to  that  happy 
Way  of  the  Plantacons  encreas  wherein  nowe  it  runnes:  Wherevnto  not 
only  those  whoe  doe  nowe  bringe  in  moneyes  and  make  supplies  but  divers 
likewise  of  the  Auncient  Adventurers  whoe  havinge  by  the  misgovernm' 
of  former  tymes  lost  all  theire  former  adventure  can  nowe  hardly  be  pswaded 
to  adventure  anewe,  Yet  theire  plsence  in  the  Court?  theire  Advice  theire 
industry  and  other  manifold  assistance  encourageth  dayly  a  multitude  of 
able  Planters  m  pson  to  transporte  themselues  thither  and  soe  to  advance 
the  Plantacon:  Besid?  a  greate  parte  of  theis  beinge  men  of  quahtie  when 
occasion  of  publiqj  benefit  as  fortificacon  or  other  provision  for  the  strength 
or  benefitt  of  the  CoUonie  shall  require  the  gen9all  Contribucon  of  the 
Adventurers  are  and  haue  beene  ever  the  most  ready  of  all  others  to  lay

out  theire  moneyes  as  men  not  fixeinge  theire  niyndes  on  the  hope  of  hasty 
gayne  from  a  private  Plantacon. 

Soe  that  to  debarre  and  exclude  them  even  in  this  regard  much  hinder  and 
sett  backe  the  encrease  of  the  Plantacon  by  depriveinge  the  Courts  of  soe 
many  able  and  vnderstandinge  psons,  and  soe  well  versed  and  experienced 
in  the  busines  [2]  besides  that  the  good  and  fayre  Carriage  of  the  busines 
theis  last  foure  yeares  hath  soe  wound  vpon  divers  of  the  said  auncient 
Adventurers  as  they  doubted  not  to  haue  had  newe  and  fresh  supplies 
from  them  before  this ;  in  Case  theis  late  troubles  and  distraccons  had  not 
happened  And  soe  much  the  more  doe  they  Conceive  it  needfull  that  the 
Court?  be  nowe  frequently  attended  in  respect  of  that  gen9aU  discour- 
agem*  given  by  that  Vnmaskinge  of  Virginia  plsented  vnto  yo''  Ala''^  by 
Capt  Butler  Soe  that  if  by  the  pformeinge  of  this  Yo""  Mat?  Comaund  the 
said  Court?  and  other  meeting?  should  for  the  tyme  be  discharged  (w'=h 
they  Conceive  will  of  necessitye  followe,  if  Yo''  Ma*^*^  CoiTaaund  herein  be 
still  Contynued)  must  need?  breed  an  instant  dissolucon  of  this  great 
Worke  w^h  would  be  hardly  ever  possible  by  o""  meanes  to  be  sett  vp  againe. 

Touchinge  the  later  point  of  Yo""  Ma*^  said  tre  wherein  you  are 
pleased  to  forbid  that  noe  Complaint  be  brought  to  the  Comissioners 
against  any  man  in  the  name  of  the  Councell  or  Companie  but  that  the 
Complaynant?  subscribe  their  Complaint?  w'h  theire  owne  names  Wee 
hold  o^selues  bound  in  the  greatest  bond  of  dutie  to  signifie  vnto  yo""  Ma"^ 
that  wee  Conceive  that  in  effecte  this  will  tend  to  noe  lesse  then  an  ex- 
empcon  from  any  Complaint  to  be  brought  against  any  of  those  tymes  and 
psons  Wherein  andby  Whome  huge  suiTies  were  in  greatest  parte  mispent; 
Yo""  Ma*^  gratious  instruccons  and  direccons  violated  or  neglected  the 
Plantacon  oppressed,  robbed,  and  ruyned  and  other  outrages  of  very  high 
nature  CoiTiitted  by  rovinge  and  robbing  on  the  Spanish  Territories  in  the 
West  Indies  and  faction  lately  begunne  and  maynteyned  in  the  Court? 
and  Comi)anie  All  w"h  havinge  beene  done  to  the  wronge  of  the  publiq, 
and  Countenanced  by  some  of  o'  societye  there  is  noe  pticuler  pson  or 
psons  to  be  found  of  all  the  Company  as  Wee  Conceive  whoe  for  prosecute- 
ing  of  theis  publicb  iniuries  will  expose  themselues  to  soe  much  private 
Mallice  and  to  such  sharpe  revenge  as  hath  beene  threatned  heretofore  in 
some  of  theis  Cases. 


MAT  25, 162S  207 

And  they  humbly  desire  that  yo^  Ma*'^  wilbe  further  pleased  to  take 
knowledge  that  the  principall  Wrong?  and  iniuries  Wh  they  shall  coniplaine 
of  haue  not  beene  done  to  any  pticuler.  For  if  S'  Thomas  Smith  haue  not 
rightly  disposed  of  the  moneyes  in  his  Charge,  it  is  not  a  Wronge  to  any 
private  man  but  to  the  Companie.  If  S"^  Samuell  Argall  hath  ruyned  and 
made  dep'dacon  of  the  Colony  in  Virginia  the  iniurie  is  not  to  any  pticuler 
pson  but  to  the  Company.  If  by  sending  out  a  shipp  by  Capt:  Argall  and 
his  Partners  to  make  spoile  vpon  the  Spanish  territories  in  the  West  Indies 
there  had  followed  that  mischeife  w'^h  was  both  threatned  and  feared  by 
theire  takeinge  revenge  vpon  the  Colony  in  Virginia  that  had  not  beene  the 
losse  of  a  pticuler,  but  of  the  Company.  If  that  intencon  of  Capteyne 
Butlers  in  his  paper  of  Vnmaskinge  of  Virginia  had  taken  his  desired  effecte 
to  the  disgrace  and  Consquently  ruyn  of  the  Plantacons  private  psons 
might  suffer  but  the  Notorious  iniurie  is  done  to  the  Company,  and  soe 
they  might  instance  in  diu9s  other  pticuler  offences  done  to  the  body  of 
the  Companie  and  not  to  any  pticuler  psons. 

And  for  iniuries  done  to  anie  private  psons  except  it  be  the  Complaint 
of  a  multitude  the  Company  ever  intended  to  leave  them  to  their  owne 
psecucon  And  what  they  shall  doe  as  an  vnited  body,  they  doe  not  nor 
cannot  w4i  any  jStence  of  reason  goe  aboute  the  Acte  of  the  Courte  to 
ploccupate  the  iudgm*  of  Yo"'  Ma*'^  Comissioners,  or  to  oppose  therevnto 
any  such  Acte  [3]  of  Courte.  But  as  the  Informacon  of  anie  pticuler 
man,  is  the  Acte  of  that  one  man  and  standeth  only  but  as  his  accu- 
sacon  Soe  they  humbly  beseech  Yo''  Ma*'"  that  this  exhibicon  of  their 
Complaint?  may  be  taken  as  the  Acte  of  the  Courte  Complayninge,  not 
iudginge,  for  they  acknowledg  the  iudgm*  to  belonge  to  Yo'  Comissioners 
but  iffl  the  impleadinge  to  belonge  to  the  body  of  the  Company.  For  by 
Yo"'  Ma**^  gratious  graunt  in  Yo''  Ma*^  Ires  Patent?  they  are  in  expresse 
Word?  made  a  Corporacon  and  to  be  Called  by  the  name  of  the  Treasuror 
and  Companie  of  Adventurers  and  Planters  of  the  Cittie  of  London  for 
the  first  Colony  in  Virginia  and  by  that  name  enabled  to  pleade  and  to 
be  unpleaded  as  all  other  Corporacons  are;  The  Company  therefore 
havinge  never  had  Cause  to  thinck  that  Yo''  Ma*^  pleasure  is  to  take 
away  this  originall  and  essentiall  libertie  by  Yo''  Ma*^  said  gratious  Ires 
Patent?  graunted  to  them.  Cannot  conceive  that  Yo'  Ma*'''  meaneth 
that  if  the  Vnited  body  of  the  Companie  haue  received  wronge  they  may 


208  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

not  alsoe  psecute  the  lawe  against  such  as  haue  done  the  same  whether 
he  be  an  Accomptant  to  them,  or  haue  robbed  piUed  or  defrauded  them 
in  their  substance,  or  done  them  any  other  iniurie  aswell  as  any  other  Cor- 
poracon  or  private  pson  may  doe  though  the  Word^  of  Yo'  Mat<^  said  Ire  to 
the  greate  greife  of  Yo'  Peticoners  seeme  to  importe  the  Contrary.  But 
for  such  iniuries  as  any  private  man  shall  pitend  to  haue  beene  done 
him  it  was  never  intended  to  psecute  them  in  the  name  of  the  body  of  the 
Companie;  but  to  leave  them  to  theire  seu9all  private  Complaints. 
For  they  conceive  it  not  to  be  accordinge  to  lawe  either  for  the  Com- 
pani[e]  to  foUowe  private  mens  Causes  in  the  name  of  their  body,  nor  for 
any  privat  man  or  men  to  psecute  in  his  or  theire  owne  names  the  causes 
of  the  Corporacon. 

Knowinge  it  therefore  to  be  agreeable  to  Yo'  Ma*^  iust  and  gratious 
purpose  that  both  parties  finde  the  like  indifference  of  tryall  and  aseured 
that  it  is  tendinge  to  Yo"^  Ma*^  pious  ends  that  abuses  on  all  sides  Where 
they  are  to  be  found  should  be  discou9ed  that  soe  they  may  be  alsoe  re- 
formed; Yo'  Suppl*^  most  humbly  beseech  Yo''  most  gratious  Ma'"'' 
(Consideringe  that  the  one  partie  is  the  vnited  body  of  the  Company  and 
the  other  partie  a  very  fewe  private  psons  wii  never  appeared  to  exceede 
sixe  and  twenty  in  nomber  and  not  aboue  foure  or  five  of  them  at  the  most 
that  wee  knowe  that  haue  for  theis  last  foure  yeares  brought  either  money 
or  Councell  to  the  Accon,  and  the  rest  of  them  especially  the  principall 
beinge  those  against  whome  the  Companie  most  Complayne)  that  the  said 
body  may  psecute  theire  iuste  and  greate  greifS  in  such  sorte  as  it  is  only

The  examinations  of  Cap'  Isack  Madeson  touchinge  the  supposed  con- 
tract betweene  M'  Grivell  Pooley  and  M''''  Sysley  Jordan,  taken  before 
S'  Francis  Wyatt  Knight  Governo9  and  Cap'  generall  of  Virginia:  S"" 
George  Yeardley  knight,  M'  George  Sandys  Esq9  Treasuro9,  D':  John 
Pott,  Cap'  Roger  Smyth,  Cap'  Raph  Hamor,  and  M"  John  Pountis.  one 
the  4"'  of  June  1623. 

Cap'  Isack  Maddeson  Sworne  and  examined  saith  that  (as  neare  as  he 
remembreth)  the  first  Motion  made  to  him  by  M"'  Grivell  Pooley,  touchinge 
a  match  w'h  M''"  Jordan,  was  about  three  or  foure  dayes  after  M''  Jordans 
death,  who  entreating  this  examinant  to  moue  the  matter  to  her,  he 
answered  he  was  unwillinge  to  medle  in  any  such  bussines;  but  beinge 


JUNE  4,  NOVEMBER  17,  1623  219 

vrged  by  him,  he  did  moue  it:  M"  Jordan  rephed  that  she  would  as  will- 
ingly haue  hun  as  any  other,  but  shee  would  not  Ma§r§ry  any  man  vntill 
she  was  deliued.  After  this  M"'  Pooley  (having  had  some  private  talke 
w'h  M"  Jordan)  tould  this  examinant  that  he  had  contracted  himself 
vnto  her,  and  desired  him  and  his  wife  to  be  witnesses  of  it,  wherevppon 
M'  Pooley  desiring  a  drain  of  M"  Jordan,  and  shee  bidding  her  servant 
fetch  it)  said  he  wold  have  it  of  her  fetchinge,  or  not  at  all:  then  she  went 
into  a  roome,  and  this  examinant  and  M'  Pooley  went  to  her,  but  whether 
she  were  privy  to  his  intent  this  examinant  knoweth  not:  when  M'  Pooley 
was  come  to  her,  he  told  her  he  would  contract  himself  vnto  her,  and 
spake  these  words.  I  Grivell  Pooley,  take  thee  Sysley,  to  my  wedded 
wife,  to  haue,  and  to  hold,  till  death  vs  depart,  and  thereto  I  plight  thee 
my  troth.  Then  (holding  her  by  the  hand)  he  spake  these  words  I 
Sysley,  take  thee  Grivell,  to  my  wedded  husband,  to  haue,  and  to  hold, 
till  death  vs  depart:  but  this  examinant  heard  not  her  say  any  of  those 
words,  neither  doth  he  remember  that  M''  Pooley  asked  her  whether  she 
did  consent  to  those  words  or  that  shee  did  answer  any  thinge  w^'h  he 
vnd9stood,  then  M'  Pooley  and  shee  dranke  each  to  other,  and  lie  kissed 
her,  and  spake  these  words,  I  am  thine  and  thou  art  mine  till  death  vs 
seperate.  M"  Jordan  then  desired  that  it  might  not  be  revealed  that  shee 
did  so  soone  bestow  her  loue,  after  her  husbands  death;  wherevppon  M'' 
Pooley  protested  before  God  that  he  wold  not  reveale  it,  till  she  thought 
the  time  fittinge.

taken  before  S'  Francis  Wyatt  Knight  Governo''  &c  and  Chr:  Davison 
Seer:  the  17"'  of  November  1623. 

Mary  Maddeson  Sworne  and  examined  saith,  that  she  was  not  p]sent  at  the 
makeinge  of  the  supposed  contract  betweene  M''  Pooley  and  M"  Jordan, 
but  she  heard  M"  Jordan  say  if  M"^  Pooley  had  not  revealed  it  he  might 
haue  fared  the  bett[er]  and  saith  further  that  her  husband  told  her  that 
night,  that  M"  Jordan  had  made  her  self  sure  to  M'  Pooley,  but  what 
words  passed  her  husband  did  not  perticulerly  repeate,  but  spake  of  theire 
drinkinge  each  to  other,  and  of  M'  Pooleys  salutinge  her

John  Harris  Sworne  and  examined  saith  that  he  heard  M"  Jordan  say 
that  M''  Pooley  nuglit  thanke  himself,  for  he  might  haue  fared  the  better 
but  for  his  owne  words. 

This  Woman  before  AP  Grivell  Pooley  called  her  into  the  Court,  con-

Right  Honorable 

The  Kinge,  the  State,  tlie  plantacion,  and  my  poore  selfe,  will  all  have 
cause  to  thank  you  for  procureing  this  Commission.  Expedition  will  nowe 
bee  the  life  of  it,  That  it  may  be  putt  into  accion,  by  Bartholmew  day, 
else  this  yeare  will  bee  lost  as  the  last  yeare  was;  your  Lordship  hath 
tendered  the  importacion  of  the  Spanish  Tobacco  to  the  Companie,  they 
(as  they  doe  all  thinges  els)  applie  it  to  the  benefitt  of  a  few,  for  want  of  a 
Stock.  I  make  noe  doubt  but  if  this  Commission  be  expediated,  but  there 
wilbe  a  Stock  prociu'ed  time  enough  to  farme  the  Tobacco  for  the  publique 
soe  as  the  benefitt  gayned  shall  returne  to  the  good  of  the  Kinge,  and  the 
plantacion.  Good  my  Lord  in  all  your  grauntes  that  carrie  profitt  with 
them,  use  the  name  of  the  Publique;  The  word  Companie  governed  by 
populer  voices,  is  it  that  covereth  all  their  secrett  practises.  And  it  is  a 
shame  that  the  Common  weale  of  Virginia,  dependinge  on  the  Monarchic 
here,  should  be  governed  soe,  as  this  httle  treatise  here  inclosed  will  show 
you.  All  the  examples  that  I  produce  to  expresse  the  injuries  done,  were 
for  the  most  part  in  Sir  Thomas  Smith's  goverment,  because  from  it  the 
planters  have  learned  their  inhumanitie  and  injustice  which  they  nowe  use, 
both  against  the  new  comers  and  adventurers,  offeringe  the  same  measure 
which  hath  bene  measured  before  to  them.  But  if  I  should  call  in  question 
the  present  governors,  whoe  beinge  not  ignorant  that  the  populer  goverment 
doth  directlie  take  away  the  power  of  the  monarchie  and  shew  what 
mischeife  they  have  done  by  their  profuse  throwinge  out  libertie,  amongst 
the  planters,  whereby  they  have  made  them  forsake  their  former  discipline, 
strength  and  vertue  to  defend  themselves  against  the  domestick  enemie, 
and  yet  beinge  fore  warned  of  these  thinges  it  should  appeare  that  they  did 
it  knoweingely  and  wittinglie  against  the  soveraignitie  in  England,  extreame 
libertie  beinge  worse  then  extreame  Tirranie,  as  it  appeared  by  the  troubles

people  endure  and  not  least  Hunger  in  wii  th'  Indians  also  suffer  extreame. 

The  Company  agreed  w'h  Capt  Each  (M""  of  th'  Abigaile)  for  erecting  of 
a  Fort  vpon  the  Oister  bankes:  but  it  pleased  God  to  call  him  away  pres- 
ently after  his  coming  and  I  feare  he  vnderstood  not  the  place  where  theT'ie  fort  giuen 
intent  was  to  build  it:  for  vpon  triall  it  prooued  a  loose  false  grounde," 
beside  the  Capt  beeing  dead  there  was  none  left  that  would  certainlie 
vndertake  it  or  couenant  to  pforme  it  in  any  reasonable  tyme.  So  we 
resolued  to  dismiss  the  Ship  (lying  at  160"  a  month)  and  w'h  o''  land  men 
(leauying  euery  xx%  man  towards  the  Worke)  vnder  the  Com''  of  Capt 
Roger  Snnjth  who  lined  12  or  13  yeares  in  the  Warrs  in  the  low  Countrcyes 
to  build  a  blockhouse  vpon  the  Shoare  where  we  might  as  well  coinand 
shipping  and  w'hall  haue  a  strong  Plantacon  the  ground  beeing  rich  and 
good:  This  will  at  least  giue  a  begining  to  what  may  he  done  hereafter 
of  greater  consequence.

Prouision  w'=h  was  only  a  bushell  of  Meale  to  keepe  me  and  my  familie 
from  this  tyme  till  Haruest  but  could  haue  no  releife,  only  the  Threar  bad 
me  pray /or  the  speedie  arriuall  of  the  Seaflowcr,  &  if  she  bring  in  any  Meale 
I  shall  haue  some  payi7ig  for  it  All  my  Son  in  lawes  corne  was  brought 
vp  to  James  Towne  &  I  cannot  gett  a  grayne  of  it  to  releiue  my  need 
though  I  produced  a  Bill  of  18''  sterl  w^h  he  owed  me:  Great  men  are 
payed,  but  poore  7nen  imist  bide  the  loss:  yet  I  dare  not  complaine  for  feare  of 
worse,  seeing  Virginia  is  gouerned  whollie  by  S'  Edwyn  Sandys  his  faction: 
I  desire  therefore  to  come  to  London  to  shew  how  all  thingC  are  carryed, 
whereby  I  hope  to  procure  Reformacon:  Yo"  are  both  wise  &  charitable 
w^h  will  make  yo"  to  shew  these  lines  but  to  those  that  yo"  know  vnpartiall 
and  speciallie  to  S'  Jo  Worsenholme:  The  last  cutting  of  Of  Cap*  Spillman 
hath  giuen  vs  a  great  check:  The  most  euident  hope  from  altogether  staruing 
is  Oysters  and  for  the  easier  getting  of  them  I  haue  agreed  for  a  Canow  w'=h 
will  cost  me  vj"  ster9:  My  hope  for  silke  is  greater  then  eu9  if  I  can 
bring  it  home.

Who  is  in  the  fault  I  know  not  for  I  was  not  there  but  I  will  tell  yo"  once 
more  that  vnles  strict  Orders  be  sent  from  Engl  for  preseruacon  of  Mul- 
berry Trees  the  silke  worke  will  whollie  be  lost  for  a  great  while  in  Virginia: 
Our  Wormes  are  well  hatched  &  very  hopefull:  if  I  hue  I  will  bring  home 
some  silke:  My  coming  into  Engl  will  doe  great  good  for  this  Contrey, 
as  well  by  my  good  report  thereof  as  for  some  small  &  easie  meanes  w'^h 
I  will  shew  the  Com  panic  for  the  easier  hatching  of  the  wormes  then  yet 
hath  ben  found  here  or  in  England  &  for  very  small  charges:  I  say  if  I 
liue  for  I  haue  not  at  this  tyme  to  maynteine  me  &  my  people  till  Haruest 
but  a  little  more  then  halfe  a  bushell  of  English  Meale  all  my  Prouision  beeing

Arundle  will  follow  the  silke  worke  for  I  find  him  very  fitt  for  it,  therefore 
I  entreate  yo"  if  I  dye  before  I  see  yo"  to  take  notice  of  him  &  to  deale 
charitablie  w*h  my  yong  Children:  All  th'  euident  meanes  we  haue  to  /me^^^*®"

I  offer  to  pay  for  it:  Notwithstanding  I  referr  myselfe  to  the  Lord^  will

is  nothing  but  to  deuoure  the  food  of  the  land  without  dooing  any  dayes

As  for  the  Incouraging  men  to  come  ouer  in  my  opinion  better  meaiics  may 
be  vsed  then  by  putting  them  in  vayne  hopes  w''h  some  lying  Virginians 
vse  to  doe  thinking  they  doe  much  good  thereby  when  indeed  if  rightly 
considered  they  are  not  only  the  cheife  causers  of  their  deathes  thereby

miserably  som  [4]  of  them  at  their  last  cursing  them  most  bitterly  that 
sent  them  ou9,  &  pswading  them  of  the  plenty  aforesd  w^h  they  should 
find.  For  all  this  plenty  the  poore  Tenants  would  think  themselues  happy 
if  they  had  but  Butter  &  Cheese  vppon  Festiuall  dayes. 

I  need  not  certifie  in  what  nombers  the  Companyes  Tenants  dye,  the 
proffitt^  that  come  in  to  them  may  sufficiently  testifie:  Yet  thus  mucli  A-i)pon

that  we  were  so  full  of  infection  that  after  a  while  we  saw  little  but  throwing

May  it  please  yC  most  excellent  Ma'''' 

Wee  received  a  significaciou  of  yo"'  Ma"'"'  pleasure  from  the  lords  of  your 
most  honorable  privy  counsell  touching  two  poynt^  which  concerne  the 
Virginia  company. 

The  one  that  wee  should  take  knowledg  from  them  what  hath  bene  done 
by  them  for  the  relief  of  the  present  distres  of  yo''  subiect^  in  Virginia 
according  to  the  proposicions  and  offers  made  by  them  att  the  Counsell 
board  and  withall  to  signifie  to  them  that  they  were  speedily  to  pform  the 
same  att  theyr  pill 

The  other  to  take  into  our  consideracions  the  sev'^all  letters  patents  granted 
to  that  company  and  the  reports  concerning  the  same  lately  made  by  yo"' 
Maiesties  Commission"  and  therevpon  certifie  our  opinions  to  yo'  Ma"" 
concerning  the  Resuming  of  that  gov''nmet. 

ffor  the  first  wee  sent  for  the  deputy  and  three  or  fower  others  of  the  com- 
pany whom  wee  acquainted  w*h  yo''  Ma""''  pleasure  and  within  two  or 
three  dales  after  wee  received  from  themselves  a  particular  account  in 
writing  which  wee  humbly  send  to  yo"'  Ma""  herevnto  annexed. 

ffor  the  other  wee  have  diligently  pvsed  the  severall  Ires  patents  and 
advisedly  comparing  them  and  the  sev''all  clauses  of  them  together  and 
w*h  the  certificates  of  the  commissioners  wee  conceave  that  for  the  apparent 
abuses  and  miscariage  in  the  plantation  and  government  and  for  some 
defects  also  in  the  patent^  themselves  yo''  Ma"'^  if  yow  so  please  may  iustly 
resume  that  govrnment  and  order  and  dispose  of  it  in  such  other  manner 
as  in  yo'  wisedome  yow  shall  fynd  best  for  tlie  good  of  the  plantation. 


25G  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

But  for  the  manner  because  the  resuming  of  theyr  privilege  in  a  legall 
course  must  be  the  worke  of  tyme  and  the  distresse  of  yo'  Ma'"'"^  subiectC 
in  that  colony  (as  seemeth  by  the  coinission"  certificates)  doth  necessarily 
require  more  expedicion  wee  humbly  offer  it  to  yo"'  Ma''"^  iudgment  whether 
yow  will  not  think  it  fitt  in  a  case  of  this  nature  according  to  the  p''sident 
in  the  case  of  the  marchant  adventurers  by  yo'  Ma''"^  royall  proclamacion 
to  conunand  the  forbearans  of  the  execucion  of  those  Ires  patent?  and  of 
the  authority  thereby  given  and  coiTiitted  vnto  them  And  that  then  if 
the  company  shall  [2]  not  vpon  consideracio  of  theyr  owne  weaknes 
voluntarily  yeld  vp  theyr  privelegC  there  may  be  a  legall  pceeding  against 
them  for  calling  in  the  same. 

But  seeing  it  is  yo"'  good  pleasure  not  to  avoyd  the  private  interest?  of  any 
of  yo'  subiect?  which  have  bene  adventurers  either  in  parson  or  purse  wee 
conceive  and  humbly  offer  it  also  to  yo'  Ma*'*^^  iudgment  that  for  avoyding 
the  inconveniens  which  may  ensue  by  suspension  of  the  present  governmet 
vntill  a  better  be  resolved  on  it  wilbe  fitt  that  yo'  Maiestie  first  determin 
of  that  way  which  yow  shall  think  best  to  establish  for  the  government  of 
that  colony  before  yow  publish  yo'  intention  by  proclamacion  or  otherwise 
and  then  att  the  same  instant  yo'  subiect?  may  have  knowledg  both  of  the 
necessity  of  this  alteracion  and  of  yo'  grace  to  the  adventurers  in  settling 
and  vpholding  theyr  private  interest?  All  w'h  wee  do  most  humbly 
submitt  to  yo'  owne  good  pleasure  and  i)rincely  direction

Answere  to  the  propositions  made  by  the  Right  Honorable  the  Lord 
Chichester  for  the  bcnofitt  ef  *he  better  setUng  of  the  plantation  in  Virginia. 

1.  The  places  w%  wore  antientlie  §best§  fortified  were  the  Cities  of  Henrico 
and  Charles  w^h  are  now  vtterlie  demolished  by  th'Indians:  And  the 
fortifications  about  James  Citie  &  Elizabeth  Citie  a#e  §haue  ben§  suffered 
by  the  Colony e  of  late  to  grow  to  such  decay  that  they  tel-fe  aak  are  become 
of  no  strength  or  vse  so  that  as  to  the  first  point  the  truth  is  That  at  this 
tjrme  there  are  no  places  fortified  for  defence  &  safetie  for  the  Access  of 
Shipping  from  the  Sea  and  Boates  vppon  the  Riuers. 

2.  There  are  diuerse  small  plantacons  all  seated  vppon  the  Riuers  sides  aftd 
accessible  hy  Boates,  and  before  most  of  them  Shipps  of  3  ef  St)  aboue  200 
Tun  may  lyde:  But  §the  plantacons  are  farr  asunder  &§  their  houses  ^m 
scattcfe  standi  scattered  one  from  another,  and  arc  onlie  made  of  wood, 
few  or  none  of  them  beeing  framed  houses  but  punches  sett  do  into  tlie 
Ground  And  coucred  w*h  Boards  so  as  a  firebrand  is  sufficient  to  consume 
them  all. 

3.  The  Cities  of  Henrico  &  Charles  stood  vpon  high  ground  the  Cliffes 
beeing  steepe.  Astd  but  of  a  claye  mould  &  yet  §&§  the  ayre  good  and 
wholesome.  Aftd  §Also  about  those  places§  good  quantities  of  cleared 
grounds  97bo«t  these  #we  Towncs:  but  all  the  land  generallie  is  ouergrowne 
v/*h  great  Timber  Trees  so  that  there  is  little  or  no  land  fitt  for  §present§ 
culture  but  what,  is  §what§  by  Industrie  is  cleared  of  the  wood  er  either  by 
the  Colony  §English§  or  tfe  by  th'Indians. 

4.  The  fortifications  antientlie  vsed  were  by  Trench  and  Pallizado  ¥r''h  ftew 
ftfe  ftli  gefte  te  ruyne  and  diuerse  blockhouses  made  of  Tfrfflber  great

5.  The  lands  where  the  CoIon3^e!3  §Townes§  are  seated  §doe  not  for  ought 
is  knowne§  affoord  fte*  stone  for  building  nor  limestone  for  Mortar.  But 
there  are  good  store  of  Shells  about  Elizabeth  Citie  w'h  will  make 
very  good  lyme  and  may  by  water  be  easilie  transported  to  the  seuerall 
plantacons 

6.  In  most  places  and  pticularlie  about  Henrico  &  Charles  Citie  the  Sodds 
are  §very§  good  to  fortifie  w%all  especiallie  if  they  be  cutt  in  the  sedgie 
ground  w^h  is  so  full  of  Rootes  that  it  bind?  the  earth  close  and  keepes  it 
from  falling  in  peices 

7.  It  is  very  necessarie  to  rayse  new  workes  especiallie  at  Henrico  & 
Charles  Citie  Wh  by  reason  of  their  situation  may  be  stronglie  fortified, 
and  are  most  comodious  for  habitation  in  regard  of  the  wholesomnes  of  th' 
aire,  access  of  Shipping,  &  store  of  cleared  ground?  [2]  but  it  is  not  knowne 
that  there  are  men  of  experience  in  the  Countrie  fitt  to  direct  those  workes. 

8.  There  is  good  store  of  earth  fitt  to  make  Ijrick  almost  in  euery  place; 
And  heretofore  much  Brick  hath  ben  made  in  the  Contrie  Aftd  i*  we^e 
would  cxoocdinglie  both  strengthen  fmd  beautific  -the  plantacons  if  they 
§pcoplc§  were  cnioynetl  ^e  make  ftH  t4w^if  l)uildingg  thereof 

9.  This  is  a  very  good  direccon  And  it  would  much  exceedinglie  both 
strengthen  and  beautifie  the  plantation  if  ofte  Towne  wefe  some  convenient 
number  of  houses  were  built  §together§  of  Brick  and  enclosed  w'h  a  brick 
wall  that  might  deserue  the  name  of  a  Towne:  one  of  these  at  Henrico 
(w'h  is  the  fittest  place  of  all)  and  another  at  the  place  now  called  Charles 
Cittie:  But  this  must  be  pformed  at  the  publiqj  charge  for  the  pooFe 
miserable  people  that  are  now  there  doe  ftfe  doe  onlie  worke  for  themselues 
&  their  pticular  owners  and  are  so  miserablie  poore  that  all  they  can  rayse 
by  their  priuate  labour  is  hardlie  sufficient  to  find  them  Corne  to  preserue 
them  from  staruing,  and  to  plant  some  Tobacco  to  find  them  clothes:  So 
that  vnlcfj  the^e  were  some  vntill  there  be  some  reasonable  nomber  of  men 
w^'h  maynteined  ©ftly  by  §at§  the  charge  of  the  Companie  only  to  imploy 
their  tyme  *e  worke  f©f  §in§  publirj,  workes,  it  is  there  is  small  hope  that 
the  plantacon  will  be  brought  vnto  any  good  pass:  For  as  the  case  now 
stand?  if  a  man  be  taken  from  his  priuate  labour  but  for  a  day  or  two  he  it

1.  It  is  very  necessarie  that  it  be  examined  he  whether  the  direccon  giuen

doubted  the  pulsions  w^h  she  carryes  will  hardlie  be  sufficient  for  those  pa

After  o''  very  hartie  Comendations 

Our  last  vnto  yo"  were  by  the  Bonny  Bess,  by  w"""  Shipp  also  the  Lord^  of

proceeding^  therein  not  haueing  yet  come  to  any  conclusion  that  we  know 
of,  wherefore  as  til  then  we  must  be  silent,  so  we  hartely  pray  yo"  in  the

shall  heare,  but  to  go  on  w'^  vnity,  courage  and  constancie,  in  that  great 
worke  comitted  vnto  yo";  to  the  advancement  whereof  (we  doubt  not  but) 
this  Comission  will  in  the  end  much  conduce,  according  to  the  Royall 
intention  of  his  Ma"^  declared  in  the  Institucon  thereof;  vppon  w'=''  we 
are  confident  and  so  desire  that  yo"  rest,  being  assured  (w"''  by  many 
admirable  examples  we  haue  found)  that  as  this  enterprise  of  the  Plan- 
tacon,  hath  beene  cheefly  in  o"'  intencons,  so  it  is  in  the  acceptacon  of  God, 
a  work  especially  destined  for  his  bono''  and  service,  and  therefore  shall  in 
the  end  prosper  and  come  to  pfeccon;  In  the  hope  whereof  and  the  testi- 
mony of  o''  owne  consciences,  to  haue  w*''  all  sincerity  of  intencon  and 
indeavo''^  pformed  the  vttermost  of  o'  abilities,  we  are  much  comforted 
amid^  those  sorows  w""  w"''  we  are  deeply  touched,  vppon  consideration  of 
the  mortallity  scarcitie  &  discomfortablenes,  w''''  we  vnd'stand  to  be 
amongst  yo";  for  the  first,  and  last,  we  can  giue  no  other  lielpe  then  o' 
humblest  prayers  to  the  devine  Ma''°,  nor  other  Counsell,  then  that  w'*' 
true  repentance  and  pfect  amendment  of  life,  j^o"  labo''  to  apease  the  wrath 
of  God,  that  burneth  so  fiercely:  But  for  relief  of  the  scarscity  and  great 
want?  W''  by  some  private  mens  letters,  sent  home  in  the  Abigail,  was 
expressed  to  be  in  the  highest  degree  of  extremity:  as  soone  as  we  had 
notice  thereof  from  the  Lord?  of  the  Privy  Counsell,  although  we  were 
verie  confident  that  err  the  supply  could  ariue  from  hence,  yo"  would  be 
abundantly  stored  by  a  plentifull  harvest,  yet  for  the  declaration  of  o' 
tend'  care  and  zeale  for  yo",  whereof  not  only  the  Lord?,  but  his  Ma"^  him- 
self (as  we  from  them  vnd'stood)  was  in  his  Princely  mind  much  solicitous; 
we  procured  an  vnd''writeing  of  700'  to  be  sent  in  Meal  by  way  of  a  Maga- 
zine; as  for  all  other  Comodities  we  found  by  the  vnd'takeing  of  private 
psons,  yo"  would  be  supplied  even  to  supfluity:  of  this  supply  of  Meale, 
there  goeth  along  in  this  Shipp  the  George  about  40  hogshead?  the  rest 
imediatly  follow  in  the  Hopwell  and  Marmaduke,  w*''  m''  John  Hart  whom 
the  Adventurers  send  ouer  the  Cape-Marchant  thereof;  but  if  the  George 
ariue  before  his  comeinge  they  intreat  m''  Blany  to  take  care  thereof  vntill 
m"'  Harts  arivall,  and  in  case  m''  Hart  should  miscarie,  they  do  consigne 
both  this  and  the  rest  of  the  Meale  that  shall  foUowe,  to  m"'  Blany,  to  be 
by  him  sould  to  theire  best  profitt,  and  the  proceed  thereof,  together  w'** 
the  account  to  be  returned  vnto  them  by  the  first.  Two  great  difficulties 
we  found  in  compassinge  this  kind  of  supply:  the  first  a  coiuon  hope,  that 
the  plenty  of  the  New  harvest,  whereof  through  yo"'  promises  there  was 


264  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

raised  a  generall  confidence,  would  make  it  needles;  the  other,  the  extreme 
high  rate  that  good  corne  doth  here  at  ]5!sent  beare,  w'^''  though  it  should 
come  opportunely,  would  make  it  vnwelcome;  yet  hath  the  zeale  of  yo' 
welfare,  and  feare  of  leaving  yo"  to  any  doubtfull  extreamity,  overcome 
all  private  interest,  in  the  miiid^  of  these  noble  and  worthie  Adventurers; 
w'^''  as  we  w'*"  much  thankfullnes  for  yo'  sakes  here  acknowledg,  so  we 
think  yo"  bound  w"'  all  gratfullnes  to  accept,  and  to  show  and  yeeld  not 
only  all  due  Justice,  but  all  possible  favo',  vnto  theire  facto"  that  a  speedy 
and  profitable  returne  of  these  Adventurers  may  be  made  them. 
Wee  here  inclosed  send  yo"  the  Roll  of  Subscription,  esteeming  the  names 
themselues  will  effectually  pswade  yo",  and  the  whole  Colony,  to  conceaue 
of  theire  mind^  as  *  *  *  and  to  endeavo'  theire  iust  desires,  as  we 
wish,  by  a  full  retribution:  we  haue  *  *  *  accompt  of  what  it  standC 
in  p  bushell,  to  be  sent  yo",  W^'  we  desire  yo"  to  make  knowne  to  the  Colony, 
and  w**"  all  that  Tobacco  doth  not  here  cleare  one  w**"  another  xx''.  a  pound, 
nor  any  likelyhood  that  it  will  mend  in  prize;  wherefore  we  pray  yo"  first 
to  sattisfie  yo''  owne  mindC,  and  then  others,  that  by  theire  true  valuation 
of  Comodities,  we  here  may  be  freed  from  those  vniust  and  most  vndeserved 
taxacons  of  oppression,  w""  w''*'  we  are  scandalized,  of  selling  Meale  in 
Virginia  at  thirty  shilling^  p  bushell,  because  for  x'*  of  tobacco,  when 
as  truly  by  account  offred  vnto  vs  vppon  oath,  we  are  certaine  that  the 
Meale  sent  the  last  yeare  stood  in  aboue  12'  p  bushell,  and  the  1500  waight 
of  Tobacco  returned  hither  vppon  that  accompt  by  m"'  Blany  is  at  this 
ptsent  offered  to  be  sould  for  3"  the  pound,  when  the  Custome,  fraight  & 
other  charges,  together  w*""  the  wast,  being  deducted,  there  will  not  remaine 
at  the  most  aboue  IS''  p^:  so  that  the  greatest  gaine  that  can  be  hoped  is 
25  p  Centu,  a  gaine  to  high  indeed  in  a  certaine  and  orderly  kind  of  trade; 
but  this  is  accompanied  both  by  Sea  and  land  w"'  so  many  hazards,  and 
is  spunn  out  to  such  a  length  of  time  before  the  Store  be  returned,  that 
none  here  wilbe  pswaded  to  adventure  vppon  those  tearmes,  in  whom  the 
desire  of  yo'  good,  is  not  more  strong  then  of  theire  owne  profitt. 

As  for  the  last  yeares  Magazine  by  how  much  the  paine  and  loue  in  procur- 
inge  was  more  extraordinary  and  the  losse  that  hapned  in  the  Sumer 
Ileand^  the  greater,  by  so  much  the  more  do  we  earnestly  intreat  yo' 
assistance  and  favo'  to  m""  Blany  if  he  shall  need  it,  for  the  recovery  of  the 
debt^  vppon  that  Magazine,     w**"  the  same  care  we  recomend  likewise  vnto 


AUGUST  6,  162S  265 

yo"  that  former  Magazine  sent  in  the  Warwick,  w"*"  being  of  neare  2000' 
and  two  yeares  time  now  past,  there  hath  been  by  m'^  Blany  returned  not 
2000  waight:  wee  are  moved  thus  pticulerly  to  recomend  these  bussinesses, 
considering,  that  although  the  interest  be  of  private  men,  yet  the  conse- 
quence is  of  most  publique  good,  or  evill,  to  the  Colony:  Besides  in  these 
two  there  is  due  from  yo"  S''  Francis  Wyatt,  and  yo"  m""  George  Sandis  a 
pticuler  and  especiall  care,  in  regard  that  as  vppon  yo'  faith  and  security, 
the  last  yeares  Magazine  was  sent;  so  the  first  that  went  along  w**"  you,  was 
in  the  greatest  part  adventured  vppon  confidence  that  yo"'  supintendent 
care  should  not  be  wanting  to  cause  a  due  and  profitable  returne;  wherefore 
in  the  Adventurers  names  we  very  especially  recomend  them  vnto  yo". 
And  although  they  do  no  way  suspect  the  integritie  of  m"^  Blany,  yet  being 
much,  and  iustly  as  we  conceaue  offended  that  he  hath  not  at  least  sent 
home  the  accounts,  w""^  by  how  much  the  returnes  were  the  slacker  and 
poorer  ought  to  haue  beene  don  the  more  exactly  &  fully  they  haue  besought 
vs  to  desire  yo"  to  require  of  him  a  pfect  account,  of  what  he  hath  sold, 
what  he  hath  remaninge,  and  what  Tobacco  or  debt^  are  in  his  hand  due 
vnto  them  vppon  these  accounts,  w'=''  accomptC  they  desire  may  be  deliu''ed 
vnto  m'  John  Hart,  who  is  to  return  w*''  them,  and  the  goodC  themselues, 
w'*"  the  first  opportunity:  but  of  these  tliingC  theire  private  instruccons 
and  Comissions  will  further  advise  yo";  we  haue  desended  to  this  pticuler 
at  theire  instant  request,  in  regard  that  they  suppose  that  this  o''  publique 
recoinendacon  wilbe  a  warrant  vnto  yo",  w""  lesse  offence,  for  pformance  of 
strict  iustice  where  it  shalbe  needfull  in  the  recoverie  of  debtC:  and  on  m'' 
Blany  it  imposeth  a  necessitie  not  to  spare  any  since  if  he  would  he  cannot; 
w"''  conduceing  so  much  to  the  end  w''''  he  faithfully  promised  the  benefitt 
of  the  Aduentures,  we  conceaue  he  cannot  but  be  gladd  of;  and  we  haue 
willingly  therefore  thus  donn;  besides  as  it  is  o"'  desire,  so  it  is  the  Aduen- 
tures offer  that  both  theire  accounts  in  Virginia  and  here,  should  be  opne 
and  knowne  of  all,  that  y"  fairnes  and  sincerity  of  theire  Intencions  might 
be  evident  by  the  smalnes  of  the  gaine  they  proposed  vnto  themselues, 
and  the  constancie  of  theire  loue  in  the  continuance  of  Supplies  after  so 
many  and  great  losses. 

The  Adventurers  that  sent  the  Maid^  desire  likewise  o''  recomendacon  of 
the  bussines  vnto  m'  Pountis,  from  whom  they  hope  the  full  return  this 
yeare,  w"''  we  earnestly  desire,  tliat  it  may  in  the  same,  or  some  other 


266  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

profitable  maner  he  readventured.  The  ffurr-Adventurers  by  the  wick- 
ednes  of  the  Captaine  and  Mariners  is  quite  oirthrowne;  wherefore  we 
desire  the  Addition  of  yo"'  care,  in  the  Glass,  and  Shippwright?,  that 
thereby  some  pte  of  amende  may  be  made  if  possible;  for  the  last  it  was 
the  most  costly  and  chargeable  that  we  ever  vnd'took  and  therefore,  we 
most  especially  recomend  it  vnto  yo"  all,  and  in  pticuler  vnto  m""  George 
Sandis.  And  whereas  m'  John  Ferrar  besides  his  large  Adventure  therein 
is  engaged  200',  therevppon  we  cannot  but  add  o''  publique  request  vnto 
yo",  since  both  his  mind  and  the  benefitt  it  self  were  so  publique,  that  the 
proceed  of  theire  labo"  w''*'  we  cannot  thinke  but  to  be  good  (howsoeuer 
much  empaired  by  the  losse  of  so  many  principall  men)  may  be  carefully 
collected  and  returned  to  him  by  the  first. 

This,  and  the  rest  of  these  bussinesses,  we  haue  thus  pticulerly  and  largly 
touched  now,  not  that  we  doubt  yo''  best  endeavo"  of  iustice,  care,  and 
favo",  would  haue  beene  otherwise  wanting,  haueinge  beene  so  often  for- 
merly recomended  vnto  yo",  and  in  theire  owne  nature  deserving  it  so 
much:  but  that  we  think  it  o'  dutie  w"'  as  much  care  to  solicitt  the  retri- 
bution from  yo",  as  we  did  w**"  desire  importune  the  Adventur"  from 
hence  for  yo". 

The  advancement  of  Staple  Comodities,  we  haue  so  often  and  so  largely 
written  of,  that  we  haue  now  nothing  to  add,  but  that  exept  there  be  some 
speedy  pformance,  by  the  settinge  vpp  of  some  better  Comoditie  then 
Tobacco,  neither  can  we  hope  for  the  encrease  of  the  Plantation,  nor 
may  yo"  there  already  expect  subsistance,  so  vilde  will  the  prise  of  that 
weed  be  vppon  the  great  gluttC  of  the  next  yeare,  w'^'*  as  we  assure  o' 
selues  will  bring  in  foure  times  the  quantities,  will  likewise  abate  aboue 
half  the  prise. 

The  Vines  and  Silk  are  in  yo''  owne  powers  powers  to  effect,  and  we  hope  a 
good  entrie  hath  beene  made  into  them,  according  to  yo''  promise,  whereof 
if  we  may  see  some  [29]  fruite  as  we  hope  to  do  this  returne,  it  wilbe  a 
grreat  repaire  not  only  to  o"  and  yo'  credi[tt]  but  to  the  bono'  of  the 
Plantation,  w""''  hath  much  suffered  in  the  long  delay  of  these  so  pmised 
worke,  that  not  only  the  Maligners  of  this  Plantation,  but  even  diu"

and  o''  intentions  for  thejaccomplishing  of  them:  but  we  wish  and  hope 
that  some  reall  proof e  thereof  returned  from  yo",  shall  iustifie  both,  in 
assurance  whereof,  we  do  not  desire  yo"  to  begin,  but  to  continue  in  that 
yo"  haue  begunn,  and  in  an  effectuall  maner  to  prosecute  them;  by  a  generall 
setting  them  vpp  in  all  convenient  places,  by  a  strict  plserving  of  the 
Mulberie  trees,  that  they  be  not  wasted  (wherein  we  are  informed  there  is 
great  neglect ;)  by  an  exact  and  strict  account,  of  the  pformance  of  o"  and 
youre  Comand^  in  those  points;  by  the  encouraging  those  that  are 
forward  herein,  and  punishing  them  that  are  backward;  and  lastly  by  all 
possible  meanes  that  may  conduce  to  the  speedy  and  full  effectinge,  of 
these  two  great  workes.  And  whereas  the  ffrenchmen  are  they  on  whom, 
in  greatest  part,  the  progresse  of  these  depend;  we  especially  recomend 
them  vnto  yo"^  care  and  loue,  desiringe  that  theire  want^  of  apparell  and 
other  necessaries,  may  by  yo"  be  supplied  to  the  full,  out  of  the  Companies 
Stock  there;  and  whereas  there  covenanted  times  do  shortly  expire,  we 
pray  yo"  so  to  deale  w*""  them,  as  they  may  be  pswaded  to  continue,  if  not 
for  ever  yett  at  least  so  long,  vntill  theire  skill  and  knowledg  in  those 
things  may  be  deriued  into  such  numbers  of  o'  people,  as  may  be  sufficient 
for  a  large  imployment  in  those  work^.  And  in  this  thing  we  pray  yo"  to 
vse  yo''  best  care  and  wisdomes  considering  that  it  will  not  be  easie,  if  these 
men  return  discontented,  to  procure  others  from  theire  cuntrie,  neither  is 
it  indeed  possible  to  the  Company  now  extreamly  in  debt,  to  be  at  so  great 
charge  for  the  sending  anew  of  others,  as  these  men  came  to;  wherefore 
we  earnestly  pray  yo",  not  to  lett  the  occacon  and  meanes  in  yo'  handC 
to  slipp  away,  w"""  if  yo''  do  we  know  no  possibility  of  repairing  it;  yet 
would  we  not  haue  them  by  violence,  or  any  vniust  meanes  deteined  (w**" 
w"""  Gods  blessing  will  not  go  along)  but  by  faire  and  gentle  psuations,  and 
by  the  offer  of  so  beneficiall  coven^nt^  vnto  them,  as  they  may  rest  paid 
w'*",  and  yo"  be  certainly  able  to  pforme:  for  as  for  vs  here  at  home,  although 
we  are  not  out  of  hope  (haueing  verie  iust  and  due  ground  therefore)  in 
convenient  thne  to  raise  a  reasonable  Stock  of  money,  yet  till  we  may  see 
it  effected,  we  thinke  it  not  honorable  vppon  vncertainties,  to  engage  o' 
certaine  faith,  for  payments  in  this  kind;  wherefore  we  pray  so  to  contriue 
it,  as  theire  satisfacon  from  hereafter  may  arise  from  Virginia:  And  because 
vppon  o"'  contract  w""  them,  there  is  and  wilbe  a  great  Suine  due  vnto  them,

engaged,  whose  services  to  yo"  and  vs  haue  been  such,  as  this  (w'"''  yett 
none  other  dare  vnd''take)  is  of  the  least;  so  that  it  is  not  only  a  Bond  of

ground  makes  vs  earnest,  in  o'  desires,  and  we  hope  it  will  make  yo"  as

There  hath  beene  of  late  diu"  Propositions  of  great  and  beneficiall  workes 
for  the  Plantation  of  some  whereof  we  hope  ere  long  yo"  shall  see  the 
fruits,  and  hadd  ere  this  donn,  but  that  the  conceipt  of  much  miserie  in

yo"  that  iustice  and  favo"'  may  be  respectiuely  shewed:  and  that  of  those

Lawrance  May,  praying  yo"  that  o"'  promise  here  may  be  pformed  by 
delinking  him  there  so  much  Tobacco,  w"*"  he  hath  so  duly  earned,  and  in  a

Concerning  the  sending  home  of  the  Sassafras  as  last  yeare  in  the  Abigail, 
where  it  had  come  fraight  free,  it  would  haue  been  profitable,  so  now  on  the

little  grieved,  that  yo"  did  not  last  yeare  pforme  what  we  had  vnd'taken, 
being  as  we  conceaue  most  easie  to  haue  beene  donn,  but  we  pray  yo" 
that  amende  may  be  now  made  and  we  thinke  it  equitable  that  they  who 
last  yeare  should  haue  alon  pformed  it,  should  now  more  liberally  contribute 
vnto  it.

so  well  begunn,  may  be  constantly  psecuted  vntill  it  be  fully  effected,  and 
that  no  difficulties  whatsoever  cause  yo"  to  neglect  it.

A  Proclamation  against  stealing  of  beastC  &  Birds  of  Domcsticall  &  tame 
nature. 

By  the  Governo"'  and  Captaine  generall  of  Virginia. 

Forasmuch  as  the  healthful!  and  prosperous  estate  of  this  Colony,  depend? 
vpon  nothing  more,  then  the  plentifuU  encreasing  and  p!serving  of  all 
sort?  of  Beast?  and  bird?  of  domesticall  or  tame  nature,  whereof  there 
haue  of  late  beene  farr  greater  store  secretly  stolne  and  wasted  by  lewd 
and  ill  disposed  persons,  then  in  former  tunes;  to  the  great  losse  and  dis- 
couragement of  many  Planters,  and  to  the  no  smale  pliudice  of  the  Coleny 
it  self.  And  howsoeu9  heretofore  the  Stealing  of  some  of  these,  hath  not 
beene  prosecuted  as  ffelony  and  punished  w"'  death  as  according  to  the 
lawes  of  England  it  might  haue  beene,  vppon  w'"''  remissies  men  haue 
more  plsumed:  Yet  now  the  necessitie  of  the  time  requiring  o''  living 
nearer  together,  and  in  greater  bodies  (and  so  the  more  exposed  to  these 
mischeifs)  hath  moved  the  Governo"'  and  the  Counsell  of  State  to  order 
and  decree,  and  absolutely  resolue  in  these  cases  to  proceed  most  strictly 
and  exactly,  according  to  the  lawes  of  England,  aswell  against  all  con- 
cealo""'  and  accessaries,  as  agains'  the  principall?  thcmsclues.    And  to  the 


284  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPyhWY 

end  that  all  men  may  know  the  danger  of  the  law  in  these  cases  (though 
ignorance  of  the  Law  excuse  no  man)  they  haue  thought  fitt  to  publish  the 
same,  w'*"  is,  that  whosoevershall  steale  any  BeastC  or  Bird?  of  Domesticall 
or  tame  nature,  that  is  to  say,  Horses,  Mares,  ColtC,  Oxen,  Kine,  Calfes, 
Sheepe,  Lambs,  Goat?,  Kidd?,  Swine,  Pigg?,  Hens,  Geese,  DuckC,  Pea- 
cock?, Turkeys,  or  any  of  like  sorte  the  law  adiudgeth  it  ffelony  and 
punishable  w""  Death,  if  it  be  found  by  the  Jury  to  exeed  the  value  of 
twelue  pence:  otherwise  if  it  be  found  vnd"'  that  value,  the  parties  so  offend- 
ing are  to  be  corected  at  the  discretion  of  the  Magistrate  by  whipping,  or 
the  like  punishment.  And  though  in  England  the  valine  of  some  of  these 
tame  thing?  is  farr  lesse,  so  as  the  stealing  of  them  is  often  found  (in  favo' 
of  life)  but  petty  Laseny  and  so  toucheth  not  the  lines  of  the  offendo''':  yet 
here  they  are  of  farr  higher  rates,  by  reason  of  thcire  scarscitie,  and  there- 
fore wilbe  found  punishable  w"'  no  lesse  than  Death.  Given  at  James 
Cittie  the  21"'  day  of  September  1623.

of  the  povertie  of  that  Cropp)  and  that  this  yeare  the  publique  debt?  of 
the  Cuntrie  are  excedingly  increased,  w'^''  we  doubt  not  (these  being

4*''  of  this  pisent  Otober)  that  toward?  the  payment  of  the  said  publique 
debt?,  there  should  be  levied  (throughout  the  Colony)  10'  of  good  Mar-

you  colect  the  said  10'  of  good  marchauntable  Tobacco  (w*''in  ten  dayes 
at  the  furthest  after  sight  of  this  Warrant)  vppon  every  thousand  plant?,

iustly)  the  whole  penaltie  might  be  taken:  Yet  the  Governo''  and  Counsell

whome  I  send  vnto  you  to  make  gratefuU  acknowledgement  of  his  obligacon 
of  duty  &  service,  wherein  I  am  most  -v^dlling  to  become  his  surety,  nothing 
doubting  of  his  care  in  preserving  both  our  credits  with  you.  The  experi- 
ence I  have  had  of  him  for  full  fiue  yeares  together  during  the  tyme  of  his 
residence  here  in  the  College  &  the  contentment  he  hath  given  my  brother 
with  whome  he  hath  lived  since  for  this  twelue  moneth  &  vpwards  as  Tutor 
to  his  children,  make  me  thus  forward  to  vndertake  for  him.  It  may 
please  you  to  increase  our  ioinct  debt  vnto  you,  Ijy  secreting  vs  both  in 
this  buysines ;  for  that  it  may  be  vnkindly  taken  by  others  of  our  company 
from  vs  (or  at  the  lest  from  myself)  if  they  shall  vnderstand  that  I  haue 
moved  you  &  neglect  them;  whome  I  therfore  forbeare  as  yet  to  sollicite, 
because  I  hold  it  not  so  seasonable  to  appeare  further  in  this  sute  before 
the  place  shalbe  actually  voide,  which  I  thinke  wilbe  (if  the  party  alter 
not  in  his  resolucon)  eur  long.  Our  M''  is  now  abroade,  but  at  his  returne 
vnto  the  College  I  wiU  present  him  with  your  respectfuU  coiiiendacons. 
Contiuueing  mine  humble  &  hartiest  praiers  for  you,  I  recornend  the  best

ing or  concerning  the  aforesaid  plantation  or  any  business  whatsoever  pertaining  to 
the  same  plantation,  and  the  matter  in  the  same  plea  contained,  are  good  and  sufficient 
in  law  to  prevent  our  lord  the  King  himself  from  havmg  his  aforesaid  information  as 
to  these  liberties,  privileges,  and  franchises  against  themselves;  Which  plea,  and  the 
matter  in  the  same  contained,  the  same  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.]  are  prepared  to  verify, 
Wherefore  since  the  same  attorney  of  our  said  lord  the  King  for  our  same  lord  the 
Iving  does  not  answer  to  that  plea  nor  in  any  wise  deny  it  but  altogether  refuses  to 
admit  that  verification  thereof,  they  seek  judgment  in  this  cause,  and  that  they 
themselves,  the  same  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.]  be  dismissed,  etc.,  by  the  court  here,  i'-  ^T- 
as  to  these  liberties,  privileges,  and  franchises. 

And  because  the  court  of  our  lord  the  Iving  here  is  not  yet  advised  concerning  the 
rendering  of  his  judgment  of  and  upon  the  premises,  a  day  thereon  was  given  both 
to  the  aforesaid  Thomas  Coventrj^e,  attorney  general,  who  sues,  etc.,  and  to  the 
aforesaid  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.],  before  our  lord  the  Iving  to  the  fifteenth  day  from 
the  day  of  Easter,  wheresoever,  etc.,  for  hearing  his  judgment  thereon,  etc.,  on  which 
fifteenth  day  of  Easter  there  came  before  our  lord  the  King  at  Westminster  both  the 
aforesaid  Thomas  Coventrye,  who  sues,  etc.,  and  the  aforcsaitl  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.], 
by  their  attorney  aforesaid. 

And  because  the  court  of  our  lord  the  Iving  here  is  not  yet  advised  of  his  judgment 
to  be  returned  of  and  upon  the  premises  a  day  was  given  thereon  both  to  the  afore- 
said Thomas  Coventrye,  who  sues,  etc.,  and  to  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  fl'arrer  [et  al.], 
before  our  lord  the  Iving  on  the  morrow  of  Holy  Trinity,  wheresoever,  etc.,  for  hear- 
ing his  judgment  thereon,  etc.,  at  which  morrow  of  Holy  Trinity  there  came  before 
our  lord  the  King  at  Westminster  both  the  aforesaid  Thomas  Coventrye,  who  sues, 
etc.,  and  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.],  by  their  attorney  aforesaid. 

And  the  same  attorney  of  our  said  lord  the  King  for  our  same  lord  the  King  seeks 
judgment,  and  that  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  ffarrer  [et  al.]  be  convicted,  etc.,  of  the 
premises  by  the  court  here. 

Upon  there  having  been  seen  and  understood  by  the  court  of  our  said  lord  the  King 
here,  both  the  matter  in  the  information  aforesaid  exhibited  by  the  aforesaid  Thomas 
Coventr\'e  here  in  court  for  our  lord  the  Iving  himself  and  the  aforesaid  jilea  of  the 
aforesaid  Nicholas  fl'arrer  [et  al.],  above  pleaded  by  themselves  to  the  information 
aforesaid,  and  all  and  singular  the  premises,  and  mature  deliberation  thereon  formerly 
held,  because  it  seems  to  the  court  of  our  lord  the  Iving  here  that  the  plea  aforesaitl 
of  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  fl'tirrer  [et  al.],  pleaded  above  in  the  form  aforesaid  as  to 
having,  using,  enjoying,  or  claiming  the  liberties,  privileges,  and  franchises  aforesaid 
specified  above  m  the  information  aforesaid  and  claimed  and  vindicated  above  by 
their  plea  aforesaid  by  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  fl'arrer  [et  al.]  is  not  sufficient  in  law  to 
preclude  our  same  lord  the  Iving  from  his  aforesaid  information  for  the  usm-pation  of 
the  liberties,  privileges,  and  franchises  aforesaid,  specified  in  the  information  afore- 
said, over  our  said  lord  the  Iving,  it  is  considered  that  the  aforesaid  Nicholas  ffarrer

must  break  out  into  mischief.  And  verily  an  enimie,  were  better  then 
such  a  suretie:  But  I  wUl  never  interpret  an  hastie  woord  to  his  woorst. 
There  shall  no  man  sustain  losse  by  me,  nor  trowble  by  suit:  Of  this  be 
assured:  Neither  will  I  use  credit  longer,  then  of  necessitie. 

And  now  to  my  busines.  The  22'-  w"*"  y"  have  received  from  the  Pordages, 
is  to  be  thus  disposed  of:  Fortie  shillings  to  yo''  self,  for  the  half  moneth 
over:  §&§  the  20'  to  yo"'  mother,  w"'  an  addition  of  lO'-  more  from  M' 
Kay:  who  (I  speak  it  to  yo'  self  only,)  hath  had  my  money  in  his  hands 
a  good  whUe,  &  som  of  it  (viz  51')  these  4  moneths:  a  parcell  not  yet 
by  him  acknowledged:  But  so  much  I  perceive,  both  by  my  Receivo' 
M'  Hardwick,  &  my  Bailie  Richard  Waind,  in  their  severall  letters.  The 
provision  w'^''  I  made  was  timelie  enough:  I  needed  not  have  trowbled 
anie  man,  had  I  been  delt  w"*  as  was  fit.  The  next  payment  is  of  my 
Bond  to  S'  Nicolas  Tufton,  for  207'.-  10^-  on  the  24^''  of  this  moueth: 
w'^''  must  needs  be  discharged:  for  so  I  promised.  But  his  use  of  the 
monie  is  not  till  the  last  of  the  Term.  Toward  this,  after  the  10'-  paid 
to  yo'  mother,  there  wilbe  in  M'  Kays  hands  of  the  250'.-  paid  to  him

Term,  he  wilbe  there  himself  w*''  the  Rest  of  my  monie  due  from  his 
charge:  w'^''  I  count  cannot  come  to  so  little  as  30'.  more:  There  is  also 
now  with  me  one  M'  W.  Kay  my  Tenant,  who  is  indebted  to  me  very 
neer  100'-:  toward  w''^  he  hath  brought  up  about  80.  firkins  of  Butter:

or  very  neer  all  come  in;)  would  beside  that  Bond,  discharge  also  my 
other  bond  of  103';  12^.  to  S^  Nicolas  Tufton,  due  on  the  26'^  of  this 
moneth:  &  also  my  interest  of  27'.'  to  M^  Abdie  &  M^  Godscall:  w^''  is 
all  that  this  Term  I  desire  to  pay:  My  Baylies  also  advertize  me,  that 
there  wilbe  paid  in  at  York,  in  the  end  of  this  moneth  to  be  returned 
to  M^  Ro  Ray  160'.  more  or  thereabout.  So  that  had  I  but  a  frend

hould  the  worke  to

then  the  end  bee  it  that

wilbe  quickhe  descyded 
whether  it  bee  not

to  the  attaineing  of  the 
politick  End  must  be 
preferred,  this  question 
is  by  it  descyded  see  the 
word  polycy. 

And  whereas  wee  have  since  contrarie  to  our 
first  proceedeinges  beene  induced  by  severall 
Letters  Patentcs  dated  ...  to  ordayne  and 
institute  severall  orders  of  governementes,  in 
our  southerne  and  northerne  plantacions  now 
tcarmed  Virginea  and  New  England,  therein 
applieing  our  selves  to  the  desires  (and  as  wee 
feare  the  private  endes)  of  the  adventurers 
heare,  which  layeing  the  groundes  of  their 
governement  accordeing  to  their  private  interest 
and  severall  joyntestockes,  have  governed  our 
free  subjedes  in  Virginica  as  if  they  were  (heir 
servauntes,  Wee  knoweing  thearefore,  that  thcase 
severall  formes  of  governementes  doe  breede 
distractions,  as  well  amongst  the  adventurers 
heare,  as  our  loveing  subjectes  the  personal] 
planters,  and  understandeing  that  the  joynte- 
stockes of  the  Southerne  Plantacion  (whereon 
their  governement  heare  by  voices  was  founded) 
is  now  spent  and  gone,  and  the  plantacion  dothe 
subsist  onely  of  the  ould  planters  now  made 
free  of  severall  private  coUonies,  planted  by 
Patentees,  and  of  diverse  pubhque  servauntes, 
planted  by  the  Collections  and  Lotteries,

The  reasons  why  this  it  is  able  to  defend  it  selfe  and  fitt  to  put  one

nesse  of  a  commonwealth,  lyeth  not  soe  much 
in  the  spaciousnesse  of  it,  but  first  and  principally 
in  the  governement,  consisteing  in  the  mutuall 
duties  of  commandeing  and  obeyeing,  next  in 
possessing  thinges  plentifully,  necessarie  for  the 
life  of  man,  doe  professe  that  next  and  im-

God  in  converteing  of  the  infidells  to  the  knowl- 
edge and  worshippe  of  Him,  we  intend  wholely 
the  good  of  our  subjects:  first  to  the  planters 
and  adventurers,  then  to  the  planted,  which 
wee  would  have  soe  cherished  that  they  may 
prove  planters  themselves,  and  to  that  end 
endeavoureing  to  cause  both  England  and 
Virginea,  to  endowe  each  other  with  their 
benefittes  and  profittes  that  theareby  layeing 
aside  force  and  our  coactive  power,  wee  may  by 
our  justice  and  bountie  marrye  and  combinde 
those  our  provinces  to  us  and  our  soveraignetye

this  marriage  our  politicke  and  last  end,  to 
teach  us  what  are  the  meanes  that  conduce  to 
it,  and  to  give  Ijoth  measure  order  and  end  to 
them.  To  which  purpose  not  suffering  any  one 
to  growe  to  greate,  for  feare  of  shaddoweing  and 
hindering  the  rayes  of  our  Majestie  to  shine 
over  all.  Wee  will  give  to  each  planter  advaunce-

give  farthorance  thereto.  In  regard  thearefore 
this  our  soveraigne  and  uniteing  power  (and

ter,  see  the  treatice  on    as  severed  in  distance  and  place,  Wee  (findeing 
the  word  forme.  that  nothing  canne  reduce  this  many  into  one 

againe  but  forme)  doe  ordayne  one  setled  and 
iinoveable  forme,  to  governe  all  the  plantacions 
within  the  degrees  aforesayde,  which  forme 
being  maturely  deliberated,  ever  one  and  the  same, 
soe  as  wholely  intendeing  the  end,  it  shall  worke 
noething  but  good  theareto,  wheareby  yt  shall  not 
onely  serve  as  a  medicine  to  cure  all  the  malig- 
nities that  the  plantacion  doth  naturally  bring 
with  it,  by  reason  of  the  distance  of  the  place, 
but  it  shall  alsoe  by  waye  of  right  and  interest 
procure  us  apt  instrumentes  for  the  form  to 
worke  by,  and  prepare  matter  of  apt  condition 
for  it  to  worke  one  [on],  soe  farr  forth,  as  if  wee 
laye  the  forme  aright,  to  matter  soe  capeable 
of  it,  wee  may  conclude  that  the  properties  of 
the  forme  must  of  necessitie  foUowe.  The 
matter  thearefore  whereone  our  forme  must 
worke  being  the  people  and  the  place,  which  are 
to  bee  distinguished  and  divided,  and  our 
soveraigne  faculties  limited  to  tliem  by  funda- 
mentall  lawes  and  order.  Wee  will  first  give 
lawes  and  order  to  the  people  and  then  we  will 
appoynte  them  their  places,  fortifiecations,  and 
manner  of  spreadeing. 

First  thearefore  that  God  maie  the  better  give 
a  blesseing  to  our  endeavours,  wee  doe  strictely 
charge  and  commaund  all  our  presidentes, 
councelles,  magistrates,  patriotes,  governors, 
and  ministers  within  our  sayde  severall  coUonies, 
respectively  within  their  severall  limittes  and  pre- 
cinctes,  that  they  with  all  diligent  care  and 
respect,  doe  provide  that  the  true  word  and  serv- 
ice of  God  and  Christian  faith  bee  preached 
planted  and  used,  not  onely  within  everie  the 


BEFORE  DECEMBER  7,1623  413 

sayde  severall  collonies,  but  alsoe  as  much  as 
they  may  amongst  the  savage  people,  which 
doe  or  shall  adjoyne  unto  them,  and  border 
uppon  them,  accordeing  to  the  doctrine,  rightes, 
rehgion,  and  eclesiasticall  forme  of  governcment 
now  professed  and  established  in  England. 

And  because  wee  knowe  that  where  Moses  and 
Aaron  agree  not  there  religion  will  not  onely  bee 
scandalled  but  the  soveraignetye  must  needes 
goe  to  wracke,  therefore  wee  doe  ordayne  that 
whoesoever  hee  shall  bee  that  shall  refuse  to  bee 
governed  by  our  eclesiasticall  government  estab- 
Ushed,  he  shall  bee  heald  and  esteemed  as  a 
resister  of  our  soveraigne  power,  commaundeing 
all  our  administers  of  justice,  whome  it  shall 
concerne,  not  to  suffer  any  person  or  persons  to 
remaine  or  abide  within  our  sayde  plantacions, 
whoe  shall  professe  any  doctrine  contrarie  to 
oures,  or  shall  attempt  to  withdrawe  any  of  our 
people  inhabiteing  or  which  shall  inhabite  within 
any  of  the  sayde  colonies  and  plantacions  (or 
any  of  the  naturalls  bordering  one  them)  from 
the  same  governement  or  from  their  due  alle- 
geance  to  us  our  heires  and  successours,  which 
persons  soe  often  offendeing  shall  bee  aprehended 
and  imprisoned,  untill  hee  shall  throughly  re- 
forme  himselfe  or  otherwise  where  the  cause  shall 
require  it  be  banished  Virginea  and  sent  to 
England  heare  to  receave  condigne  punishment, 
for  his  or  their  offence  or  offences. 

And  because  wee  are  informed  that  some  of  the 
former  governores  both  heare  and  in  Virginea 
have  contrarie  to  their  patent,  and  our  Royall 
instructions  which  tyed  them  to  make  their

whereas  this  giveing  Ufe  to  lawes  is  one  of  the 
highest  poyntes  of  our  soveraignetye  given  us 
from  God  to  benifitte  not  to  destroye  our  sub- 
jectes, wee  shall  hould  our  selfe  guiltie  of  the 
injurie  done  if  wee  should  not  see  it  extreemely 
punished.  And  this  being  done  in  the  face  of 
our  majestie  what  may  wee  hope  for  soe  farr  of

therfore  most  jealous  of  our  honour  in  that  kinde, 
wee  doe  straightely  chardge  and  commaund 
that  noe  instrument  of  our  soveraigne  power 
shall  dare  to  encroach  uppon  any  parte  of  our 
soveraignety,  further  then  they  shall  bee  war- 
ranted by  the  councell  of  state,  or  by  thease 
our  orders  and  lawes  now  sett  downe,  uppon 
payne  of  hightreason.  And  to  the  end  this  lawe 
shall  bee  the  more  strictely  kept  wee  will  give 
the  goodes  of  such  offendoers  to  the  publique 
treasurie  makeing  the  publicke  both  judge  and

Wee  therefore  doe  especially  chargde,  commaund

This  severing  our  de- 
grees accordinge  as 
every  one  appropriates 
his  freedome  to  hini- 
selfe  fundamentally  by 
purchase  must  naturally 
take  awaye  all  conten- 
tion aswell  for  equall 
liberty  as  for  riches  and 
consequently  lottes 
founded  on  a  rethmeti- 
call  equallytie,  for  every 
one  will  labour  to  main- 
taine  the  propriety  of 
his  freedome  in  his  de- 
gree   according    to    his 


accordeing  to  the  rules  and  orders  by  us  now 
sett  downe  uppon  payne  of  being  taken  for 
rebbels  and  outlawes. 

And  wee  doe  further  charge  and  commaund 
all  our  presidentes,  councelles  and  magistrates, 
within  their  jurisdictions,  that  onely  the  offences 
of  tumultes,  rebellions,  conspiracies,  mutinies 
and  seditions,  such  as  shall  come  to  that  hight, 
that  they  shall  prove  dangerous  to  the  state 
theare,  togeather  with  murders,  manslaughters, 
incest,  rapes,  and  adulteries,  togeather  with 
such  offences  as  wee  by  thease  our  lawes  and 
orders,  shall  make  fellonie  or  treason,  to  bee 
committed  in  those  partes  within  the  precinct 
of  the  degrees  before  mentioned,  and  noe  other 
offences,  shall  bee  punished  by  death  without 
the  benifitte  of  clergie,  except  in  the  cause  of 
manslaughter  in  which  clergie  is  to  be  allowed. 

It  foUoweth  now  that  we  sett  downe  thease  our 
orders,  degrees  of  councehcrs,  magistrates,  gov- 
ernors, and  all  under  officers  belongeing  to  this 
our  forme,  which  falls  out,  first  to  devide  all 
our  adventureours  into  two  orders,  severing  such 
as  are  free  of  our  soyle  and  trade  onely,  from 
them  that  are  citizens  and  free  of  our  governe- 
ment. 

Of  the  first  order  there  are  likewise  2  sortes, 
servauntes  that  haveing  served  out  their  time, 
and  tenauntes  that  have  estates  in  dependensie 
of  their  masters  and  laudlordes,  togeather  with 
freedome  of  trade,  but  have  noe  shares. 

The  second  sorte  are  such,  whoe  goeing  one  [on] 
their  owne  charges  they  gayne  a  share,  and  like-

right  as  well  as  his 
goodes  and  landes.  And 
Cicero  in  his  Offices 
saith  that  thoughe  by 
the  instinct  of  nature, 
men  were  drawne  into 
sotiable  assemblies,  3'et 
the  better  to  save  the 
propriety  of  tlieir 
goodes  was  the  funda- 
mentall  end  that  made 
them  fynde  out  heades, 
governours,  and  presi- 
dentes  of  citties,  the 
mouthe  of  equall  lib- 
ertye  therefore  must 
needes  bee  stopped,  and 
this  maintenance  of 
theire  degrees  \\\\\  im- 
moveably  fixe  the  forme 
of  the  coUonie,  and  it 
will  bee  a  greater  greife 
for  anie  cittizen  to  have 
a  note  of  ignomynrie 
layed  uppon  hun  to  bee 
suspended  from  his  de- 
gree, or  suncke  a  degree 
lower  than  it  was  by  the 
lawes  in  printe  to  bee 
burnte  throughc  the 
tongue,  whipt  or  n)ade 
gallislaves,  by  this 
meanes  we  male 
avoyde  all  corporall 
punishement    for    free- 


wise  freedome  of  trade  but  are  not  citiezens  till 
they  have  not  [?]  carryed  over  2  men. 

The  second  order  of  adventurers  are  such  whoe 
appropriateing  unto  themselves  their  freedome, 
their  landes  and  their  degrees  by  purchase,  they 
communicate  either  in  the  choice  or  participa- 
tion of  councells  and  magistracies  and  them  wee 
call  our  citiezens  devideing  them  into  5  degrees. 

The  first  degree  is  the  patriot  or  patrition,  they 
are  such  as  are  first  named  patentees  in  the 
particular  plantacions  of  colonies,  cities,  and 
corporations,  thease  sliall  bee  such  as  haveing 
good  estates  in  England  they  shall  carrie  or 
drawe  over  with  them  to  the  number  of  300  men 
as  their  parteners  and  adherences  of  whome  they 
must  bee  protectors  and  for  whose  good  abeare- 
ing  they  must  bee  pledges. 

The  second  degree  are  such  as  are  admitted  to 
bee  of  the  order  of  governors  by  tlie  patriot, 
whose  name  being  joyned  in  the  patent,  the 
power  of  cheife  governeing  those  colonies,  if  they 
bee  thereunto  elected  shall  be  graunted  unto 
them.  Thease  must  likewise  have  estates  in 
England  either  in  land,  or  money  in  banke,  and 
they  must  carrie  over,  or  send,  as  many  men,  as 
the  patrition  of  the  colonie  and  they  canne  agree 
to  have  their  names  soe  put  in.  The  patrition 
may  alsoe  at  any  time  after  admitte  as  many 
into  the  colonie  as  hee  please,  they  bringeing 
men  to  him  to  encrease  his  colonie. 

The  S"*.  degree  are  such  as  shall  bee  maiores  and 
aldermen  in  the  foresayde  citties  and  corpora- 
cions,  and  they  shall  carrie  over  sixe  men.

men  except  it  bee  where 
the  case  deserves  death, 
and  this  will  breede  in 
the  planters  the  more 
noble  spirittes. 


This  riseinge  order, 
the  lowermost  orders 
chooseing  their  govern- 
ours  out  of  the  upper- 
moste,  will  necessarilie 
suppresse  popular  lib- 
ertie  and  keepe  the 
soveraigne  faculties  and 
the  commaund   of   the 


The  4"'.  degree  shall  bee  common  councellors, 
and  they  shall  carrie  over  foure  men. 

The  5"'.  degree  are  commoners,  and  they  sliall 
carrie  over  two  men. 

And  if  any  one  shall  committe  any  act  wheareby 
his  life  and  goodes  shall  bee  forfeited  to  us, 
though  his  life  bee  pardoned  hee  shall  bee 
suspended  from  his  degree  till  hee  hath  brought 
over  a  certayne  number  of  men,  accordeing  to 
the  quallitie  of  his  first  degree,  to  restore  him 
to  his  sayde  degree  agayne. 

Moreover  wee  ordayne  that  of  all  thease  5 
degrees,  the  eldest  sonne  onely  shall  bee  of  his 
fathers  degree  and  the  younger  shall  bee  of  the 
degree  belowe  it  except  they  canne  rayse  them- 
selves by  carrieing  of  of  men. 

And  further  wee  ordayne  that  the  meanest 
servaunt  that  goeth  (God  soe  blesseing  him  and 
his  endeavours,  that  hee  canne  purchase  and 
[an]  estate  in  England  or  compasse  to  carrie  over 
or  drawe  over  with  him  of  his  friendes  and 
adherences  the  number  of  300  men)  he  may 
become  a  lord  patriot  which  is  the  greatest  place 
the  commonwealth  canne  beare. 

Now  for  the  choice  and  election  of  our  officers, 
magistrates  and  governours,  wee  must  beginne 
at  the  lowermost  degree,  sc:  the  commoners  that 
carrie  over  2  men  they  shaU  choose  out  of  them- 
selves the  burrowehoulders,  surveyours  of  the 
high  wayes,  and  such  hke  officers.  And  out  of 
them  that  carrie  foure  men  they  shall  like- 
wise choose  their  common  councellers,  church- 
wardens and  such  like  officers.     The  common

the  affections  of  theis  in- 
strumentes  by  theire 
private  intresses  and  es- 
tates in  England,  give- 
ing  them  such  sufficient 
power  as  shall  make  it  a 
commonwealth  able  to 
maintaine  it  sclfe  by 
itseKe  soe   farre  forthe 


councellers  shall  choose  their  aldermen  cind 
shreiffe  out  of  them  that  carrie  6  men.  The 
aldermen  shall  have  a  maior  by  turnes  except 
some  greate  disabillitie  happeneth  and  then  the 
next  in  turne  shall  be  maior.  The  Maior  and 
aldermen  shall  choose  their  governour  either 
out  of  them  that  bee  admitted  to  bee  of  the 
order  of  governours  by  the  patrition,  or  the 
patrition  hiraselfe.  The  maior  and  aldermen 
alsoe  of  [each]  severall  corporation  shall  have 
power  to  choose  out  of  their  corporation  one  of 
the  order  of  governours  or  the  patrition  himselfe 
to  bee  of  the  provinciall  councell,  which  councell 
being  all  chosen  out  of  the  patritions  and  the 
order  of  governoures  in  everie  province,  and 
consisteing  of  5,  7,  9, 11,  13,  or  15,  they  shall  have 
a  monethly  president  by  turnes,  whoe  haveing  2 
voices,  hee  shall  for  his  moneth  call  and  breake  of 
[off]  all  assemblies,  and  untill  the  councell  of 
union  bee  compleate,  wee  give  them  the  same 
power,  which  wee  doe  give  to  our  sayde  councell 
of  union,  makeing  all  theire  decrees  to  stand  as 
lawe,  till  they  are  disauulled  by  us,  by  the  gen- 
erall  parliament  in  Virginea  or  by  the  sayd 
councell  of  union,  when  it  shall  bee  compleate 
and  in  force,  accordeing  to  our  order  now  sett 
downe. 

This  councell  of  union  being  the  most  soveraigne 
councell  wee  will  tearme  a  Syncretisme  or 
councell  of  union  with  the  councell  of  England 
and  this  councell  shall  bee  chosen  onely  out  of 
the  patriotes  of  everie  province,  by  a  component 
number  of  electours  chosen  out  of  the  order  of 
governoures  which  are  not  patritions,  one  out 
of  everie  particular  corporation,  which  electors 
shall  bee  chosen  by  the  maior  and  aldermen  the

Cicero  to  be  the  Ijcst

The  presidentes  being  thus  ordered  their  3  voices 
or  two  of  them  shall  conclude  all  causes  that  shall 
bee  controverted  by  ecjuall  voices  and  not  con- 
cluded in  the  bodie  of  the  councell,  the  eldest

without  any  presidentes,  the  elder  counceller  of 
the  3  to  summon  and  breake  of  [off]  the

And  our  will  and  pleasure  is  that  (besides  the 
oath  of  our  supremacie  which  all  our  subjectes

Virginea  to  the  crowne  of  England  as  for  the

our  commissions  and  writtes  of  justice  may

then  shall  they  bee  tearmed  knightes  patriotes 
with  the  title  of  Sir.  When  they  have  attayned 
to  bee  600  strong,  at  which  number  wee  (in- 
tendeing  everie  planter  and  servaunt  to  bee  the 
father  of  a  familie)  doe  stente  the  colonies  that 
they  shall  not  exceede  above  soe  many  families 
(or  that  anoether  colonie  hath  issued  out  of 
them)  our  will  and  pleasure  is  that  their  sonnes 
and  heires  shall  bee  then  knightes  patriotes  and 
they  themselves  shall  bee  Barrons  and  tearmed 
lord  patriotes,  their  wifes  and  other  children 
takeing  their  honoures  and  places  accordeingly. 
In  time  of  peace  they  shall  bee  and  have  the 
authoritie  of  our  leiuetenauntes  of  sheires  in 
England,  to  appoynte  the  commaunders  of  our 
men  at  amies,  see  them  trayned,  to  looke  to 
their  amies  and  watches.  In  time  of  warre  they 
shall  bee  charged  with  what  number  of  men  the 
councell  of  state  shall  thinke  fitt.

nor   cann   the  councell     The  patriot  must  bee  allowed  his  leiiietenaunt 
execute   ought   but   by    aswell  in  cases  of  disabillitie,  by  nonage  or  ini- 
such  an  instrument  no    potencie,  or  in  their  abscence  either  about  the 
more  then  the  head  can     busienes   of   the  state   theare,  or  about   their 
worke  withoute  handcs,     private  busienes  in  England,  but  these  leiueten- 
but  this  wee  must  bee    auntes  shall  bee  chosen  by  the  order  of  aldermen 
sure  of,  that  he  that  is    out  of  the  order  of  governoures  the  better  to 
soe    chosen    must    bee    give  the  sayde  order  of  aldermen  content, 
well    affected    to    the 
state    heare,    he    must 
bee  an  austeare  gover- 
nour,  whome  the  people 
are  afraide  of,  his  time 
lymitted  must  not  bee 
too  longe. 

And  whereas  the  patriotes  are  the  principalest  ringleaders  and  greatest 
adventurers,  which  carrie  and  drawe  with  them  their  freindes,  kindred, 
followers  and  adherence  out  of  their  naturall  countrie  to  a  place  soe  farr 
remoate,  to  be  protected  governed  and  cherished  by  them,  Wee  doe  there- 
fore will  and  commaund  all  our  sayde  patriotes,  loveingly  carefully  and 
cheerefuUy  to  performe  this  their  trust.  And  wee  doe  ordayne  that  after 
admonition  for  being  churlelish  and  negligent  in  that  kinde,  they  shall 
bee  noted  with  a  note  of  ignominie,  if  they  shall  not  endeavour  the  helpeing 
and  protecteing  any  of  their  foresayde  adherence,  by  all  lawfuU  meanes 
they  may,  and  this  wee  charge  as  well  all  our  presidentes  councells  and 
marshalls  to  looke  carefully  unto,  the  rather  to  drawe  the  Indyans  to  the 
like  dependencye. 

And  wee  doe  further  ordayne  that  from  the  time  that  the  patriot  shall  bee 
planted  abroade,  his  estate  of  inheritance  in  England,  togeather  with  his 
honoures  titles  and  inheritance  in  Virginea,  shall  bee  soe  united  and  made 
one  to  him  and  his  heires  that  he  shall  not  sell  the  one  without  the  other, 
and  that  sale  to  bee  made  by  the  consent  of  our  councell  of  union  in  ^'ir- 
gmea  and  our  Virginea  councell  in  England,  or  the  most  parte  of  them 
meeteing  at  their  generall  courtes  and  not  otherwise.  And  if  it  happen 
that  the  patriot  doe  dye  leaveing  noe  heire  male  of  his  name  then  shall 
it  goe  to  the  female  and  their  heires.     And  the  eldest  daughter  of  the 


424  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

patrition,  and  the  heires  that  shall  challenge  by  the  female  side  and  their 
children  shall  beare  the  patriotes  sirname,  if  they  will  inherite  the  sayde 
honoures  and  landes,  which  if  they  shall  refuze  that  then  the  nexte  of  the 
kinde  either  by  the  father  and  then  of  the  mothers  side,  takeing  the 
patriotes  adopted  sirname  shall  enjoye  the  sayde  inheritance. 

And  because  wee  knowe  howe  dangerous  it  will  bee  to  the  state  to  suffer 
thease  greate  honoures  and  inheritances,  to  bee  conjoyned  either  by  com- 
binations, leagues,  and  marriages,  wheareby  some  one  familie  may  growe 
monsterous  hi  the  state,  thearefore  wee  doe  establish  and  ordayne  that  noe 
person  planteing  or  inhabiteing  within  any  of  our  provinces  within  the 
degrees  aforesayde  shall  make  any  leagues,  combynacions  or  contractes 
either  by  worde  or  writeing,  or  confirmeing  them  by  oaths,  offensive  or 
defensive,  to  the  mainetenaunce  of  any  faction  whatsoever,  uppon  payne  of 
forfeiteing  their  goodes  and  lives  as  fellons,  and  to  prevente  the  combindeing 
and  conjoyneing  of  thease  honoures  in  one  house  by  marriage  wee  doe 
further  ordayne  that  such  eldest  daughter  or  heire  female  as  shall  marrie 
with  any  patriott,  or  the  heire  of  a  patriott,  shall  disinable  herselfe  from 
inherriteing  her  fathers  or  predecessours  patriotshippe  thereby,  except  shee 
marryeing  of  a  husband  soe  inamored  with  her  that  he  shall  sell  or  give 
away  his  owne  partiotshippe  and  soe  shall  take  the  sirname  of  his  wifes 
auncester,  he  may  by  that  meanes  inable  hhnselfe  to  inherite  her  honoures 
and  estate  and  soe  by  marryeing  the  inheritrix  of  the  patriot,  hee  will  bee 
accoinpted  a  kinde  husband,  and  that  will  be  his  portion.  The  principall 
intent  of  frameing  this  lawe  being  that  noe  one  subject  shall  either  by 
purchase  or  any  other  meanes  unite  the  forces,  theareby  to  inable  himselfe 
to  bee  stronger  then  any  of  his  order. 

But  to  the  end  that  love  may  bee  mayntayned,  and  that  theise  degrees 
may  not  estrange  the  upper  orders  from  the  lower,  wee  wish  that  the  heires 
and  eldest  sonnes  of  the  upper  orders  may  marrie  with  the  daughters  of  the 
lower  orders,  soe  to  rayse  their  wives  fortunes.  And  that  the  daughteres  of 
of  the  upper  orders  being  heires  may  marrye  with  the  sonnes  of  the  lower 
orders,  makeing  choice  of  the  most  vertuous,  soe  as  vertue  may  advance 
both  men  and  woemen  to  marriages,  and  that  all  degrees  may  bee  thereby 
bound  togeather  in  the  bonde  of  love  that  none  may  be  scorned  but  the 
scorner.

To  this  end  alsoe,  although  wee  would  not  have  you  imitate  the  Irish  in 
their  wilde  and  barbarous  maners,  yet  wee  will  commend  one  custome 
of  theires  unto  you,  which  is  that  the  poorer  sorte  sueing  to  gett  the  nurse- 
ing  of  the  children  of  the  lordes  and  gentrie,  and  breedeing  upp  in  their 
minoritie  as  their  owne,  this  breedeing,  together  with  their  custome,  doth 
begett  anoether  natiu'e  in  them  to  love  their  foster  children  and  brethren,  as 
if  they  were  naturally  bread  of  the  same  parentes,  and  they  are  accompted 
most  vile  and  base  that  shall  neglect  any  good  oportunitie  to  shew  their 
thankefulnesse  and  love  thus  begotten  and  bread  betweene  the  riche  and 
poore. 

And  because  wee  will  give  all  furtherance  of  the  spreadeing  of  thease  newe 
collonies  wee  doe  thearefore  ordayne  and  appoynte  that  all  such  ser- 
vauntes  that  shall  be  carried  at  the  carge  [charge]  of  any  adventurer  or 
planter,  both  those  servauntes  that  are  soe  carryed  over  and  their  ser- 
vauntes,  with  their  servauntes  servauntes,  shall  bee  tyed  to  plante  in 
consorteshippe  with  their  first  masters,  and  shall  rise  and  remove  with 
them  to  plant  a  newe  eolonie  when  their  foresayde  masters  shall  bee 
enabled  by  our  forme  thereunto,  which  shall  bee  after  hee  hath  gayned 
and  [an]  estate  in  England  and  is  able  to  drawe  over  or  carrie  with  him 
300  men,  leaveing  the  collonie  hee  was  first  planted  in  300  strong  or  up- 
war  des. 

The  next  magistracic  is  the  governour,  him  wee  ordayne  after  the  death  of 
the  first  patriott  to  bee  aunuall  by  election,  but  dureing  the  life  of  the  first 
patriott  hee  shall  bee  governour  and  af terwardes  his  heires  shall  bee  honoured 
as  head  of  that  order  but  shall  not  governe  unlesse  hee  bee  theareunto 
chosen.  The  governours  charge  shall  bee  to  see  the  lawes,  decrees  and 
orders  aswell  in  the  publique  governement  of  the  eolonie  as  in  the  private 
families  observed,  hee  shall  controlle  all  men  for  breach  of  manners  and 
discipline,  first  giveing  them  private  admonition  and  afterwardcs  pubhque 
if  they  perscever  in  their  misdemeanour.  Hee  togeather  [ivith]  the  maior, 
the  shreife,  the  churchwarden,  and  one  commoner  chosen  by  the  rest  of 
the  commoners,  the  governour  haveing  the  casteing  voice,  they  shall  have 
power  to  indite  for  breach  of  lawes,  and  to  suspend  from  degrees  for  breach 
[of]  manners  accordeing  as  in  their  discretion  shall  be  thought  meete. 


426  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

The  next  order  that  wee  ordajnie  is  the  maior  and  aldermen,  togeather 
with  the  shreife,  all  which  3  orders  in  matters  of  triall  of  life  and  death, 
wee  ordayne  that  they  shall  bee  tryed  either  by  the  councell  of  state  or 
the  provinciall  councell,  the  jurie  that  tryeth  them  being  to  bee  of  their 
owne  ranke  and  order,  and  in  case  where  there  are  not  soe  many  to  bee 
founde,  they  shall  bee  supplied  out  of  the  order  and  ranke  next  beneath 
them. 

And  wee  doe  give  as  well  to  our  provinciall  councell  as  to  this  degree  and 
order  the  jurisdiction  over  all  persons  and  degrees  under  their  order,  they 
haveing  some  one  learned  in  the  law  to  direct  them.  And  wee  doe  ordajTie 
that  both  our  sayde  severall  councells  and  the  sayde  maiour  and  aldermen, 
shall  have  full  power  and  authoritie  in  theire  jurisdictions  to  heare  and 
determine  as  well  all  capitoU  as  criminall  causes,  which  in  the  precinctes  of 
their  severall  colonies  or  corporacions  in  manner  and  forme  followeing 
(that  is  to  saye)  by  twelve  honest  and  indifferent  persons,  as  neere  as 
canne  bee  of  the  plaintifes  and  defendantes  rankes  and  orders,  then  the 
sayde  juries  to  bee  chosen  indifferently  out  of  both  their  orders,  which 
juries  are  to  be  returned  by  the  marshalls,  for  the  provinciall  councell,  and 
by  the  shreifes  for  trialls  in  corporations,  thease  jurours  being  sworne 
uppon  the  evangelist  shall  accordeing  to  their  evidence  to  bee  given  unto 
them  uppon  oath,  and  accordeing  to  the  trueth  in  their  consciences  either 
convicte  or  acquitte  the  persons  accused  and  tryed  by  them,  or  shall  trie 
causes  for  matter  of  right,  betwene  the  plaintife  and  defendaunt,  guided 
by  their  consciences  and  by  evidence  one  oath  delivered  to  them,  wee 
giveing  authoritie  to  the  provinciall  councell  and  to  the  maiour  and  alder- 
men, in  either  of  their  jurisdictions  respectively  to  repreeve  and  put  of  [off] 
execution  of  any  one  adjudged  to  dye,  but  wee  will  graunte  noe  power  to 
pardon  death,  to  any  but  to  our  greate  Councell  of  State. 

Furthermore  for  the  ordering  of  our  under  orders  in  thease  our  corporations 
wee  doe  ordayne  that  everie  alderman  shall  have  his  severall  warde  devided 
to  them  accordeing  as  their  number  of  citiezens  encrease,  and  everie  one 
must  have  a  common  counceller  under  him  as  a  deputie  whoe  must  ap- 
poynte  under  them  everie  tenne  men  a  taskemaster  chosen  out  of  the 
commoners,  or  of  the  best  laboureers,  thease  must  worke  in  the  head  of 
their  file,  and  giveing  them  good  example  must  direct  and  over  see  them. 


BEFORE  DECEMBER  7,  1623  427 

And  the  taskemasters  and  common  councellers  must  weekely  relate  to  the 
governoures,  whoe  loytereth  and  whoe  taketh  paynes,  and  they  must 
be  rewarded  or  punished  accordeingly.  Thease  taskemasters  and  common 
councellers  in  their  wardes,  must  alsoe  take  care  of  all  sicke  persons,  and 
they  must  complaine  of  masters  that  abuse  their  servauntes,  in  suffering 
them  to  want  either  foode  or  apparrell.  All  thease  thinges  must  bee  cer- 
tiefied  to  the  governour  and  hee  must  see  it  amended,  for  they  and  the 
whole  colonie  as  a  bodie  politicke,  must  make  good  to  the  state  there  and 
heare  all  the  covenauntes  that  the  patriot,  the  governour,  aldermen,  one 
common  counceller  or  one  commoner  or  3  of  them  of  the  sayde  colonie  of 
which  the  patriot  or  governour  must  bee  one,  shall  undergoe  to  any  ad- 
venturer that  sendeth  servauntes  thither,  or  any  trades  men  that  shall 
trust  them  with  wares,  for  such  colonies  as  are  raised  there,  they  shall  give 
warrant  under  the  scale  of  the  colonye,  before  5  of  their  councell  there. 
And  the  councell  there  sendeing  their  letters  of  credence  to  the  councell 
heare,  they  shall  binde  the  colonie  whome  the  letters  concerne  to  performe 
all  covenauntes  that  they  shall  undergoe.  Thease  covenauntes  must  bee 
acknowledged  and  sealed  heare  before  the  Treasurer  and  his  deputie  and 
foure  councellers,  and  then  they  must  stand  as  a  statute  to  binde  and 
make  lyable  all  the  goodes  and  persons  of  any  personall  adventurers  in  the 
sayde  colonies,  the  arest  of  them  or  their  goodes  to  bee  made  either  heare 
or  theare.  The  like  shall  bee  done  for  all  coUonies  that  shall  bee  raised 
heare,  certificcate  being  made  by  the  councell  heare,  of  their  warrauntes 
acknowledged  in  courte,  and  this  shall  binde  all  their  goodes  and  persons 
theare  to  bee  aunsweareable  to  any  seasure  that  shall  be  made  for  not 
performeing  the  covenauntes  signed  and  sealed  as  aforesayde.  This 
assureance  as  well  of  their  owne  goodes  they  adventure  as  all  the  goodes  of 
that  colonie  wherein  they  adventure,  will  give  such  satisfaction  to  adven- 
turers, that  shall  either  have  sonnes,  brothers,  or  kindred  that  they  meane  to 
doe  good  too,  that  they  shall  neede  onely  to  lend  them  their  adventurers 
for,  5,  6,  or  7  yeares,  as  the  colonie  and  they  canne  agree,  and  then  they 
may  have  their  moneys  repayed. 

Moreover  because  where  the  busienesse  of  the  commonwealth  is  left  to 
manye,  there  everie  one  putteing  it  of  [q^]  noething  is  donne,  therefore 
our  Councell  in  England  nominateing  9  persons  (whome  they  shall  thinke 
meete)  to  us,  wee  will  make  choice  of  3  of  those  9  to  bee  principall  magis- 


428  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

trates  planteing  them  in  each  province  one,  which  shall  have  power  to 
see  each  magistrate,  counceller  patriot  and  governour  to  execute  their 
office,  to  see  the  lawes  and  orders  observed,  and  to  execute  the  decrees  of 
our  councells  as  our  shreifes  doe  in  England.  And  thease  being  capeable 
of  the  generall  commaund  of  the  forces  throughout  tlieir  severall  provinces 
when  the  Councell  of  State  shall  put  the  sword  in  their  handes,  they  must 
onely  have  power  to  censure  indite  and  suspend,  but  hee  must  have  noe 
jurisdiction.  Thease  3  magistrates  having  soe  good  alloweances  as  the 
plantacion  will  afforde  them,  they  shall  settle  their  estates  in  England  and 
have  noe  estates  in  Virginea,  everie  one  haveing  certayne  men  allowed 
them  for  their  guard  by  the  collonie.  And  houldeing  their  places  for  a 
time  limited  by  us  and  our  Councell  in  England  and  removeing  them  from 
province  to  province  as  wee  shall  thinke  meete.  Thease  wee  appoynte  to 
bee  our  marshall  governour,  and  are  to  take  their  directions,  both  of  take- 
ing  upp  and  layeing  downe  the  sword  accordeing  to  their  commissions  by 
the  councell  of  state  in  Virginea  graunted  and  giveing  ane  accoumpte  of 
their  actions  to  the  sayde  councell,  at  their  comeing  out  of  the  feilde. 

Furthermore  wee  considering  that  this  greate  power  given  amongst  our 
magistrates  councells  and  governoures  may  (as  wee  have  formerly  shewed 
in  the  lawe  provided  against  the  abuses  of  the  sayde  soveraigne  power) 
prove  to  bee  the  undoeing  of  our  obedient  subjectes  that  are  to  live  under 
it  and  bee  commaunded  by  it,  And  soe  may  turne  to  the  ruine  of  the  com- 
monwealth, Thearefore  it  concerneing  the  whole  bodie  politicke  aswell  as 
everie  particuler  member,  that  it  may  bee  the  better  looked  unto,  and  the 
more  severely  punished,  wee  doe  ordayne  a  Sj^ndex  or  magistracie,  framed 
out  of  the  5  orders  or  degrees,  3  a  peece  out  of  everie  order,  that  shall  soe 
often  as  the  generall  parlament  meetes  have  power  to  enquire,  examine, 
trye  and  adjudge  (as  neede  shall  require)  all  the  greate  councellers  either 
of  the  state  or  of  the  provinces,  the  patriotes,  the  governours,  or  any  other 
that  shall  have  the  administration  of  justice  within  any  of  our  sayde 
provinces  or  collonies.  And  whichsoever  of  them  shall  bee  found  guiltie 
of  oppression  or  the  encroacheing  farther  uppon  our  soveraigne  power  then 
to  him  or  them  or  [is]  limited  by  thease  our  orders,  or  warranted  by  our 
councell  of  state,  they  shall  have  power  to  punish  them  accordeing  to  the 
lawes,  either  with  losse  of  life,  goodes  or  banishment.  The  goodes  of 
which  offendoures,  wee  will  bestowe  one  [on]  the  publique,  whoe  havemg

caught  the  wolves  and  stripped  them  shall  have  the  fell  for  their  paynes. 
Noe  scentence  must  passe  in  this  magistracie  under  10  voices,  none  of 
death  under  13"'°  This  magistracie  must  continue  dureing  the  tune  of 
the  Parlament.  Everie  counceller  or  magistrate  that  shall  bee  ques- 
tioned by  this  magistracie,  must  stand  8  dayes  subject  to  this  inquisition 
and  triall,  in  which  time  it  shall  bee  lawfull  for  any  man  to  accuse  him, 
and  after  wardes  being  acquitted  he  shall  have  a  certificate  under  the 
handes  of  thease  magistrates,  certiefieing  his  integritie  in  his  place,  which 
may  remahie  by  him  as  a  merke  of  honour  to  him  and  his  posteritie.  To 
choose  this  magistracie,  there  must  bee  a  provinciall  parlament  called, 
one  out  of  each  order  of  the  5  orders  in  everie  corporation,  which  being 
mette  and  the  orders  sorted  and  severed  by  themselves,  they  must  write 
everie  one  his  name  to  whome  they  give  their  voices,  and  then  the  partie 
out  of  everie  order  which  hath  the  most  voices  must  stand  as  choosen  for 
this  magistracie.  Thease  magistrates  shall  bee  called  the  Protectoures  of 
the  commonwealth  dureing  the  time  of  their  magistracie. 

To  the  purpose  thearefore  that  wee  may  forthewith  have  thease  our  orders 
lawes  and  forme  of  governement,  put  in  execution,  wee  doe  first  charge 
and  ordayne  that  all  our  councellers  in  Virginea  shall  perswade  and  pre- 
pare first  and  especially  the  ould  planters  and  all  other  adventurers 
that  are  planted  there  and  have  servauntes,  to  devide  themselves  into 
consorteshipps  of  30"'^^  or  50""'  to  bee  principall  men  in  thease  our  par- 
ticular collonies,  and  that  they  planteing  themselves  as  neere  one  to  the 
other  as  may  bee,  will  prepare  houses  for  certayne  other  planters  or  serv- 
auntes that  shall  be  sent  to  them,  of  whome  they  shall  take  charge,  they 
being  payed  aswell  for  those  their  houses  as  for  their  undertakeing  the 
charge  of  servauntes,  by  them  that  shall  enter  or  adventure  into  con- 
sorteshippe  with  them.  And  that  such  our  councellers,  as  have  estates  in 
England  or  Ireland  and  such  other  of  the  planters  as  canne  procure  300 
men  to  joyne  with  them,  to  bee  suretyes  one  for  each  other  that  within  7 
yeares  they  shaU  purchase  estates  in  England,  to  such  a  value  as  shall  bee 
thought  meete.     Thease  shall  be  allowed  to  bee  patriotes. 

And  wee  doe  farther  will  and  charge  our  councell  in  England  tliat  the}' 
give  furtherance  to  all  such  as  shall  bee  soe  consorted,  to  supplie  them  with 
planters  that  haveing  estate  heare  may  bee  either  patriotes  or  of  the  order

of  governoures.  And  to  cause  adventurers  that  will  onely  send  servauntes 
thither  to  joyne  with  those  ould  planters,  giveing  them  reward  for  their 
paynes,  and  for  such  hundredes  as  are  now  planted  onely  with  tenauntes 
or  servauntes,  to  cause  the  ould  planters  that  are  freehoulders  to  joyne 
and  plante  with  them,  and  likewise  to  send  to  them  patriotes  and  gov- 
ernoures that  have  estates  in  England,  to  plante  amongst  them,  that  the 
ould  planters  may  both  helpe  to  instruct  them  and  keepe  them  to  their 
laboures.  And  the  colonic  may  bee  aunsweareable,  both  to  the  state  for 
their  allegeance  and  to  the  adventurers  for  their  adventures  and  that  they 
will  not  graunt  any  farther  patentes  heareafter  to  any  other  but  such  as 
shall  bee  enabled  by  this  our  forme  to  take  them. 

And  in  regard  that  our  planters  in  Virginea  may  bee  the  better  furthered 
by  the  companye  in  England  wee  doe  ordayne  that  everie  coUonie  after 
it  is  300  strong  shall  appoynte  3  deputies  of  their  principall  adventurers 
whome  they  best  trust,  resideing  in  or  about  London  or  Plimouth,  whereof 
one  of  them  being  nominated  to  bee  the  principall  shall  bee  authorrized 
to  bee  present  at  all  consultations  with  the  counccU  of  Virginea  and  New 
England,  to  consulte  uppon  the  election  of  officers  belongeing  to  the 
courtes  there,  and  about  contractes  with  the  King  or  companie  about 
auditeing  the  accomptes.  The  whole  order  and  classis  of  thcase  men, 
being  tearmed  the  preconsulters,  shaU  have  a  negative  voice  to  staye 
and  hinder  all  thinges  that  shall  bee  prejudiciall  to  the  planters  in  Virginea 
giveing  in  their  names,  their  consentes  or  their  denialls  for  the  matter 
questioned  in  writeing,  the  other  two  deputies  shall  bee  as  agentes  and 
factors  to  buy  and  sell  the  goodes  transported  and  returned  to  and  from 
Virginea. 

An  wee  doe  further  charge  our  counceU  in  Virginea,  that  in  the  interim 
whilst  thease  thinges  are  doeing,  they  will  send  out  certayne  flatt  bot- 
tomed vessells  to  discover  to  the  southward  where  the  best  places  (most 
especially  for  health)  are  to  plant  one  [on],  and  that  they  will  hkewise 
prepare  long  and  large  vessels  flatt  bottomed,  like  those  they  tearme  flutes 
in  the  Low  Countries,  that  in  transportemg  our  men  they  may  laye  drye 
in  them  till  their  houses  are  made  or  built. 

For  the  seateing  and  ordering  thease  severall  plantacions^,because_^  they 
require  a  good  judgement  uppon  the  veiue  of  the  place  (there  haveing 


BEFORE  DECEMBER  7,  1623  431 

beene  either  none  or  verie  slight  discoveries  in  that  kinde),  wee  must 
leave  it  to  the  wisedome  and  judgement  of  you  our  councell  in  Virginea, 
but  wee  knowing  the  manye  inconveniences  that  doe  heape  themselves 
together  both  uppon  the  plantacion  and  the  governement  in  our  planteing 
in  grosse,  which  noething  but  a  potent  domesticke  enimye  should  enforce 
us  to,  And  considering  that  the  naturalls  of  the  cuntrie  are  soe  weake, 
that  the  strenght  and  largenesse  of  the  cuntrie  is  soe  greate,  soe  as  by 
the  fortiefieing  of  the  mouthes  of  the  rivers  and  keepeing  the  center  and 
middle  province  of  the  plantacion  strong,  And  knoweing  that  the  devideing 
of  our  forces  in  soe  strong  a  cuntrie  will  bee  a  principall  meanes  not  onely 
to  encrease  the  strenght  of  them  by  our  retireing  fightes  from  one  collonie 
to  the  other,  tyering,  debOiitateing  and  anoyeing  an  assayleing  enunie 
and  draweing  them  to  all  places  of  disadvantage,  but  alsoe  to  bee  a  special! 
helpe  to  the  attayneing  of  all  other  our  defined  endes,  Wee  doe  ordayne 
therefore  3  provinces,  a  southerne,  a  middle,  and  a  northorne  province, 
planteing  our  collonies  in  them,  accordeing  as  wee  shall  finde  the  rivers  to 
lye,  planteing  not  above  2  collonies  one  one  river.  One  at  the  falls  to  make 
bridges  to  coste  the  cuntrye,  and  anoether  not  farre  of  from  the  mouthes 
of  the  sayde  riveres,  and  they  being  noe  farther  of  [off]  in  distance  one  from 
the  other  but  that  they  may  second  one  the  other  in  3  or  4  dayes  bj^  land, 
which  manner  of  planteing  and  seateing  them,  will  not  onely  bee  and  [an] 
impulsive  cause  enforceing  by  necessitie  the  continuance  of  the  governe- 
ment by  us  now  ordayned,  but  alsoe  and  [an]  especiall  meanes  of  gayneing 
healthie  places  to  plant  one  [on],  a  meanes  to  enlarge  our  dommions,  a 
meanes  to  encrease  our  navie,  a  meanes  to  discover  the  comodities  of  the 
cuntrie,  a  meanes  to  make  tame  and  civill  the  Indyans,  a  meanes  to  make 
our  conmiaunders  the  better  agree,  a  meanes  to  keepe  our  collonies  from 
generall  mutinies  and  oppresseing  each  other,  a  meanes  to  keepe  them  from 
makeing  leagues  and  aydeing  each  other  agaynst  the  soveraigne  councell, 
a  meanes  to  baUance  one  province  and  collonie  by  the  other,  a  meanes  to 
make  them  joyne  against  anyone  that  shall  rebell  against  the  generall 
governement,  and  finally  a  meanes  to  make  the  patriotes  greate  within 
their  owne  collonies  and  wastes  adjoyneing  to  them,  thus  planteing  them 
and  equalling  them  in  number,  seateing,  ordering,  and  fortiefieing  them, 
our  rehgion,  discipluie,  governement,  eclesiasticall  and  civill,  the  ordering 
of  our  families,  and  the  tying  of  the  naturall  Virgineanes  all  to  coheare 
accordeing  to  our  forme,  everie  thing  will  bee  soe  united  and  made  one  in

dependencie,  as  the  essence  and  being  of  it  shall  naturally  depend  one  our 
soveraignetye. 

Now  because  wee  will  shewe  you  that  the  duties  of  commaundeing  and 
obeyeing  are  mutuall,  haveing  hitherto  endeavoured  to  winne  you  to  a 
loveing  obedience  of  thease  our  lawes  and  orders  sett  downe  in  this  forme, 
as  wee  intend  wholely  for  your  good  and  advauntage,  wee  by  waye  of 
retributeing  our  love  for  your  obedience  doe  promise  that  heareafter  if  you 
shall  either  finde  out  there  groweing,  or  plante  there  any  commoditie 
that  shall  bee  of  necessarie  use  in  any  of  our  dominions,  that  then  payeing 
us  our  customes  and  impostes,  and  being  able  fullye  to  supplie  us  with 
the  sayde  commodities,  you  shall  have  onely  the  bringeing  them  in.  And 
because  wee  knowe  that  this  spreadeing  and  groweing  quallitie  doth 
necessariely  require  a  pubhque  groweing  stocke,  in  performance  of  this 
our  promise,  wee  doe  give  unto  such  as  shall  desire  to  plant  estates  in 
England,  the  sole  importation  of  tobaccoe,  that  you  may  plant  estates 
aswell  in  England  as  in  Virginea,  wee  doe  enjojme  you  that  if  by  restrajme- 
ing  it  that  it  come  not  two  fast  into  England,  and  by  keepeing  it  in  banke 
heare,  it  shall  prove  worth  4  or  5  pounds,  yee  shall  bee  payde  halfe  of  it  in 
Virginea  in  commodities  and  servauntes  at  easie  and  reasonable  rates, 
and  the  other  halfe  shall  remaine  in  banke  in  England,  in  good  handes 
(you  receaveing  G  in  the  hundredth)  to  imploye  as  you  shall  thinke  meete, 
The  surplusage  proffite  above  4  or  5  being  imployed  as  a  treasurie  for 
the  publique.  Wee  will  order  that  there  shall  bee  servauntes  and  cattle 
equallie  sent  to  the  collonies,  the  benifitte  of  whome  they  shall  have  the 
4"'.  parte  of  it  for  takcing  the  charge  of  them. 

And  because  wee  doe  knowe  that  a  sett  and  frugall  habite  is  the  best 
meanes  to  advance  a  groweing  commonwealth  to  the  one  that  yce  may 
banish  superfluitie  and  that  everie  degree  may  bee  knowne  by  their  hab- 
bites,  wee  doe  charge  and  commaund  you  to  sett  downe  amongst  yourselves 
certayne  frugall  and  inchangeable  fashions,  for  each  degree  to  weare, 
giveing  to  the  ould  planters  some  noate  of  honour  to  distinguish  them 
from  others. 

And  that  this  may  bee  the  better  donnc,  wee  doe  ordayne,  that  there 
shall  bee  a  mcgasine  for  the  publicjue,  the  stocke  whereof  shall  bee  raised 


BEFORE  DECEMBER  7,  1G2S  433 

out  of  the  ould  debtes  and  the  fines  of  such  as  have  abused  the  governe- 
ment,  which  stocke  shall  still  bee  upheald  and  increased  as  the  plantacion 
increaseth  aswell  by  the  benifitte  of  retourne  of  commodities,  as  by  one 
4"".  parte  of  the  pubhque  servauntes  labours,  by  and  [an]  increase  of 
the  4'*'.  parte  of  the  cattell,  and  by  a  rent  to  bee  reserved  out  of  the  landes 
where  the  publique  servauntes  shall  bee  planted,  when  they  are  once  made 
free  tenauntes. 

We  haveing  thus  not  provided  you  a  meanes  to  plant  estates  in  England 
but  put  you  into  the  waye  how  it  shall  bee  donne,  our  busienesse  will  bee 
soe  to  order  the  seateing,  fortiefieing  and  the  manner  of  the  spreadeing  of 
your  collonies,  that  it  maye  bee  for  your  healthes,  and  strengthening  of 
you,  soe  onely,  as  you  may  not  strengthen  yourselves  against  our  publique 
state.  And  because  soveraigne  seates  are  onely  to  bee  used  where  the 
person  of  the  soveraigne  hath  his  continual!  abydeing,  therefore  wee  doe 
ordayne  that  noe  colonie  shall  bee  planted  one  [on]  the  mouth  of  any  navie- 
gable  river,  where  the  channels  maye  be  commaunded  or  shall  take  any 
soveraigne  seate  naturally  strong  to  commaund  both  sea  and  land,  but 
shall  leave  the  mouthes  of  all  the  riveres  to  bee  fortiefied  in  that  manner 
the  state  shall  thinke  fitt,  onely  with  small  fortes  bastions  or  bullworkes 
that  maye  contayne  20  or  30""  men  a  peece,  to  handle  their  ordinaunce 
to  beate  and  commaund  the  channells.  But  because  prepotencie  is  the 
principall  thing  that  you  must  all  take  heede  of,  dwarfes  and  gyantes 
never  agreeing  well  togeather  in  one  familie,  ranke  or  order,  wee  will  leave 
this  to  your  cares  whome  it  doth  most  especially  concerne  to  looke  unto  it, 
willeing  and  commaundeing  you  that  noe  peece  of  grounde  within  the 
degrees  before  limited,  shall  bee  taken  and  fortiefied,  by  any  our  subjectes 
the  planters  theare,  but  first  a  commission  shall  bee  directed  to  certayne 
surveyoures  some  of  which  shall  bee  well  experienced  in  fortifiecation,  a 
record  being  kept  of  the  names  of  the  commissioners,  togeather  with  the 
condition  of  the  place,  the  quallitie,  quantitie  and  manner  of  the  forti- 
fiecation by  them  all  owed  to  bee  made,  that  not  onely  thease  commis- 
sioners if  they  shall  connive  and  suffer  such  fortes  and  places  of  advauntage 
to  bee  taken  and  fortiefied  may  receave  condigne  punishment  therefore, 
but  alsoe  it  may  make  all  such  planters  as  shall  fortiefie  contrarie  to  the 
alloweance  of  the  state  to  bee  unexcuseable,  which  offence  accordeing  to 
our  lawes  of  England,  wee  doe  ordayne  that  it  shall  bee  fellonie. 


434  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

Now  for  the  manner  of  the  fortiefiecation  that  they  may  bee  all  equall, 
wee  will  and  commaund  that  there  shall  bee  one  sett  forme  for  all,  and  that 
citties  bee  fortiefied  with  bricke  and  stone  walls  onely,  not  of  any  greate 
thickenesse,  but  battalemented  one  the  tojipe,  flanked  without  and  tarrased 
within  more  for  comelynesse  then  strenght,  planteing  them  either  uppon 
easie  and  accessable  assentes,  or  else  one  levell  groundes,  by  small  rivers  as 
farre  from  marshes  and  ill  aires  as  may  Ijee,  not  suffering  any  to  fortiefie 
within  gunneshott  of  the  banke  of  any  greate  navigable  river,  neither  one 
collonie  to  plant  one  both  sides  theareof  that  they  may  not  annoye  either 
those  that  plant  above  them,  or  such  their  neightboure  coUonies  as  shall 
abutte  againste  them,  but  wee  would  have  them  plante  one  [on]  such  small 
riveres  as  are  fordeable,  and  wheare  bridges  may  bee  made  to  passe  them, 
there  they  shall  plant  one  both  sides,  if  the  riveres  bee  not  the  boundes 
bettwixte  two  collonies,  in  which  cases  none  of  the  sayde  collonies  shall 
plant  within  gunne  shotte  of  them,  the  fisheing  being  common  to  both. 
One  [on]  thease  riveres  if  wee  shall  plant  our  townes  in  the  middest,  our 
wastes  and  commons  next  and  our  cuntrie  villages  last,  makeing  them  soe 
strong  as  they  maye  bee  sufficient  defences  agaynest  the  Indyans,  and  the 
placeing  those  villages  in  and  [an]  orderlye  distance  one  from  the  other, 
everye  planter  that  is  but  of  2  or  3  yearcs  standeing  will  knowe  his  station, 
the  manner  of  the  fortiefiecation  and  buildeing  aswell  as  the  Romans 
knew  their  campe.  But  for  the  manner  of  spreadeing  and  devideing  our 
collonies,  wee  will  take  example  by  Iving  Alfridde  whoe  first  devidcd  Eng- 
land into  several  sheires  or  sextions  and  appoynted  over  everie  sheire  and 
[an]  earle  to  commaunde  his  forces  theare,  which  sheires  hee  alsoe  devided 
into  lesser  partes  whereof  some  bee  called  Lothia  [lathesl]  of  the  Saxon 
worde,  which  signiefieth  to  assemble,  others  he  tearmed  hundredes,  because 
those  that  commaund  over  them,  had  jurisdiction  over  a  hundredth  pledges, 
others  the  tearmed  tytheinges,  soe  named  because  there  was  in  each  of 
them  ten  persons,  whearein  each  one  was  suretye  and  pleadge  for  the  others 
good  abeareing,  and  whatsoever  hee  was  that  was  not  of  creddite  to  bee 
receaved  into  one  of  thease  tytheinges  hee  was  either  subject  to  the  marshall 
law,  or  else  committed  to  prison  and  there  made  worke  like  and  [a7)]  idle 
droane.  if  this  course  bee  now  taken  in  Virginea  and  that  the  Indyane 
within  the  wastes  adjoyneing  to  the  collonies,  were  by  your  gentle  usage 
drawne  into  thease  polliticke  orders,  whereby  each  collonie  should  have 


EARLY  DECEMBER,  1623  435 

their  propper  Indyans  beelongeing  to  them,  whoe  seeth  not  what  greate 
benifitte  would  arise  to  the  plantacion  theareby.

Right  ho''!''  after  10  yeares  service  in  the  warres  in  the  summer  time,  and 
at  my  study  in  the  wynter,  whereby  in  some  measure  I  informed  my 
Judgment  in  publiqu[e]  buisinesse,  and  7  yeares  since  now  latehe  spent  in 
observing  the  abuses  of  the  Virginia  Company,  and  studdying  the  meanes 
to  rectifie  them,  being  forced  and  necessitated  to  be  an  earnest  follower, 
and  studdyer  of  the  same  by  losse  of  my  Estate,  I  may  now  Claime  to  my- 
selfe  the  right  of  being  Maister  in  that  art,  Challenging  all  others  that 
shall  oppose  what  I  write,  and  makeing  it  good  that  it  is  impossible  for 
any  one  (that  shall  newly  enter  into  the  buisinesse)  to  be  able  to  setle 
this  Plantacon.  I  will  take  this  proposicon  for  the  ground  of  my  maister- 
peece,  and  proue  by  right  reason  (wch  Plato  saith  is  the  ground  of  pollicie) 
That  honors,  hberties,  and  freedomes,  togeather  w'h  returne  of  profit,  or- 
dered to  the  Workeing  of  our  pollitique  End^,  would  plant  Virginia,  and 
worke  those  effects  wee  all  aimed  at. 

From  this  ground  I  raise  these  6  head^.^ 

1.  First  I  vndertake  to  show  the  meanes  to  draw  a  sufficient  Nomber  of 
men  that  haue  good  Estates  here,  to  plant  in  Vii-ginia,  w*h  their  persons 
&  good^,  and  to  Cause  the  planters  in  Virginia  to  plant  Estates  in  England. 

'  This  copy  is  in  Sir  Nathaniel  Rich's  hand.  It  reads  in  some  minor  points  as  though  he  I  ad 
misread  the  original.  It  has  been  compared  with  Additional  MSS.  12496,  fo.  454,  and  differs  in 
some  important  particulars.  The  document  in  the  British  IVIuseum  is  addressed  to  the  Loni.s  of 
the  Council  instead  of  to  the  Lord  Treasurer.  Differences  are  indicated  in  the  footnotes  following. 
Still  a  tliird  text,  addressed  to  the  Lord  Treasurer,  is  No.  6157  of  the  manuscripts  of  Lord  Sackville 
preserved  at  Knole  Park,  Kent,  and  printed,  under  the  heading,  "Captain  John  Bargrave's  Pro- 
posals", in  the  American  Historical  Review,  XXVII,  pp.  511-514.  It  seems  to  be  a  later  version 
than  the  one  here  printed  (running  to  "seventhly''  in  the  early  paragraphs  instead  of  "si.xthly"), 
yet  is  endorsed  by  the  Lord  Treasurer's  secretary  as  receiverl  December  7.

2.  Secondlie  so  to  seaver  and  divide  the  facultyes  of  sov9aintie,  and  the 
Comaund  of  the  forces  amongst  those  men  so  estated  that  they  shall  never 
meete  vnited  in  power,  but  to  advance  our  politique  end  of  holding  the 
Plantacon  ef  §to§  England. 

3.  Thirdlie  by  makeing  vse  of  the  natural]  strength,  and  largenes  of  y" 
place,  so  to  marshall  those  men,  as  they  shall  not  onelie  make  the  Plan- 
tacon to  spread,  and  growe,  to  find  out  the  best  Comodities,  and  inlarge 
the  KingC  Dominions,  but  they  shall  secure  it  both  from  forraine  Enimies, 
and  inable  it  to  give  lawes  to  the  Domesticke  Indians. 

4.  Fourthly,  the  imploying  of  those  men  there  to  make  the  best  &  sud- 
dainest  returnes  hither. 

5.  Fiftly  the  mannageing  and  ordering  those  returnes  so,  as  they  shall  not 
onely  supply  and  mantayne  the  Plantacon  •w%  apparrell  and  necessaries 
but  it  shall  make  a  publique  stocke  and  Treasurie,  that  should  increase 
as  the  Plantacon  increaseth. 

6.  Sixtlie  and  lastlie  the  dooeing  of  all  theis  thinges  by  way  of  right  and 
Interest  to  the  mantenance  of  Justice,  and  peace,  and  to  the  Hono'  of 
God,  our  King,  and  State. 

All  theis  quallityes  being  treated  of  in  five  seu9all  Treatises  are  lastlie 
Composed  into  one  forme  wch  may  aptlie  be  tearmed  militarie  Intendencie 
by  Tribe,  it  being  a  way  not  onelie  to  plant  Garrisons  without  pay,  but 
each  Garrison  bringing  w'h  it  a  Certaine  Revenew  to  the  Crowne,  it  shall 
tie  Virginia  as  fast  to  England  as  if  it  were  one  Terra  firma  w'h  it. 

The  hint?  of  it  I  had  from  Charles  the  5'^,  and  if  he  himselfe  or  King 
Philip  his  Sonne,  had  vsed  the  like  policie  in  the  West  Indyes,  low  Coun- 
tries, Millaine,  Naples,  and  the  rest  of  his  provinces  to  Mantayne  his 
Soveraigntye  there,  he  had  not  spent  so  many  [2]  Millions  to  keepe  Garri- 
sons as  he  hath  done,  neither  would  his  provinces  be  so  readie  to  fall  from 
him  as  now  they  wilbe  if  his  plate  fleet  should  faile  him. 

When  I  shall  see  the  Companie  incouraged,  and  the  Comission  goe  for- 
ward, so  as  the  delinquents  being  knowne  to  ther  King  from  honest  men, 
a  stocke  may  be  gayned  out  of  th'  abuses  of  the  Government,  and  that 
this  forme  be  setled,  I  doubt  not  but  to  procure  8  or  10  Gentlemen  that 


EABLY  DECEMBER,  1623  437 

shall  haue  7  or  8000''  p  Ann  revenew  to  goe  as  Comissioners  into  Virginia, 
to  setle  it,  and  to  be  the  heack  of  the  first  Colloneyes;  and  all  they  shall 
demand  of  his  Ma*^  is,  that  he  will  grant  them  the  wardshipp  of  their 
heyres  if  they  shall  dye  in  thei^  seruice  now  at  their  first  gocing.  And  if 
his  Ma'-'  will  but  grant  me  releife  out  of  the  Imployment  of  the  said 
stocke,  I  will  vndertake  on  payne  of  my  life,  that  what  is  wanting  to  per- 
forme  the  buisines,  the  Planter  shall  supplie,  and  when  this  is  done  I 
may  glory  in  the  worke  and  bragg  that  I  haue  helped  the  state  to  meanes, 
shewed  them  the  way  and  helped  them  w'h  Instruments  to  Conquer  and 
keepe  in  subieccon  to  England  a  State  that  may  grow  to  be  as  great  an 
Empire  as  the  King  of  Spaynes,  the  distance  of  place  no  way  hindering  it, 
to  the  bono''  and  inriching  of  o''  King  and  State  &  to  the  rclcifc  of  Thou- 
sands of  poore  people.^ 

I  euer  said  and  so  I  exprest  my  selfe  in  my  Articles  two  yeares  since  at  the 
Councell  boord,  that  if  the  buisnes  w*h  the  Company  were  not  tenderlie 
handled,  tfeft till  this  pubUque  stocke  was  gayned,  and  this  forme  were  framed, 
and  setled  by  the  Company,  we  should  beginne  at  the  wrong  end,  and  it 
would  hinder  the  worke;  this  takeing  away  of  the  Patent  being  a  device  of 
the  delinquents  (like  some  other  they  haue  formerlie  vsed)  hath  so  madded 
the  Company,  that  whereas  there  is  80  Articles  put  in  against  the  former 
Gou9no''s,  15  of  them  being  against  the  AccomptS,  and  but  3  examined 
they  let  all  goe  now  at  sixe  and  seauen,  and  ^  will  medle  no  further ;  and 
that  there  Cannot  be  a  more  pleasing  thing  to  the  delinquents  any  one 
may  see  it  by  some  of  their  earnest  following  it.  For  my  part  I  neuer 
durst  seeke  to  take  away  the  populer  Government  here,  partlie  because  the 
deliverie  vp  of  Patents  doth  weaken  the  Confidence  that  Patentees  should 
haue  in  ^  them,  and  the  Patent  now  granted  being  to  the  Company,  Con- 
sisting of  the  Adventurer,  and  Planter,  and  the  Gou9nment  being  now  in 
the  Company  here,  if  the  Company  will  by  Consenting  to  this  Forme, 
transferre  the  Gou9nment  to  the  Planter  (to  whom  of  right  it  belonges) 
there  is  no  necessitie  that  the  Patent  must  be  delivered,  partUe  because 
there  must  by  necessitie  be  such  Correspondencie  betweene  the  Planter  in

Virginia,  and  the  Adventurer  here,  that  the  Planter  must  make  noe  lawes 
to  bind  the  Estates  of  the  Adventurer,  but  he  must  Consent  to  it  either  by 
himselfe,  or  some  other;  for  otherwise  no  man  will  adventure.  Partly 
because  the  Consent  of  all  the  Parties  interested  to  the  forme  will  make  it 
the  more  firme,  and  ppetuall,  parthe  because  all  Changes  of  Gou9nm* 
should  be  insensible,  gentle,  &  [3]  easie.  Parthe  because  this  Consent  by 
voices  doth  make  many  adventure  that  otherwise  would  not,  Partly 
because  I  made  a  doubt  whether  the  King  would  take  the  name  of  the 
Plantacon  as  §a§  worke  of  his  owne  till  he  saw  it  was  able  to  subsist  and 
defend  it  selfe  against  forreyne  and  domesticke  power.  Partly  because 
vnder  the  name  of  the  publique  (w^i  is  the  King^  in  right  of  his  Sou9aintie) 
all  the  benifit  of  the  pubhque  landC  &  seruant^  will  returne  vnto  him  though 
he  be  no  more  seene  in  the  buisines  then  form91ie  he  hath  beene.  Lasthe 
the  plantacon  being  divided  into  petty  CoUonyes  of  300  in  each  one,  if 
those  CoUonies  shall  nominate  3  Adventurers  here,  two  of  them  to  be  their 
Agents  to  doe  their  buisines,  as  the  Comittees  doe  now,  and  the  third  to 
preconsult  and  make  Contracts  for  the  Planter  w'h  the  Iving  or  Company, 
the  whole  Classis  of  those  preconsulters  haueing  a  Negatiue  voice ;  theis  will 
p'uent  all  wrong  done  to  the  Plantacon,  and  there  will  nothing  remayne 
but  the  very  name  of  the  Company. 

The  Company  feares  that  this  takeing  away  the  Patent  before  the  abuses 
were  examined  was  hatched  at  Alderman  Johnsons  house  at  Bowe,  at  the 
KingC  being  there,  that  the  King  is  now  prest  to  it  by  S''  Thomas  Smithes 
Freind^  of  the  Bed  Chamber,  and  all  is  done  to  Conceale  the  falshood  of  his 
AccomptC,  and  the  grossenes  of  their  Gou9nment  from  his  Ma**^  knowl- 
edge ^  They  feare  hkewise  that  S'  Tho:  Smith,  S'  Samuell  Argoll,  and 
Alderman  Johnson  standing  Cleare  in  the  King^  Eyes,  and  the  Gou9ninent 
being  framed.  That  they  may  doe  w%  the  Planter  and  Adventurer  what 
they  list,  all  their  privildges  and  rights  being  taken  from  them  they  wilbe 
made  their  Gou9no''s  who  haue  beene  the  principall  abft§u§sers  of  them, 
and  this  that  side  bragg^  of.  Some  of  the  Corn's  also  answearing  Peti- 
coners  that  it  is  to  no  purpose  for  them  to  medle  any  further,  being  the 
King  hath  declared  himselfe  to  take  away  the  Government  from  the 

'  In  Additional  MSS.  12496,  instead  of  the  lengthy  statement  from  this  point,  Captain  Bargrave 
prays  that  the  Company  be  commanded  to  make  good  their  complaints  before  the  Commissioners 
and  that  a  committee  be  appointed  to  examine  and  amend  the  form  of  government.

Company,  and  to  put  it  into  the  hand^  of  twelve  Councello''s,  that  may 
right  their  causes. 

The  way  to  right  all  wilbe  the  setting  forward  of  the  Comission,  the  forceing 
the  Company  to  make  good  their  Complaints,  the  nomynating  a  Comittee 
from  the  board,  or  otherwise  to  examine,  and  approue  of  the  forme  of 
Gou9nment  that  shalbe  tendered  to  the  Company,  and  when  they  shall  see 
that  Justice  is  done,  this  stocke  is  hke  to  be  gayned,  and  that  this  forme  of 
Gou9nm'  w^h  the  King  and  State  doth  presse  on  them  is  no  such  Bulbegger 
as  they  need  to  be  afraid  of,  but  framed  according  to  right,  tending  to  the 
good  of  all  parties  interested,  for  the  Companies  ease,  and  to  take  away  the 
blame  from  them.  If  any  thing  miscarrie  for  want  of  Government,  the 
order  of  the  forme  placeing  the  same  men  in  the  Gou9nment  w°h  they 
themselues  would  G  choose  if  the  Gou9nment  should  remayne  in  their 
hands  and  they  being  by  the  said  forme  to  haue  their  adventures  secured  to 
them  by  the  whole  CoUonyes,  wherein  they  shall  adventure,  and  that  this 
is  all  the  hurt  that  is  intended  to  them;  I  make  no  doubt  but  the  States 
and  the  Companies  Ends  meeting  in  one  and  the  same  thing,  they  will 
imbrace  it,  and  the  buisines  will  goe  well  forward. 

I  know  (my  good  Lord)  that  in  Cases  of  necessitie  all  states  &  states  men, 
instead  of  following  straight  wayes  to  Compasse  their  ends  [4]  are  forced  to 
follow  more  obhque  and  Crooked,  the  greatnes  of  the  future  good  recom- 
penceth  the  present  ill.  So  Licurgus  although  his  pollicie  was  Aristo- 
oraticablc  §call§  Aristocraticall,  so  iust,  as  for  it  he  was  (of  the  Oracle) 
tearmed  beloued  of  the  GodS,  yet  notwithstandinge  he  being  necessitated 
to  set  vp  his  Gou9ment  by  Conspiracie,  and  force  he  was  likewise  Compelled 
to  Choose  all  his  first  Councell  out  of  the  Conspirators;  by  this  rule  of 
necessitie  Romulus  (as  Livie  saith  imitating  other  founders  of  Coinon 
Wealthes)  to  draw  people  to  his  new  built  Cittie,  erected  an  Assilum,  or 
Sanctuary  for  Outlawes,  men  indebted,  and  discontented  psons.  Junius 
Brutus  hkewise  in  the  desperate  Case  of  the  Citie  of  Rome,  after  the  battel 
of  Canne  was  forced  for  want  of  men  to  set  at  liberty  all  the  prisoners 
indebted,  and  to  discharge  their  debts  on  Condicon,  that  they  would 
serue  the  State;  although  in  theis  Examples  wee  in  our  necessitie  may 
intreate  Connivencie,  and  helpe  for  some  industrious  Gentlemen  indebted ; 
and  decaying  in  their  EstatS,  by  whose  Industrie  the  States  turne  may  be 
serued,  and  their  falling  houses  releived.     This  pollicy  no  question  is

tolerable  and  fitt,  but  that  theis  delinquents  seeing  their  leaudncs  like  to 
be  discouered,  should  meet  the  storme  in  the  force,  and  to  avoid  the 
obloquie  of  their  offences  should  be  suffred  to  Compound  vnder  hand,  and 
vnder  a  Colo""  of  their  loue  to  the  Plantacon,  and  a  desire  to  see  the  man- 
nageing  of  it,  by  Concealing  their  Wrongs  done,  should  thrust  all  the  dis- 
grace from  themselues  vpon  others,  it  being  a  most  sure  rule  that  nothing 
makes  a  State  more  florish  then  a  due  administracon  of  rewards  and 
punnishm**^,  this  must  needs  be  by  the  rule  of  state  intoUerable,  and  the 
more  intollerable  be  because  the  State  at  this  tyme  both  here  and  in

faculties  amongst  the  Councell,  and  Magistrates  in  Virginia,  wholy  Con- 
sisting in  the  severe  punnishment  of  all  incroachment  vpon  soueraigne

shall  suffer  the  same  punishm*  (that  the  Delinquents  should)  if  their  Com-

Complaints  in  the  name  of  the  Company  to  Cease,  because  such  punish- 
ment Could  not  be  inflicted  vpon  the  Companie  as  might  vpon  private 
psons,  whereby  they  did  for  a  long  time  hinder  the  proceedings  of  §the

Wee  receaved  you""  Letters  by  the  Bonny  Besse  and  the  George,  whervnto 
(though  divers  shipps  haue  since  retorned)  wee  haue  been  enforced  through 
the  absence  of  the  Gou9nor  To  defer  our  replie,  as  also  owt  of  our  desire 
to  enforme  you  of  other  accidents  and  pceedings. 

Wee  haue  to  ou''  vttermost  abihties  revenged  ourselves  vppone  the  Sal- 
vages havinge  vppon  this  river,  Cut  downe  theire  Corne  in  all  places  w'"''

Confederates,  burninge  downe  the  howses  they  had  reedified,  and  w**"  tlie

soe  served  the  rest,  yf  in  y'  tyme  of  our  gretest  scarcitie,  &  noe  reUcfe  to 
be  founde  amongste  y''  Enemyes)  want  of  meanes  to  feede  the  souldiers 
had  not  Constrayned  us  to  desiste. 

Notwthstandinge  y^  Gou'nor  as  soone  as  our  Corne  was  ripe,  sett  forwarde 
to  the  River  of  Potomak  to  settle  the  trade  w'h  ou""  freends,  and  to  revenge 
the  trecherie  of  y"  Pascoticons  and  theire  assocyates,  beinge  the  greatest

then  the  necessitie  of  the  Countrey,  could  consent  to,  enforced  him  to 
leaue  of  his  Chief  intentione  for  Ponunka, 

It  is  noe  smale  difficultie  and  griefe  vnto  us  to  mantaine  a  warr  by  vn-

doeinge  the  emynie  most  spoyle  falinge  owt  to  their  greatest  hindrance,  of 
this  the  Gou9nor  can  speake  by  experyence,  who  although  at  theire  ernest

night before  he  sawe  the  enymie,  was  petitioned  by  them  all  subscribed 
with  theire  handes,  that  they  might  haue  leaue  to  retourne,  lest  it  should 
proue  theire  vtter  vndoinge, 

Wheras  we  are  advised  by  you  to  obserue  rules  of  Justice  w*""  these  bar- 
berous  and  pfidious  enemys,  wee  hold  nothinge  iniuste,  that  may  tend  to 
theire  ruine,  (except  breach  of  faith)  Stratagems  were  ever  allowed  against 
all  enemies,  but  w*''  these  neither  fayre  Warr  nor  good  quarter  is  ever  to 
be  held,  nor  is  there  other  hope  of  theire  subversione,  who  ever  may  in-

Howsoeu''  ou''  intended  howse  of  entertaynment  was  not  builte,  for  w"''

and  that  w**"  more  convenience  in  ou''  oppinions,  then  in  publique  Guest

as  ernestly  for  it  as  we  did  for  the  former  supphe)  yett  it  is  nevertheless 
welcome,  rather  in  regarde  of  Varietie  then  necessitie. 

And  we  must  frely  pfess  y'  the  taxe  w*^*"  was  laide  vppon  you,  was  malitious

that  the  only  sale  of  fower  butt?  of  wyne  would  be  Sufficyent  to  clere  the

The  answer  of   Robert  Guyar   and  John  White   to   y*'  Complaint  and 
Petition  of  Cap'  John  Haruey  Esquier 

Whereas  it  is  obiected  that  Robert  Guyar  abetted  Jo°  White  to  make  a 
muteny  or  deuision  among  y"  shipps  Company,  it  is  denied  by  them  botli, 
y*  any  other  order  was  giuen  by  the  one,  or  rec'  by  thother  then  to  know  of 
the  shipps  Company,  whoe  were  wilhng,  &  whoe  not,  to  alter  y"  former 
designes  that  they  were  shipped  vpon,  w*""  out  any  mocion  of  perswading 
or  diswading  them  any  thing.  Intending  rather  for  the  good  of  Captaine 
Haruey  then  otherwise,  and  John  white  denieth  y'  hee  used  any  pswations, 
but  only  demauiided  ther  opinions 

fTor  Muteny  (if  any  be)  Robert  Guyar  holdeth  it  to  be  Comitted  against 
himselfe  by  Cap*  Haruey  &  his  Confederates  (hee  affirming  that  whoe  so 
would  not  runne  his  Course  hee  would  Cutt  his  throat,  in  regard  hee  knew 
none  of  the  shipp  to  haue  Comand  aboue  him,  Esteeming  him  selfe  m' 
&  Comaunder,  As  well  by  a  deed  vnder  the  hand  of  Cap'  Haruey  (w''*'  hee 
is  ready  to  pduce)  together  w"*  Cap'  Harueys  affirmation  both  ashoare  & 
aboard,  that  hee  Came  no  otherwise  then  a  passenger  aboard  the  shipp, 
As  by  a  Comission  hee  had  fro'  the  Company  of  Virginia  in  England,  w"'' 
Cap'  Haruey  gott  from  him  by  intreaty)  at  the  westerne  Islands  vnder

w'^''  Comission  hee  saieth  hee  hath  torne,  if  in  Contempt  hee  referreth  to 
y"  Censure  of  this  board 

As  for  the  roll  of  names  alleged  to  be  so  Impudenly  &  insolently  defined 
to  Cap'  Haruey,  they  doubt  but  it  wilbe  a  maneffestation,  that  they  meiit 
no  prejudice,  but  rather  benifitt  vnto  him,  that  thcrby  hee  might  Consider,

if  it  were  his  best  Course  to  vndertake  y''  Designe,  w'*"  vnwilling  men. 
Had  they  knowne  before  the'  Coming  out  of  this  voyage  of  the  Comissions 
&  Instructions  fro'  the  lords  of  his  Ma*'"'  Counsell  for  New  England  vnto 
Cap'  Haruey,  Doubtlesse  they  would  haue  either  willingly  haue  submitted 
themselues  thervnto,  or  haue  Craued  hberty  not  to  pceed  in  the  voyage 

And  now  Considering  y'  not  only  Robert  Guyar  &  John  white,  but  also 
the  rest  of  the  shipps  Company  at  the  first  vndertooke,  &  were  hired  to 
Come  first  hither,  hence  to  Canada,  fro'  thence  either  to  Portucall,  Biscay

The  answer  of  Robert  Guyar  and  John  White  to  y^  second  Complaint  and

Touching  Cap*  John  Haruey  CoiTiission  for  the  AdmiraUty  of  New  England, 
&  all  the  authority  that  by  vertue  therof  can  lawfully  bee  ChaUenged, 
ou9  vs,  wee  wilhngly  subniitt  o'selues  thervnto  no  way  Conceaueing  it  to 
be  here  in  force. 

Hee  Inferreth  yo'  order  proliibiting  o''  priuat  Conference  w""  any  of  y° 
shipps  Company,  as  though  hee  would,  but  uideed  nether  doth,  nor  Can 
iustly  accuse  vs  of  the  breach  therof 

His  pltence  of  sending  men  to  flouerdieu  hundred  to  fetch  him,  is  by  vs 
Coniectured  to  be  meerly  an  excuse  to  send  them  out  of  the  way,  that 
they  should  not  bee  present  to  testifie  the  truths  in  o'  behalfs,  y"  rather 
for  that  (as  it  is  not  vnknowen  vnto  them,  Robert  Guyar  had  formerly 
sent  men  to  Warrisquiacke  for  that  purpose,  the  Jealousy  of  such  an 
excuse  was  y"  cause  (it  is  Confessed)  that  Robert  Guyar  sent  word  hy  nY 
Dennis  his  boat  &  men  aboard  the  Southampton,  entreating  them  to 
speake  to  one  of  the  quarter  m''^  to  will  the  rest  of  the  Company  not  to 
absent  themselues,  because  the  Gouernor  would  send  for  them  the  next 
Day,  thinking  hmiselfe  to  haue  no  small  Cause  so  to  doe,  in  regard  Cap* 
Haruey  so  earnestly  pressed  for  Speedy  Sentence  to  be  pnounced,  alledging 
a  Crime  to  depriue  him  of  life,  Wherfore  wee  hope  this  board  will  not 
Censure  it  to  be  done,  either  as  hee  aUedgeth,  in  Contempt  of  ther  Lo'ps

I  and  my  frends  appointed,  haue  don  our  vtmost  endevors  for  searching 
out  the  truthe  in  answer  to  those  comands  which  the  Lords  of  his  Ma*''''

§heer§  to  bee  more  in  number,  and  provision  of  victualls  to  bee  more 
plentifull  then  wee  expected,  after  the  Massacre  and  so  great  a  mortalUty 
both  of  men  and  Catle,  but  theyr  is  great  want  of  Ainunicion,  and  diuerse 
solitary  plantations  too  slenderly  peopled,  to  avoyd  the  vigilancy  of  so 
subtile  and  nimble  an  enemie,  wherby,  and  by  the  stupid  securitie  of  our 
nation  it  is  to  bee  feared,  that  in  Soiner  time  when  the  corne  and  weeds 
are  growne  high,  heer  will  bee  much  mischief  done,  as  the  Attempts  of  the 
Ltdians  in  these  two  months  of  Marche  and  Aprill,  a  beadroll  wherof  sent 
to  theyr  Lop'  M*^  Pory  will  shewe  you,  doe  shrewdly  prognosticate.  Other- 
wise were  the  Indians  driven  of  from  infesting  our  people  and  Cattle,  as 
witli  no  great  forces  in  two  or  3  yeares,  they  might  bee,  then  the  Plantation 
w*''  good  government  would  vndoutedly  flourish,  in  February  at  our

Whereas  wee  have  taken  notice  That  some  of  the  Virginia  Compagnie 
have  presented  a  Petition  to  our  House  of  Commons,  and  doubting  it 
might  occasion  the  repetition,  and  renewing  of  those  Discords,  and

care,  and  the  Directions  of  our  Counsell  are  in  a  good  way  to  bee  composed, 
We  doe  signify  to  our  House  of  Commons,  That  wee  hold  it  very  unfitt 
for  the  Parliam'  to  trouble  themselves  with  those  Matters,  which  can 
produce  nothing,  but  a  further  increase  Schisme,  and  Faction,  and  disturbe

a  good  issue.  As  for  these  businesses  of  Virginia,  and  the  Barmudoes, 
ourself  have  taken  them  to  heart,  and  will  make  it  our  own  worke  to 
settle  the  quiet,  and  weUfare  of  those  Plantations,  and  will  bee  ready

Princely  love,  and  regard  to  our  House  of  Commons,  And  wee  earnestly

It  is  generally  knowen,  that  the  West  Indies,  are  at  this  day  almoast 
the  onely  Fountayne,  and  Spayne  as  it  were  the  Cesterne,  from  whence 
Silver  is  deriued  into  all  parts  of  Christendom. 

The  cause  of  the  greate  Importation  of  siluer  from  thence  into  this 
Realme,  hath  beene  for  that  Spayne  having  soe  greate  need  of  many 
English  Commodities  and  being  not  able  to  Counterballance  them  w"' 
their  owne,  they  haue  beene  forced  to  make  the  acompt  eeuen  w"'  Mony. 

But  since  this  Weede  of  Tobacho  hath  growen  into  request,  they  haue 
payde,  «s  (as  their  Prouerb  is)  for  all  our  Commodities  w"*  Their  Smoake: 
And  the  vayne  of  there  siluer  to  us  ward,  hath  beene  in  a  manner  dried 
upp,  to  the  Loss  of  a  Million  and  a  halfe  in  mony  in  theese  fifteene  yeares 
last  past. 

For  uppon  very  full  and  exact  examination,  it  hath  very  playnely  and 
undeniably  appeared,  that  what  by  vndersale  of  our  Natiue  Commodities 
to  make  ready  mony  §for§  el  their  Tobacho,  what  by  the  mony  itself e 
payde  unto  them  for  that  weede,  there  hath  beene  lest  §losse§  to  this 
Kingdom  of  one  hundred  Thousand  pound?  euery  yeare,  which  else 
would  haue  returned  in  mony  from  thence.  And  a  miserable  kynde  of 
Trade  hath  been  driuen  w*''  that  Nation,  our  Natiue  Commodities  Ijcing 
undersolde,  and  the  forreigne  ouerbought,  and  the  Treasure  of  mony 
transformed  into  a  Smoaking  weed. 

Your  humble  Conunons  therfore,  moast  instantly  craue  of  your  Ma'-'', 
that  the  Importation  of  Tobacho,  may  bee  prohibited  from  all  §other§ 
part?  other  then  save  your  Ma*«  §owne§  Dominions,  according  to  the 
Practize  in  like  Cases  in  all  other  Nations,  in  fauour  of  the  natiue  Com-

having  still  a  Watchfull  and  careful  eye  to  the  same  and  finding  the  courses 
taken  for  the  setling  thereof  had  not  taken  that  good  effecte  which  Wee 
intended  and  soe  much  desired  did  by  our  Coinission  lately  graunted  to 
ctaine  psons  of  quality  and  truste  cause  the  state  of  the  saide  Countrie  of 
Virginia  to  be  examyned  howe  yt  stood  aswell  in  pointe  of  livelyhood  as 
govermente  and  howe  and  in  What  manner  the  greate  Somes  of  money 
collected  and  intended  for  the  good  thereof  had  beene  expended  and  dis- 
bursed to  the  end  yf  good  Cause  were  Wee  might  by  our  royall  hande 
supplye  what  shoulde  be  founde  defective  And  whereas  our  Comissioners 
after  much  care  labour  and  paynes  expended  in  execucon  of  our  saide 
Comissions  did  ctifye  vs  that  our  subiectC  and  people  sent  to  inhabite 
there  and  to  plante  themselues  in  that  Coimtrye  \^'ere  most  of  them  by 
GodC  visitacon  sicknes  of  bodye  famyne  and  by  massacres  of  them  by  the 
native  Savages  of  the  lande  dead  and  deceased  and  those  that  Were  living  of 
them  lived  in  [miserable  and  lamentable  necessitye  and  Wante  but  the 
countrie  (for  any  thing  appered  to  the  saide  Coniissioners  to  the  contrary) 
they  conceived  to  be  fruitfull  and  healthfull  after  our  people  had  beene  some 
tyme  there  and  that  yf  Industrie  Were  vsed  yt  Woulde  pduce  many  staple 
and  good  comodities  though  as  yet  the  sixteene  yeres  govermente  nowe 
past  had  yeilded  fewe  or  none  and  that  this  neglecte  they  conceived  must 
fall  on  the  governors  and  Company  here  Whoe  had  power  to  directe  the 
plantacons  there  And  that  the  saide  plantacons  were  of  greate  ymportance 
and  Woulde  as  they  hoped  remayne  a  lasting  monumente  of  our  most 
gracious  and  happy  govermente  to  all  posterity  yf  the  same  were  psecuted 
to  those  endes  for  which  they  were  first  vndertaken  And  to  that  p9pose 
that  yf  our  first  graunte  herein  menconed  and  our  most  prudente  and 
princely  instruccons  given  in  the  beginyng  of  the  plantacon  for  the  direccon 
of  the  affaires  thereof  by  thirteene  Councellors  in  Virginia  and  as  manye 
here  all  nomynated  by  vs  had  beene  pusued  much  better  effectes  had  beene 
pduced  then  had  beene  by  the  alteracon  thereof  into  soe  populer  a 
course  and  amongst  soe  manye  handes  as  then  yt  was  which  caused  much 
contencon  and  confusion  Whereupon  Wee  entering  into  mature  and 
delibate  consideracon  of  the  }5misses  did  by  the  aduise  of  the  Lordes  of  our 
Privie  Councell  resolue  by  altering  the  Charters  and  Ires  Patentes  of  the 
saide  Company  as  to  the  pointes  of  govermente  Wherein  the  same  might 
be  founde  defective  to  settle  such  a  course  as  mighte  best  secure  the  safety  of 
our  people  there  and  cause  the  saide  plantacon  to  florishe  and  yet  with

may  be  many  and  aswell  in  respecte  of  the  nomber  as  of  the  nature  and 
coasequence  of  them  will  require  aduised  consideracon  and  delibacon

Martine,  dated  the  xix°  of  december.  1623.  Accompened  w*''  yours  of  the 
first  of  ffebruary.  to  the  same  effect,  which,  by  divers  reportes  and  rumors 
sjoice  his  arivall  by  him  raysed  he  hath  little  deserved  at  your  handes, 
Notw*''standinge  in  obedience  to  theire  and  your  Lorps  Lres,  We  haue  and 
are  redye  to  give  our  best  asistance  to  the  accomodation  of  his  busines, 
Wherof,  when  it  shalbe  finished  (wherin  we  will  vse  ou"^  best  expeditione) 
We  will  give  you  A  pticular  Accompte 

As  for  Order  Concerninge  the  Wyddow  Smaley,  wee  had  receaved  none,  till 
the  Receipt  of  your  last  Lres,  she  her  self  as  yett  is  nott  arived  in  Virginia, 
but  remaines  in  new  Englande,  nor  hath  appoynted  any  to  Solycite  her 
cause,  Butt  at  her  arivall  shee  shall  finde  all  lawfull  favor 

Yt  hath  pleased  God  this  yeere  to  give  us  a  greate  Victorie  over  Otiotan 
&  y"  Pomunkeys,  with  theire  Confederates,  by  a  hand  full,  beinge  in  all 
not  aboue  60  ffygh  tinge  men  (wherof  24  were  jonployde  only  in  the 
Cuttinge  downe  of  Corne)  Conducted  by  the  Gouernor,  in  w''''  was  shewed 
w'  the  Indyans  coulde  doe,  havinge  mantayned  fighte  two  days  together, 
and  much  therof  in  open  fielde.  The  younge  men  beinge  beaten  vpp  by  the 
elder,  Many  slayne,  and  as  much  Corne  cutt  downe,  as  by  the  Estimatione 
of  men  of  good  Judgment,  Was  Sufficyent  to  haue  Sustayned  fower  Thousand 
men  for  a  Twellv  mounthe,  who  were  so  discoraged,  that  they  gave  over 
fightinge  and  dismayedly,  stood  most  ruthfully  lookinge  one  while  theire 
Corne  was  Cutt  downe,  And  had  we  been  well  furnished  with  powder,

The  Gouernor  had  pceeded  further  to  Matepany  River,  wherby  he  had 
hassarded  the  Starvinge  of  all  those  nationes,  In  this  expeditione 
sixteene  of  the  English  were  hurte,  the  firste  and  seconde  daye  wherby  nyne 
of  the  best  shott  were  made  vnserviceable  for  that  tynie,  yett  never  A 
man  slayne,  nor  none  that  miscaried  of  those  hurtes  (since  when  the}'  haue 
nott  greatly  troubled  us,  nor  interupted  our  Labors,  The  Indyans 
were  never  knowne  to  shew  soe  greate  resolutione,  either  encoraged  by  the 
paucytie  of  ours,  or  theire  owne  greate  numbers,  There  beinge  of  the 
Pomuckeys  eight  hundred  bowmen,  besides  divers  nationes  that  cam  to 
asiste  them,  fightinge  nott  only  for  safegarde  of  theire  howses  and  such  a 
huge  quantetie  of  Corne,  but  for  theire  reputatione  w""  y*"  rest  of  the  Salvages: 
w'''  we  now  hope  they  haue  loste,  it  depending  much  vppon  the  success  of 
this  Actione,  The  Pomunckeys  havinge  made  greate  braggs,  of  what  they 
would  doe,  Amonge  the  Northerne  nationes:  of  whom  the  kinge  of  Potuxsone 
sent  an  Indyan  vnto  us  expressly  to  be  an  eye  witnes  of  the  evente 

Yf  our  store  of  powder  had  been  answerable  to  [o]u''  intentions  and  readines. 
We  had  gone  vppon  our  neighboringe  Indyans,  although  we  vnderstande, 
y'  they  haue  quitted  their  former  Plantacons  by  the  harshe  vissitts,  w"*" 
they  receaved  from  us  the  former  Sumer,  and  as  we  conceave  did  much 
relye  vppon  releiffe  from  the  Pomukeys,  who  therfore  planted  y"  greater 
quantitie.  Our  powder  is  now  so  farr  exhausted,  that  we  shall  not  be  able  to 
mantayne  our  Plantacons,  should  they  make  anny  atempt  vppon  us,  yf 
shortly  a  s[u]pplye  come  not  in,  Yt  beinge  now  the  seconde  of  decem- 
ber  and  noe  shipp  harde  of,  A  thinge  vnaccustomed.  And  for  many  reasones 
doth  putt  us  to  many  pplexities,  We  therfore  earnestly  desire  that  yf 
powder  be  not  allready  sente  accordinge  to  our  former  Lres,  That  order  bee 
taken  for  the  sendinge  thereof  w""  the  greatest  Celeritie,  that  possible

This  Sumer,  god  be  thanked,  the  Colony  hath  very  well  stoode  to  health: 
w"^  assureth  us  that  y''  mortalitie  of  former  j^eers,  is  to  be  imputed  to  other 
accydents,  and  not  to  ye  Clymate  And  am[o]nge  so  many  of  his  benefitts 
God  hath  sent  us  a  plentifull  harvest  of  Corne  and  the  industrious  are  well 
stored  w"'  other  provisiones,  soe  that  exceptinge  y"  number  of  men  the 
Colony  hath  worne  owt  the  Skarrs  of  the  massacre,  and  yf  in  any  thinge  it 
come  shorte  in  many  thing?  it  exceeds  the  former  Condicone

The  Answer  of  S'  George  Yeardly  Knight  Defendant  to  the  Demands  of 
Capt.  John  Marti[n]  Esquire  Complaynant  whereby  he  requireth  recom- 
pence  of  wrongs  donn  him. 

To  the  first,  the  said  defendant  saith  that  he  never  knew  that  VP  Whittakers 
had  at  any  time  any  Corne  of  the  said  Complaynant^.^  but  saith  that  IVP 
Whittakers  intestate  he  the  said  Defendant  being  then  Deputy  Governo'' 
of  Virginia  required  one  Thomas  Hobson,  who  belonged  to  M"'  Whittakers 
and  was  as  his  Sonne  and  Child  kept  by  him  in  his  life  time,  to  take  an 
Inventorie  of  all  such  goodC  and  provisions  as  were  then  to  be  found  in 
the  said  M'  Wliittakers  house  and  them  to  take  into  his  safe  custodie  that 
if  afterwards  there  did  appeare  any  to  whom  the  goodC  might  more  rightly 

'  A  pencilled  note  in  the  margin  reads:  "Wanting.     N.B.     See   [S.P.]    Dom.    Car.    I   Vol.    11

belong  he  should  be  accomptable  for  thein.  and  the  said  Defendant  saith 
there  was  as  farr  as  he  remenibreth  found  in  the  said  house  of  Corne  tenn 
barreU^  of  Eares  which  he  verily  beleeveth  was  the  said  M'  Whittakers 
owne  Corne  w^h  Corne  was  afterwards  disposed  of  and  spent  by  the  said 
The:  Hobson  in  the  feeding  of  himself,  Jarrett  HoUock  John  Flood  and 
one  Ruben  all  of  them  servant?  to  the  said  M'  Wliittakers. 

And  saith  further  that  after  the  arivall  of  S'  Samuell  Argall  who  succeeded 
the  said  Defendant  in  the  Goverment  of  Virginia  there  came  into  this 
Colony  a  sister  of  M"'  Whittakers  who  made  enquiry  after  the  good?  of 
her  deceased  brother  but  found  tliat  he  left  little  of  vallew  behind  him. 
at  that  time  also  was  the  said  Complaynant  here  in  this  Contrie  who  no 
doubt  if  he  had  then  complayned  to  S'  Samuell  Argall  and  could  haue 
made  proof  that  the  said  Corne  had  any  waise  belonged  vnto  him  he  might 
then  haue  recou9ed  the  same,  for  the  Corne  was  at  that  time  very  little 
thereof  spent,  if  he  did  not  then  complaine  or  had  nott  iustice  don  him 
therein  the  said  Defendant  saith  itt  was  no  fault  of  his. 

To  the  second  the  said  Defendant  saith  that  he  doth  remember  one  Pope 
whoe  served  in  his  Shipp  as  Cooke  enterteyne*^  for  that  pourpose  by  James 
Brett  M'  of  his  said  Shipp  and  went  also  for  England  as  he  remenibreth 
therin  but  whether  the  said  Pope  were  servant  to  the  Complaynant  or 
was  runn  away  from  him  the  said  defend'  knoweth  nott.  and  doth  further 
protest  and  wilbe  redy  to  be  Sworne  that  the  said  Complayna[nt]  never 
at  any  time  to  his  rememberance  spacke  to  the  said  Defendant  of  or 
concerning  the  said  Pope  nor  that  ever  he  so  much  as  heard  say  that  the 
said  Pope  was  runn  away  from  the  said  Complaynant. 

To  tlie  Third  the  Defendant  saith  that  with  his  knowledg  or  by  any 
Warrant  or  allowance  of  his  there  were  never  any  kine  or  Calues  taken 
from  the  said  Complaynant  to  the  vse  of  M'  Bargraue  as  he  suggesteth 
and  therefor  the  said  Defend'  deemeth  the  said  Complaynant  to  be  much 
mistaken  in  demanding  allowance  for  any  such  kine  or  Calues  from  him 
the  said  Defendant. 

To  the  fourth  the  said  Defendant  saith  that  he  was  never  acquainted  that 
the  Complaynant  had  hired  any  of  Capt  stallinges  men  neither  did  he  ever 
heare  say  that  the  said  Complaynant  had  hired  any  one  or  more  of  them

said  Defendant  and  did  intreat  for  help  to  gett  of  the  said  Shipp  where- 
vppon  the  said  Dcfendan'  saith  he  lent  the  said  Stallinge  the  long  Boat 
of  the  Diana  with  twelue  of  her  best  men  to  help  of  the  said  Shipp.  but 
before  they  could  gett  her  afloat  they  were  forced  to  vnlade  much  of  her 
provisions  and  good^  and  by  the  direccion  of  the  said  Stallinge  to  carry 
them  on  Shoar  vppon  the  South  side  of  the  River  and  afterwards  with 
great  labo'  brought  the  said  Shipp  into  Southampton  River  where  the 
said  Stallinge  very  negligently  left  her  w*h  only  a  boy  to  poump  out  the 
watter.  the  said  Shipp  being  extream  leaky  by  reason  of  the  great  hurt 
shee  tooke  in  rohinge  one  ground  at  Bowiers  Bay  and  he  the  said  Stallinge

vnderstanding  the  misaccident  of  the  said  Stallinges  Death  and  howe  also 
that  the  said  Shipp  was  left  by  him  in  doubt  of  perishing  and  that  divers 
of  the  goods  and  p''ovisions  belonginge  to  her  were  left  one  shore  by  the 
said  Stallinge  in  hazard  of  the  Indians  whereby  S""  Ferdinando  Gorge

Defendant  saith  he  gaue  notice  by  letters  vnto  the  said  S""  Ferdinando 
intreatinge  hime  to  appoint  and  send  over  some  one  whoe  might  receue 
them  to  his  vse  w"h  afterward?  the  said  S'  Ferdinando  did  and  gaue  great

give  him  any  notice  of  any  such  agreement,  nor  did  then  or  after  require 
of  him  that  they  might  fulfill  any  Coveiint  or  agreement  made,  soe  that 
he  verylie  beleeveth  that  there  was  not  any  Covennt  made  at  all  betwene 
the  said  Complaynant  and  the  said  Shipps  Company.  And  further  saith

ernor having  occacon  for  the  publique  servic'  to  employ  Ensigne  Savage 
as  an  Interpreto'  he  sent  for  him  to  the  Complaynant  at  wiiose  Plantacon 
he  then  lived  and  saith  that  after  the  said  Ensignes  returne.  the  like 
occacon  required  the  sendinge  of  him  againe  butt  saith  that  ^  was  nott 
acquainted  by  the  said  Complaynnt  that  the  said  Ensigne  was  his  hired 
servant  nether  did  the  said  Complaynant  require  the  said  Ensigne  to  be 
sent  home  againe.  nor  did  the  said  Defend*  knowe  that  the  said  Com- 
playnant had  any  occacon  to  employ  the  said  Ensigne  to  go  abroad  in 
his  Shallopp.  and  saith  further  that  he  did  not  vnderstand  that  the  said 
Ensigne  was  servant  to  the  said  Complaynant  or  any  man  else  but  as  a 
publicjue  Interpreto^  yet  saith  that  if  the  said  Complaynant  had  desired 
to  haue  made  vse  of  the  said  Ensigne  and  had  acquainted  him  the  said 
Defend'  therew*h  he  beleeueth  he  should  have  beene  redy  to  haue  showed 
him  curtisie  therein  for  at  that  time  and  afterward?  the  said  Defendant 
did  vnto  the  said  Complaynant  many  speciall  fauo"  w'^h.  as  he  thinketh 
the  said  Complaynant  wilbe  redye  to  acknowledg  one  among  the  rest 
being  the  lending  of  him  Corne  when  both  he  and  his  people  relied  very 
great  necessitie.  And  saith  [3]  further  that  he  knoweth  not  nor  doth 
beleeue  that  the  said  Comjjlaynant  had  at  that  time  whilest  the  said 
Ensigne  was  employed  by  the  said  Defendt  for  the  publique  servic'  of  the 
Collony  any  intent  to  send  forth  his  Shalloi:)?  (nie  tradinge  for  that  his 
Croi)p  must  haue  spoiled  one  the  ground  in  the  absente  of  his  people. 

To  tlic  si.xth  the  Defendent  saith  that  the  said  Complayant  was  sent  for 
to  James  Cittie  by  the  Generall  Assemblie  who  writt  him  a  very  curteous 
letter  to  that  effec*  the  Copie  whereof  the  said  defendt  hath  to  shew  theire 
desier  to  comune  w'h  hhn  as  by  the  iornall  of  the  generall  Assemblie 
will  app(?re  was  for  that  he  sent  from  his  plantacion  two  Bvu-gesses  to  sitt 
in  the  Assembly  and  to  haue  theire  \()ices  there  in  the  makeinge  of  lawes 
and  orders  for  the  good  and  peaceably  gouerning  of  the  Collony  vnto  Wh 
lawes  they  the  said  Burgesses  would  nott  assure  the  said  Assembly  that 
the  said  Defendt  or  any  of  the  people  that  lived  vnder  his  Comai^d  would 
be  obedient  vnto,  but  that  he  the  said  Complainant  wold  notwistanding

any  lawes  that  should  be  made  there,  govern  and  Comand  by  the  autlioritie 
of  his  private  Pattent  and  strictly  stand  vppon  the  privileges  thereof, 
vnder  the  protecion  of  w'=h  said  Pattent  it  was  well  known  to  the  Assemblie 
that  there  lived  at  his  plantacion  diu9s  bankroutC  and  indebted  psons 
w*h  others  of  evill  fame  w^'h  said  psons  the  said  Ccniiplaynant  had  and 
hath  diu9s  times  protected  against  the  authoritie  of  the  publique  officers 
of  this  CoUony  and  would  nott  suffer  them  to  be  arrested  for  theire  debt^ 
but  hath  Comanded  the  sayd  publique  officers  to  depte  his  teritorie, 
threatninge  them  otherwise  to  lay  them  Neck  and  heeles.  wherof  the 
said  publique  officers  haue  complayned  to  the  said  Defend'  as  he  will 
be  Sworn  and  could  haue  otherwise  more  strongly  prooved  if  the  said 
ofiicers  were  now  allive.  by  Wh  the  said  Complaynant  opposcion  and 
resistance,  the  Cape  Marchant  of  the  ould  Magazine  hath  beene  forced 
to  stay  for  the  dept^  of  the  said  Magazine,  as  himself  beinge  now  here  is 
able  to  wittnes.  Another  reson  of  the  Generall  Assemblies  sendinge  for 
the  said  Complaynants  to  Comune  w'h  him  might  be  and  was  concerninge 
an  outrage  done  by  some  of  the  said  ComplaynantC  people  to  Certaine 
Indians  in  the  Bay  w*h  whom  wee  were  in  league  and  peace,  in  takeing 
away  by  violenc'  from  them  a  certain  quantitie  of  Corne  at  w^h  act  it 
semed  to  the  assemblie  the  said  Complaynant^  conive,'  and  Complaint 
bing^  thereof  made  to  the  said  Defend*  by  Opachankan,  whoe  also  was 
C'omplajmed  vnto  by  the  Kinge  one  the  Eastren  shore  to  whom  those 
people  and  the  foresaid  corn  belonged,  that  sattisfacon  might  be  made 
the  said  Assemblie  thinking  the  same  but  reson  resolued  to  moue  the 
said  Complaynant  therein. 

To  the  seventh  the  Defend'  saith  that  vppon  the  Day  of  the  massacre  the 
said  Defend'  going  vpp  in  his  shipp  toward?  fiourdien  hundred  and  the  tid 
takeinge  him  short  about  Capt  Sand'^s  his  plantacon  he  manned  his  Shipps 
boatt  and  went  one  shore  to  search  if  anny  of  the  people  might  haue  lyen 
wounded  whome  he  might  haue  saved  and  recovered,  but  serchinge  the 
ground  and  findinge  none  it  groweing  toward?  night  he  retired  to  his  Shipp 
purposeing  to  send  downe  his  boat?  the  next  day  to  haue  saued  the  Corne

benn  found  of  worth  to  haue  beene  brought  thenc'  the  necessitie  and  danger 
of  the  Defend'  one  plantacon  nott  pmitinge  at  that  time  his  longer  stay

there,  but  the  next  day  he  had  certaine  newes  that  the  houses  and  all 
things  else  therem  were  burnt,  he  also  saith  that  he  doth  nott  know  of 
any  thmge  that  was  brought  thenc'  saue  some  poulterie  from  the  roust  at 
one  Taylors  howse  a  dweller  there,  together  w%  a  Sow  w'^h  he  the  said

things  as  it  should  seeme  by  there  strowinge  of  old  Chest?  and  barrelK 
about  the  feild  but  weather  there  were  at  the  sayd  Capt  Saund's  Plantacon 
any  good?  at  all  belonging  to  the  said  Complaynant  the  said  Defend'  saith 
he  knoweth  nott  nor  did  he  see  or  pceue  that  anything  was  brought  thence 
by  any  of  his  people  saue  one  yong  Calf  w'^h  dyed  in  the  Shipp  and  [4]  Was 
throwne  ourbord  before  he  got  vpp  to  Flourdieu  Hundred  And  farther 
saith  that  if  the  said  Complaynant  can  p""oue  that  any  thing  was  by  him  the 
said  Defend'  or  by  any  other  w'h  his  allowace  brought  thence  he  wilbe 
ready  to  make  |51sent  sattifaccon  for  the  same  to  the  right  owners  thereof. 
Moreover  the  said  Defend'  saith  that  he  hath  heard  that  non  of  the  good? 
of  the  said  Complaynant  were  at  the  Plantacon  of  the  said  Capt  Sand's 
butt  were  lefte  by  him  the  said  Complaynant  at  his  depture  for  England  in 
his  owne  dwellinge  houses  w''h  were  about  A  mielle  distant  from  the  said 
Plantacon  And  where  the  said  Defend*  saith  that  neither  he  nor  any  of  his 
people  ever  came  at  that  time  or  since  the  Massacre  and  therefor  the  said 
Complayant  shall  doe  him  wrong  if  he  accuse  him  of  bringeng  any  thing

To  the  [ei'gh]t  the  DQlfcndant  saith  t]-  hat  vntill  this  time  he  never  heard  of

CO.  1,  Vol.  Ill,  No.  40 
Dociuncnt  in  Public  Record  Office,  London 
List  of  Records  No.  758 

May  it  please  your  Lo"' 

When  last  wee  attended  this  Honourable  Bourd,  yo'  Lo'^  required  ^^^'o  g'overm' i1l*Maf 

things  at  our  hands,  to  lie  presented  this  day  in  writing  to  yo''  Lo''^  162.5' 

The  first,  our  opinion  touching  the  best  forme  of  Gouernement,  to 
be  here  established  for  y"  affaires  of  Virginia. 

The  second,  an  offer  to  be  made  for  such  a  Contract  touching 
Tobacco  w**"  his  Ma"'"  as  might  both  vphold  his  former  Revenue, 
and  not  be  grievous  to  the  Plantations. 

Concerning  the  former  of  w"*"  proposicons,  wee  humbly  crane  leaue  thus 
much  to  deliver  w^'out  offence,  that  it  came  alltogether  vnexpected  to  vs: 
who  brought  w""  vs  a  strong  &  confirmed  resolucon,  not  to  entermedle 
any  more  in  the  busines  of  Virginia,  so  foyled  &  wronged  by  the  partie 
opposite,  &  now  reduced  to  extreame  termes  allmost  past  recovery  and 
wherein  all  our  former  labours,  cares,  &  expences,  had  receaved  by  the 
practise  &  procurement  of  these  men,  the  vndeserved  reward  of  rebuke 
&  disgrace. 

Notw'^'standinge  in  due  obedience  vnto  yo"^  Lo^'  Coiiiaund,  whom  wee 
haue  allwayes  found  iust  &  hono'''^  (and  if  happily  some  good  may  redound 
thereby  to  that  now  distressed  and  languishing  Plantation,  w''''  hath  bin 
heretofore  so  deare  vnto  vs,  and  w"'^  gaue  so  great  hope  of  honfjur  to  this 
Kingdome,  &  might  haue  bin  in  these  tymes  of  warrly  preparations,  of 
so  great  vse  &  service  to  his  Ma*'",  if  it  had  bin  so  cherished  &  strengthened 
by  these  men,  as  when  they  gayned  the  governem*,  they  pretended  & 
promised,  wee  wished  and  desired):  Wee  here  present  in  all  humblenes 
our  deliberate  opinion  touching  y''  forme  of  Governem'  now  fittest  to  be 
established,  for  y""  restoring  &  reviving  of  that  Plantation,  if  it  be  possible 
yet  to  be  recovered.     Wherein  wee  thinke  it  requisite,  that  yo"'  Lo^'  in 


In  pencil. 


520  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

the  first  place  be  truly  informed,  of  y'"  state  of  that  Colony,  what  l^efore 
it  was,  and  what  now  it  is,  according  vnto  y"-'  best  advertisements  from 
thence  received. 

The  Plantation  now  in  Virginia,  began  about  y''  yeare  1606  &  continued 
about  Twelue  yeares  vnder  the  Governem'  of  y"  selfe  same  handes,  w^hcre- 
into  it  was  first  intrusted  by  the  late  Kings  INIa"",  the  most  Roj'all  founder 
of  this  Noble  worke. 

The  perticular  carriages  of  this  first  Governem',  are  too  long,  &  would 
bee  too  displeasing  to  yo'  Lo^p"  eares.  But  in  Generall  such  it  was,  as 
the  now  Earle  of  Midd.  then  Lo:  high  Treasuror  (being  an  ancient 
Adventurer  &  Councellor  for  Virginia)  informed  yo'  Lof",  sitting  in  Counsell 
the  5""  of  March  1C22  when  he  told  Aldfan  Johnson,  That  in  former  yeares, 
when  he  y"  said  Alderman  was  Deijutie,  and  the  busines  was  in  other 
handes,  it  was  carried  leaudly,  so  that  if  they  should  be  called  to  an 
accompt  for  it,  their  Estates  would  not  answere  it. 

What  his  Lo""  delivered  as  his  owne  Censure,  was  truly  the  opinion  of  y" 
whole  Company  of  Adventurers  here  in  England.  And  w""  them  doth  y" 
Colonie  concur [?-e],  having  the  last  yeare  by  theire  Viceadmirall  sent  a 
writing  signed  by  the  handC  of  the  Generall  Assembly,  &  directed  to  his 
Ma*'",  w^herein  having  declared,  the  manner  of  those  Twelue  yeares 
Governem*,  they  conclude  w""  these  words,  full  of  passionat[e]  griefe; 
And  rather  then  to  be  reduced  to  liue  vnder  the  like  Governement,  wee 
desire  his  Ma*'"  that  Comissioners  may  be  sent  ouer  with  authoritie  to 
liang  [2]  vs. 

Of  this  (luallitie  was  the  first  Governem*.  And  answerable  to  the  Forme, 
were  the  Effects,  as  y""  Generall  Assemblie  having  by  oath  examined  the 
perticulers,  sett  downe  in  their  Declaration  directed  to  his  late  Ma''^. 

1.  For  People  then  alive  about  y"  nomber  of  400. 

2.  Very  many  of  them  in  want  of  Corne,  vtterly  dt^stitute  of  Cattle, 
Swine,  Poultry,  and  other  provisions  to  nourish  them. 

3.  As  for  Fortification  agaynst  a  forraigne  enimy,  there  was  none  at  all, 
oiiely  foure  ]ieeces  mounted,  but  altogether  vnservireal)le. 


APRIL  {?),  1625  521 

4.  There  was  onely  eight  Plantacons,  all  w"''  were  but  poorely  lioused, 
and  as  ill  fortified  agaynst  the  Sauages. 

5.  Onely  one  old  Friggott  belonging  to  y"  Sumer  Ilandes,  one  Shallop,  one 
Shippboate,  and  two  small  boats  belonging  to  private  men. 

6.  Three  Ministers  in  orders,  &  Two  w'^out 

7.  No  Comoditie  on  foote  saue  Tobacco. 

8.  The  Indians  in  doubtfuU  Termes. 

This  as  they  report  was  the  true  estate  of  y"  Plantacons  at  y°  Twelue 
yeares  end.  To  w'=''  bemg  added  the  other  condicon  of  the  Colonic,  w'^'' 
in  other  wri tinges  they  expresse; 

1.  That  they  rather  hved  or  rather  suffred  vnder  Martiall  Lawe: 

2.  Vnder  a  most  extorting  Governour  there,  whome  by  24  bundles  of 
deposicons  they  haue  accused  of  strange  depredacons: 

3.  Vnder  most  oppressiue  orders  hence,  to  y''  breach  of  all  faith  &  honesty: 

4.  W'out  comfort  of  Wiues  or  servants: 

5.  W*out  assurance  of  their  Estates: 

6.  There  being  no  Dividents  of  land  laid  out: 

7.  W'^'out  assurance  of  their  Lib9ties,  being  violently  deteyned  as  serv**^ 
beyond  their  Covehnted  tymes: 

Wee  may  truly  aflfirme,  that  y''  intencons  of  y"  people  then  in  Virginia, 
were  no  wayes  to  settle  there  as  a  Colonie,  but  to  gett  a  little  wealth  by 
Tobacco,  then  in  price,  and  so  to  returne  for  England. 

As  for  y°  Adventurers  here,  the  greatest  part  were  long  before  beaten  out 
as  from  an  hopeless  Action.  In  w"''  reguard  there  was  fifteene  thousand 
pounds  deteyned  of  mens  subscripconC,  w''^  by  no  meanes  they  could  bee 
procured  to  pay  in;  sundry  of  them  alleaging  in  their  answeres  in  Chauncery 
vpon  their  oathes,  the  misimployment  of  y"  monyes,  &  ill  keeping  of  the 
Accounts.  Those  few  that  followed  the  busines,  vpon  some  hope  to 
reforme  it,  were  (by  the  Governours  here,  for  their  owne  perticuler  ends  as 
is  conceaved,  for  to  their  private  benefitt  it  was  only  sutable,)  directed  to 
bestowe  their  monyes  in  Adventuringe  by  way  of  Magazine,  vpon  two 
Comodities  onely,  Tobacco  &  Sassafras,  [3]  matters  of  present  proffitt,  but 
no  wayes  fitt  foundacons  of  a  future  State.  Soe  that  of  a  mcrchantlike 
Trade  there  was  some  probabiUitie,  at  least  for  a  while:  but  of  a  Plantation 


522  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

there  was  none  at  all,  neither  in  the  courses,  nor  in  y"  intencons,  either  of 
the  Adventurers  here,  or  of  the  Colonie  there. 

In  this  Estate  &  condiOon  was  the  Action  lefte  by  the  First,  to  y"  Second 
Governm*  w'^''  began  in  y"  yeare  •  1619  ■  by  the  choice  of  S'  Edwin  Sandis 
for  Treasurer.  To  whome  y""  yeare  followinge  succeeded  y^  Earle  of 
Southampton. 

1.  Vnder  whose  Governem*^  by  Gods  blessing,  the  Plantation,  soe  pros- 
pered, as  by  the  end  of  y"  yeare  •  1621  •  the  nomber  of  people  was  encreased 
there,  to  be  about  Two  thousand. 

2.  The  number  of  Neat  Cattle,  besides  Goates  &  Swyne,  Eight  hundred. 

3.  The  number  of  Housinge  was  proporconably  encreased,  and  the  manner

4.  The  number  of  Boates  was  Ten  tymes  multiplyed:  And  w'^h  was  much 
more,  there  were  Fower  Shippes  belonging  to  the  Colonie. 

5.  There  were  sent  more  then  eight  able  Ministers. 

6.  With  great  care  &  cost  there  were  procured  men  skilfuU  in  Sawing- 
Milles  from  Hambrough. 

7.  Vigneroones  from  Languedoch:  In  divers  places  of  y"  Colonie,  Vine- 
yards begunne,  some  of  them  conteyninge  Ten  thousand  plantC: 

8.  Store  of  Silkeworme-seed  sent: 

9.  And  the  Iron-workes  brought  after  Five  thousand  pounds  expences  to 
that  assured  perfection,  as  w'hin  Three  moneths  they  promised  to  send 
home  great  Quantities. 

10.  Many  new  Plantations  were  made: 

11.  All  men  had  sufficiency  of  Corne: 

12.  §And  many§  Great  plenty  of  Cattle,  Swyne  &  Poultrie,  &  other  good 
provisions. 

13.  The  mortallitie  w'''  had  raigned  the  two  first  j'eares,  (w""''  at  that  tyme 
was  generall  over  all  America)  was  at  last  ceased. 

14.  Soe  that  by  this  sodayne  &  vnexpected  advancem'  of  the  Plantation

16.  Provisions  being  made  for  y^  mayntennce  of  Officers,  that  they  should 
not  need  to  prey  vpon  y*"  people:  And  y^  like  done  for  y*^  Ministers: 

17.  The  libertie  of  a  Generall  Assembly  being  graunted  them,  whereby  they 
find  out,  &  execute  those  thinges,  as  might  best  tend  to  their  good: 

18.  The  estates  of  Land  by  iust  Dividents  being  surely  conveyed: 

19.  A  Free  Trade  from  hence  for  all  sorts  of  people  being  permitted,  where- 
by they  were  eeven  to  superfluity  furnished  w4i  all  necessaries: 

[4]  The  Colony  grewe  into  an  opinion,  that  they  were  the  happiest  people 
in  y*"  world:  W'^''  meeting  here  at  home  w*  y*"  experience  of  most  Noble 
demeanC  on  y''  Companies  part,  agaynst  Wh  Envy  itselfe  could  not  finde 
any  shadowe  of  Calumny  or  offence:  the  reputaeon  of  this  Action  grew  to 
such  an  height,  as  not  only  the  old  Adventurers  renewed  their  zeale  of  their 
first  Loves,  but  great  numbers  of  new  came  dayly  in  w'h  assurance  to 
expend  large  soines  in  the  busines.  And  for  y"  Plant's  to  goe  in  person, 
not  only  here  at  home  Thousands  of  choise  people  off  red  themselues: 
but  out  of  Ireland  went  divers  Shipp,  &  more  were  followinge: 

Three  hundred  Families  French  &  Dutch  in  the  yeare  ■  1621  •  made  request 
to  the  State,  that  they  might  plant  in  Virginia:  whither  not  long  before, 
Condempned  persons  had  refused  to  goe  w"'  pardon  of  their  Lives. 

The  great  amendment  in  this  and  in  all  other  parts  of  this  Action,  made  the 
Earle  of  Middlesex  say  at  yo'  bono'''''  Board,  That  in  these  latter  tymes  the 
Plantation  by  the  good  carriage  had  thriuen  and  prosppered  beyond 
belief e,  and  almost  miraculouslie. 

This  wee  cannot  but  esteeme  an  hono'''''  testimony  proceeding  from  our 
most  heavy  Enemy,  who  had  himselfe  layde  n  o'  way  soe  many  great 
Rubbs  &  Difficulties,  as  hee  might  well  say,  It  was  by  miracle  wee  ouer 
them.

524  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

And  the  third  yeare,  enforcinge  vs  to  bring  all  in,  onely  to  the  enricheni' 
of  his  private  freinds.  But  besides  these,  wee  were  continually  stru'i;iinge 
w'h  a  most  malicious  faction  w"'in  our  owne  Body  here,  besides  that 
vniversall  sickenes  abroad  in  the  Colony  menconed  before:  Yet  through  all 
these  Difficulties  did  wee  wrestle  by  Gods  l^lessing,  w"'  the  expence  of  lesse 
then  fower  &  twenty  thousand  poundes  of  the  Publiq'  Stock.  For  howso- 
ever yo''  Lo""'  haue  beene  enformed,  the  very  truth  w'h  wee  shall  allwayes 
make  good,  is,  that  there  was  not  receaved  from  the  Lottaries  in  the  tjane 
of  this  latter  Governem*,  any  more  then  Twenty  one  thousand  Seaven 
hundred  Sixty  six  poundes,  Nyne  shillings  Two  pence. 

By  the  exponce  of  wii  soine,  together  w'h  about  Three  thousand  pounds 
receaued  from  the  Collections,  wee  brought  the  Colony  to  those  Termes 
wee  haue  related.  And  if  in  y°  Declaration  sent  to  his  Ma''°  the  last  yeare, 
the  Colony  haue  made  a  right  &  perfect  Calculacon,  wee  affirme  vnto  yo' 
Lo""  that  in  y"  first  Three  yeares  of  this  latter  Governement,  the  Company 
sent  as  many  Shipps  in  Nomber,  but  of  greater  burthen ;  As  many  people  in 
nomber,  but  much  better  provided,  as  were  sent  in  the  first  Twelue  j^eares. 
Yet  had  the  latter  Governem*  vnder  Twenty  fower  Thousand  poundes,  and 
S''  Thomas  Smith  receaved  above  Three  score  and  fifteene  thousand  poundes 
of  publiq'  Stock.  Soe  that  w^ee  [5]  may  truly  affirme,  through  Gods  blessing, 
w"'  a  Third  i)art  of  the  mony,  and  in  a  fourth  part  of  y'^  tyme,  wee  brought 
the  Plantation  to  thri[co}  §  foure  tymes  §  the  nomber  of  Men  that  S"" 
Thomas  Smith  lefte  it  in,  and  in  all  other  parts  incomparabl}^  better. 

The  Plantacon  being  grownc  to  this  height  by  the  end  of  y""  yeare  1G21  it 
pleased  God  in  his  secrett  iudgement  to  giue  leaue  to  y''  enemies  thereof,  by 
many  powerful!  &  most  wicked  meanes,  to  bring  it  downe  agayne  to 
y'-  ground. 

The  first  Blowe  was  a  most  bloudy  Massacre,  when  by  the  Treacherous 
cruelty  of  the  Savadges,  about  400  of  o"'  People  were  slayne;  vpon  the  22**^ 
of  March  1621.  The  terror  whereof  w"'  the  losse  of  much  Cattle  and  other 
Substance,  and  a  sodayne  alteracon  of  the  State  of  all  thinges,  so  dismaide 
the  whole  Colony,  as  they  allmost  gaue  themselucs  for  gone.  But  then 
appeared  both  the  love  of  the  Company  to  the  Plantation,  &  their  great 
abilitie  to  goe  through  therewith:  when  in  supply  of  this  Losse,  and  for  y'' 
encouragem'  of  the  C'olony,  they  did  send  that  yeare  to  Virginia  16  Ships 


APEIL  (?),  1625  525 

&  800  people,  and  that  altogether  at  y"  charges  of  private  Adventurers. 
For  the  publiq'  Stock  bemg  vtterly  exhaust  the  yeare  before,  was  not 
able  to  contribute  500".  toward  all  this  charge. 

But  this  cruell  Tragedy  of  the  Massacre,  was  seconded  by  Two  other  sharpe 
Calamities  in  y"  very  neck  one  of  another: 

First  Scarcitie  in  the  Colony  by  being  putt  off  from  their  Grounds  prepared, 
together  w'''  the  losse  of  their  season  &  much  seed;  besides  that,  through 
the  troublcsomnes  of  those  tymes,  they  could  not  freely  unploy  themselues 
in  plantinge  thereof,  no  not  in  those  their  scanted  grounds,  many  Plantacons 
being  drawne  into  few  places  for  their  better  defence.  W'^''  pesteringe  of 
themselues,  did  likewise  breed  Contagious  sickenesse;  w'^''  being  encreased 
by  the  Infection  brought  in  by  some  shipps,  there  dyed  that  yeare  of 
Mortallitie  neere  vpon  600  more:  and  the  Colony  passed  much  hardnesse 
in  their  victuall,  by  reason  of  the  miscarriage  of  one  of  their  Shippes,  w''^ 
the  Company  sett  forth  w""  aboue  500"  worth  of  Meale  and  other  provisions: 
But  the  Shipp  being  blowne  vp  w*^*"  Powder  at  the  Sumer  Islandes,  the 
Provisions  were  lost,  &  neuer  came  to  Virginia 

Notwithstandinge  these  thinges  were  most  grievous  to  the  Company  here; 
yett  were  they  no  wayes  of  Discouragement,  but  rather  seemed  to  add  heat 
to  their  former  zeale:  so  as  by  the  begining  of  the  yeare  1623  there  appeared 
in  readines  §  &  preparation  §  to  goe  to  Virginia,  double  that  nomber  of 
people,  &  Adventurers,  that  any  former  yeare  had  carried.  Vv^hen  on  a 
sodayne  the  Plantation  it  selfe  was  by  Captaine  Butler  in  a  certayne 
writinge  Intituled,  The  vnmaskinge  of  Virginia,  soe  fowly  disgraced,  and 
the  present  miseries  thereof  so  farr  amplified  aboue  Truth,  and  the  future 
hopes  thereof  so  belowe  all  good  meaninge  drided  &  villified  by  divers  ill 
willers  of  the  Action,  especially  some  discontented  members  of  y"  Company, 
as  the  greatest  part  of  the  intended  Supplies  for  New  Plantations,  gave  over, 
as  some  of  themselues  will  testify  to  yo''  Lo''". 

[6]  Yet  notw^'^standinge,  the  vnited  Body  of  the  Company,  did  even  that 
yeare  1623  send  out  Eleaven  shipps,  stored  w""  supplies  of  victuall  & 
provisions:  although  by  many  cruell  Encounters  of  the  0])posites,  they 
were  sore  hindred  and  delected,  directly  w"'  Intention  to  make  them  abandon 
y""  busines.    But  the  welfare  of  the  Plantacon,  and  the  mayntennce  of  their 


526  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

owne  honour  &  creditc,  did  prevaile  so  w*^  the  Company,  that  though  w"" 
the  certainty  of  their  owne  extreame  losse,  they  passed  in  the  aboundance 
of  Supply,  not  only  the  necessities  of  the  Colony,  but  even  the  vnreasonable 
demands  of  their  Opposites:  havinge  in  fower  dayes  space  that  was  given 
them  after  the  notice  of  the  Colonies  want,  procured  the  vnderwriting  of 
Fower  thousand  pounds  Adventure:  w"^  the  Hono''''"  Board  of  the  privy 
Counsell  was  pleased  w""  much  Noble  favour  highly  to  approve. 

As  for  the  people  that  went  that  yeare  in  those  Eleaven  ships,  the  nomber 
was  not  aboue  260:  and  those  procured  not  w^'out  difficulty,  so  much  had 
the  disgrace  of  the  Plantation  spread  amongst  y*  Coinon  sort  of  people: 

Neither  could  it  be  prevented  by  the  Companie,  although  they  vsed  all 
possible  dilligence:  soUiciting  the  Comission"^  then  appointed  by  his  Ma*'* 
by  a  publiq'  Examinacon  of  Captayne  Butlers  reporte,  to  cleare  the  truth. 
But  they  would  by  no  meanes  bee  drawne  therevnto. 

As  for  the  Companie  it  selfe,  their  proceedings  &  demeano^'  were  soe 
opprobriously  calumniated:  as  deprived  them  both  of  abillitie  &  credite 
to  doe  any  good  herein:  but  w'^  much  sorrowe  to  behold  how  sencibly  and 
dangerously  the  good  opinion  of  this  Action  decayed;  so  that  divers 
Preachers  of  note  in  the  Cittie  that  had  begunne  in  this  latter  Governem' 
to  pray  continually  for  Virginia,  lef te  quite  the  remembrance  of  it ;  finding 
the  Action  to  growe  either  odious  or  contemptible  in  mens  minds:  w'"''  yet 
but  a  little  before  was  of  that  esteeme,  as  divers  on  their  death  beds  gaue 
great  Legacies  to  the  furtherance  thereof:  and  even  from  the  East  Indies 
by  way  of  Contriburon,  hath  bin  sent  by  the  Factors  and  poore  IVIarriners 
aboue  1000**  §""^'''^^§  so  farr  was  the  reputaron  of  this  Action  spread,  by 
the  prosperinge  thereof  vnder  the  latter  Governem',  &  by  their  zealous  & 
soUicitous  endeavours.  W'^''  although  by  the  continuall  encrease  of  further 
suffringes,  their  Pattent  being  called  in  question,  receaved  a  sore  check: 
yet  notw*''standing  their  owne  Innocencie  giving  them  courage  &  hope 
that  they  should  overcome  all  w***  honour  &  thankes  of  the  State:  there 
were  Five  shipps  provided  for  this  last  j^eare  1624  whereof  one  of  them 
since  the  Companies  dissoluf-on,  hath  given  over  her  voyage:  the  other 
foure  haue  proceeded,  although  w**"  much  difficulty,  in  reguard  that  a 
great  part  of  the  Passengers  that  afore  intended  to  goe,  fell  off.  Whereby 
two  of  the  Shipps  w"^*"  had  their  Comissions  from  y"  late  Companie  in  May 


APRIL  {?),  1625  527 

last,  could  not  gett  away  till  y**  end  of  this  last  yeare,  the  ©t-bei=  one  in 
February,  the  other  in  March  last. 

Thus  haue  wee  given  yo''  Lo"'  a  true  Informac'on,  both  of  the  growth  and 
languishinge  of  y"  Virginia  Plantacon,  in  these  Five  latter  yeares  [7] 
Governem':  wherein  no  encombrances,  no  calamities  whatsoever  could 
keepe  it  soe  downe,  but  that  it  did  yearely  advance  it  selfe  w"'  a  most 
remarkeable  growth,  whilst  the  carefuU  Nurse  and  tender  Mother  the 
Company  was  permitted  to  governe  it. 

Though  contagion  &  sword  destroyed  many  people:  yet  whilst  the  nomber 
of  new  did  doubly  supply  those  that  fayled,  it  cannot  be  said,  but  the 
Action  was  in  a  thriving,  in  a  prosperous  course;  though  not  in  a  cleare 
or  easy. 

Then  began  it  to  stand,  when  the  Companie  was  troubled;  to  stagger, 
when  they  were  disgracd  and  discountenanced;  to  sincke,  when  they  were 
terrifyed  w"'  affrightment  of  Dissolucon;  since  w"^''  tyme  there  hath  bin 
nothing  at  all  done  towards  the  recovery  or  helping  it  forward,  but  much 
towards  y®  hindringe  &  bringing  it  lower. 

The  poore  supply  of  People  &  shippes  that  are  gone,  are  but  the  rcmaynder 
of  the  late  Companies  cares  &  loves.  The  setters  out  of  the  best  of  them 
doe  affirme,  that  if  they  had  not  beene  so  farr  engaged  before  the  vnex- 
pected  dissolucon  of  y°  late  Companie,  they  would  haue  drawne  back 
their  Adventures  &  People. 

When  they  shall  arive  in  Virginia,  they  will  not  bring  either  comfort  or 
supply  to  the  Colonic:  but  only  add  to  their  Calamitie,  to  their  greife. 
The  first  Shipp  went  in  August,  victualled  only  for  Three  moneths:  the 
next  in  October:  neither  of  them  were  arived  the  25''*  of  February  last. 
Whereby  they  must  needs  come  into  Virginia  in  most  miseral^le  distresse. 

The  other  two  went  out  soe  meanly  provided,  that  how  euer  short  their 
voyage  shalbe,  they  cannot  but  prove  an  insupportable  charge  to  the 
Colony,  much  disfurnished  by  the  victualling  of  divers  shipps  lately 
returned  thence,  and  so  ill  provided  by  a  deceiptfull  cropp,  w'^''  seemed  large, 
but  proved  scant,  as  wee  dare  not  but  acquaynt  yo'  Lo''\     what  experience 


528  JiJ'XVRDS  OF  TlIK  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

perswades  vs,  That  there  is  hke  to  foUowe  in  the  Colonic  some  great  dis- 
tresse  for  victualls,  except  by  speedy  supply  hence  they  be  relieved. 

There  is  likewise  in  the  Colony  a  most  dangerous  want  of  Powder,  so  great, 
as  if  the  Savages  should  knowe  the  advantage  they  haue  therel)y,  they 
might  easily  in  one  day  destroy  all  o'  people. 

There  is  most  extreame  want  of  hose,  shooes,  &  all  apparrell,  even  to  a 
dangerous  empeachement  of  their  healthes:  and  that  so  generall,  as  the 
provisions  carried  in  these  late  Shipps,  will  not  as  farr  as  wee  cann  learne, 
su|)ply  the  Tenth  part  of  their  necessities. 

The  want  of  such  wonted  supplies,  will  vndoubtedly  nmch  dismay  & 
deicct  the  Colony.  But  when  they  shall  vnderstand  of  the  Companies 
dissoluf'on,  for  the  continuance  of  whose  Governem*  and  the  Liberties  they 
enioyed  vnder  them,  they  were  most  importunate  suitors  to  his  Ma*'*",  and 
that  they  are  returned  vnder  those  handes  w''h  they  so  much  abhorred: 
Wee  doubt  no  possible  meanes  wilbe  found  to  keepe  the  greatest  and  best 
part  of  the  Colonie  from  imediatly  cominge  away. 

[8]  For  wee  are  credibly  informed,  that  some  of  the  chiefs,  haue  allready 
by  sellinge  of  their  Estates,  made  preparacon  vpon  the  first  notice  of  the 
change,  to  leaue  the  Country.  But  when  farther  they  shall  heare  the 
newes  of  the  late  Contract,  whereby  all  their  hopes  shalbe  quite  extin- 
guished, and  all  possibilitie  of  subsistance  taken  from  them,  wee  cannot 
thinke  that  any  will  stay  behinde  that  shall  not  bee  kept  by  force. 

But  howsoeuer  it  shall  happen:  sure  wee  are  that  by  these  alteraeons  & 
courses  the  mindes  of  the  Planters  wilbe  filled  w'*'  such  Jealousies  &  sus- 
picions, as  it  wilbe  a  long  while  ere  they  wilbe  reduced  to  a  firme  resolucon 
of  setting  vp  the  Rest  of  their  Lives,  &  hojies,  in  the  Colony:  Which  w^*"  all 
humble  duty  wee  are  bold  to  say,  hath  bin  &  will  euer  bee  a  disposition 
most  pernicious  to  the  establishing  of  the  Plantation:  And  the  overcoming 
thereof  by  the  Company,  Wee  hokl  to  haue  bin  one  of  the  greatest  services 
that  they  did. 

This  wee  conceaue  to  be  y"  state  of  the  Colonie  now  in  Virginia.  W'*" 
though  they  should  be  persuaded  or  forced  to  stay,  yet  w"'out  supply  of 


APRIL  (:'),  16^5  529 

others  sent  hence,  they  must  needcs  come  to  nothinge  in  a  very  short 
space,  although  they  had  noe  other  enemy. 

As  for  adventuringe  hence,  what  by  the  disgracinge  of  the  Action  it  selfe, 
&  the  vndeserved  suffrings  of  the  late  Companie,  the  businesse  is  brought 
to  such  a  stand,  as  seemes  incredible:  there  being  no  preparacon  that  wee 
can  heare  of  not  only  of  any  Shipp,  but  of  any  man  to  goe  to  Virginia. 
Whereas  coinonly  for  divers  ycares  before,  there  were  foure  or  five  shipps 
in  readinesse,  and  as  many  hundreds  of  men,  at  this  tyme  of  y'^  yeare. 

So  that  even  in  that  reguard  also,  the  Colony  will  find  themselues  both  in 
great  discomfort,  &  great  danger.  For  although  formerly  they  had  no 
Forte  on  the  Land  to  hinder  a  forraigne  Enemy:  yet  especially  in  the 
latter  tymes,  there  was  such  aboundance  of  Shipping  cominge  and  goinge 
continually  to  Virginia,  that  there  hath  bin  sometymes  told  Seaventeene 
sayle  together  in  James  River.  Whereby  besides  that  it  was  a  continuall 
terror  to  the  Natives,  it  would  haue  bin  a  difficult  thinge  to  endamage 
the  Colonie,  w*''out  the  power  both  of  many  Shippes,  &  many  souldier.s. 
W^h  was  amongst  divers  others,  a  very  mayne  securitie  &  encouragement, 
to  perswade  men  boldly  to  goe  to  Virginia.  But  that  and  all  other  helpes 
being  now  foyled  or  much  empayred,  although  the  nomber  of  men  be  at 
least  Three  tymes  as  many  as  when  wee  vndertooke  the  Governem';  yet 
will  wee  Ingenuously  yeeld,  that  equall  thanks  &  equall  honour  wilbe  due 
to  them,  who  shall  now  recover  &  restore  it  to  that  prosperous  & 
flourishing  estate,  to  w"*"  by  Gods  blessinge  o''  cares  &  labours  had  brought 
it,  vntiU  it  was  marred  by  them,  who  as  appeares  never  loved  it,  but  for 
their  owne  indirect  ends,  w'^''  they  haue  industriously  pursued. 

[9]  Thus  much  touching  the  present  estate  of  the  Plantation,  &  the  late 
generall  decay  thereof.  Wherein  wee  hope  yo'  Lo^^  will  excuse  both  our 
playnes  &  prolixitie,  tending  to  no  other  end,  but  only  to  present  vnto 
yo''  Lo^^  viewe,  the  cleare  state  &  true  nature  of  the  disease;  that  so  yo' 
LoP"  in  yo'  great  wisedome  may  the  better  discerne  &  provide  the  proper 
remedies.  Towards  w"'',  since  yo'  Lo^"  haue  bin  also  pleased  to  require 
some  preparative  as  it  were  of  o'  opinions:  wee  will  now  humbly  apply 
o'selues  to  that  consideracon,  w'^'out  w'^'*,  all  the  rest  were  but  griefe  & 
labour.

tion, care,  &  preparaeon,  with  assurance  §also§  of  great  assistance. 

For  not  to  insist  much,  vpon  the  nature  &  greatnes  of  the  worke,  so  remote 
from  the  favourers,  so  vicine  to  mighty  Maligners  of  it:  and  indeed  fitter 
for  the  power  &  purse  of  a  Great  Prince  &  State,  then  of  private  Adven- 
ture", and  those  allready  exliaust  &  tyred;  the  wounds  w"^  since  that 
great  wound  of  the  Massacre,  it  hath  more  lately  receaved,  from  their 
handes  whom  it  least  beseemed,  are  still  so  wide  &  bleedinge,  that  vnlesse 
his  Ma"%  and  yo'  Lo"'  as  deputed  from  him,  shall  vouchsafe  to  apply  a 
Soveraine  hande  for  the  healing  of  them,  wee  are  resolute  of  opinion,  that 
it  is  impossible,  the  Plantation  carried  as  formerly  by  private  persons, 
should  either  prosi)er  or  long  subsist:  Those  woundes  wee  conceaue  are 
three 

First  the  generall  disreputacon  of  the  Busines,  (Reputation  being  a  prin- 
cipall  pillar  of  all  great  Actions,)  &  that  partly  by  some  errors,  neglects  & 
disasters,  but  principally  by  the  late  faction,  though  of  a  few  &  small 
Adventurers,  yet  strongly  &  strangely  inanimatcd  &  supported  agaynst  the 
great  Body  of  the  Companie:  whereof  in  fine  also  by  vndcrmining  misin- 
formacons  they  haue  wrought  y*"  Dissolucon;  &  consequently  lefte  all 
both  Adventurers  &  Planters,  in  an  vtter  vncertaynty  of  their  Rights, 
Titles  &  Possessions:  though  promise  was  made  that  they  should  be  re- 
assured to  them,  w"^'"  these  men  haue  neglected  to  see  performed. 

Secondly  the  great  discouragcm'  of  sundry  not  of  the  meanest  both  Ad- 
venturers &  Planters,  some  of  them  persons  of  honour,  and  others  also  of 
good  quallitie:  by  whose  cares  &  labours,  together  w***  their  freinds  & 
purses,  the  Plantation  having  formerly  receaved  no  small  encrcase  & 
benefitt,  to  the  Planters  great  comfort  <fe  content,  (w'^^''  |10]  they  haue  not 
forborne  from  tyme  to  tj'me  to  declare):  yet  liaue  they  by  the  vniust 
Calumnies  &  clamors  of  these  men,  bin  continually  jn-osecuted  w"'  all 
variety  of  extremitie,  to  y"  rewarding  of  them  with  evill  for  their  good 


APEIL  {?),  1G25  531 

deservings,  and  to  the  disheartining  of  all  other,  to  succeed  in  like  care  & 
industry. 

Thirdly  the  present  extreame  povertie  &  consumpcon  of  y"  Plantacon,  being 
for  want  of  the  accustomed  yearely  supplies,  reduced  to  that  paucitie  of 
men,  &  want  of  all  sorts  well  neere  of  necessary  provisions,  that  it  cannot  be 
restored,  but  w""  an  huge  expence,  no  lesse  allmost  then  to  sett  vp  a  new 
Plantation. 

Nowe  touching  the  disreputacon  of  y''  Action,  and  the  generall  disheartiu- 
inge  of  the  Adventurers  &  Planters,  such  especially  as  haue  spared  neither 
paynes  nor  expence,  for  y"  recoveringe,  supportinge  &  advancinge  the 
Plantation:  Wee  humbly  craue  yo''  Lo"^  favourable  patience,  though  wee 
somewhat  enlarge  our  selues  in  this  place,  to  present  in  part  the  Iniustice  & 
greaviousncs  of  those  wounds  to  the  hono""'"  minds  &  skilfuU  hand?  of  yo'' 
Lo"^:  Seeing  that  in  our  vnderstandinge,  the  curing  of  them  by  yo'  Lo''", 
may  be  a  meanes  to  revive  agayne  the  generally  deadded  hearty  of  both 
Adventurers  &  Planters,  &  to  adde  a  new  lustre  &  grace  to  y"  Action. 

Amongst  the  many  glorious  workes  of  the  late  Kinge,  there  was  none  more 
eminent,  then  his  Gracious  enclination,  together  w""  y"  propagation  of 
Christian  Religion,  to  advance  &  sett  forward  a  new  Plantacon  in  the  new 
world.  W'^''  purpose  of  his  continued  till  the  last,  manifested  by  his  Ma'^ 
many  publiq'  &  private  speeches  by  divers  Lres  of  his,  &  by  his  sundry 
Proclamacons;  so  that  their  faults  are  farr  the  greater,  who,  as  imediatly 
shalbe  declared,  did  malitiously  and  cunningly  pervert  those  Gracious 
intencons  of  his  Ma'''=  by  scandalizing  y"  Governem'  as  it  then  stood,  as 
neither  convenient  here,  nor  likely  there  to  advance  the  prosperitie  of  the 
Colonic;  and  by  insinuatinge  assurances,  that  they  them.selues  would 
mayntayne  that  worke  by  better  meanes.  which  his  Ma^'"  conceavinge  (as 
it  was  reason)  they  would  not  so  boldly  haue  promised  of  them  selues,  being 
so  great  a  worke,  vnlesse  they  had  had  both  knowledge,  &  meanes  to  goe 
thorough  w""  it;  did  also  belieue:  &  so  they  became  y*"  Vndertakers. 

And  now,  as  it  hath  bin  euer  farr  from  o'  practize,  and  agaynst  o""  present 
Desires,  to  fall  vpon  the  persons  of  any  men,  where  y^  necessitie  &  justice 
of  y^  cause  doth  not  necessarilie  require  it:  yet  at  this  tyme  it  is  impossible 
to  cleere  this  pointe  to  yo''  Lo^^  without  [11]  naming  some  of  their  persons, 
and  perticularizing  their  Actions.     About  Six  yeares  agoe,  when  by  reason 


532  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMI'AXV 

of  the  apparent  misprosperinge  of  the  Plantation,  and  the  fowlencs  of  the 
Accounts  here,  (the  then  Treasuror  being  Governour  of  Fower  or  Five 
other  Companies,  v,'"^  excused  his  neglect  of  attending  this  busines,)  the 
Governem'  of  the  Companie  was  translated  from  S'  Thomas  Smith  and 
Aldfan  Johnson,  into  S'  Edwin  Sandis,  &  after  into  the  Earle  of  Southamp- 
tons  hands,  &  their  Deputies:  it  is  notororiously  knowne,  how  thoy,  w"" 
Captayne  ArgoU  and  other  of  their  freinds,  partly  peradvcnture  through 
discontent  for  being  removed  from  their  places,  but  principally  through 
feare;  (their  Accounts,  Depredacons,  Piracies  &  misgovernem'  being  now 
questiond  before  the  Counsell  and  in  the  Companies  Courts,)  perpetually 
disturbed  &  disgraced  by  scuerall  wayes,  both  to  his  Ma''"  &  to  the  world, 
all  the  present  proceedinges  of  the  Companie,  to  y""  great  disheartininge  of 
the  Companie  here,  and  no  small  advantage  of  y*  Colonie.  And  of  this, 
and  of  the  bad  effects  of  it,  all  our  bookes,  &  memories  are  full.  But  yet 
by  Gods  assistance,  &  the  vnwearied  courage  of  the  Companie,  wee  ridd 
out  this  storme. 

The  next  blowe,  as  wee  had  reason  to  belicue,  proceeding  by  their  vnder- 
hand  raysinge  of  new  spiritts,  drawne  to  disturbe  vs  for  their  owne  gayne 
was  the  bringing  in  of  new  &  seuerall  projects  concerning  Tobacco:  w'^''  was 
for  the  instant  the  only  comoditie  whereby  the  Planters  mayntayned  them- 
selucs.  And  so  vnder  colour  of  advancing  proffitt  to  his  Ma''"  sometimes 
(as  hath  bin  before  touched)  wee  were  forbidden  to  bring  in  any  Tobacco, 
sometimes  to  bring  in  but  a  small  quantitie,  and  sometimes  comaunded  to 
bring  in  all.  W"**  varying  directions,  did  so  distract  &  confound  the 
Adventurers  &  Planters,  that  it  had  in  a  manner  ruynd  the  Plantation. 
But  yet  by  Gods  assistance,  &  the  constancy  of  y"  Companie,  wee  ridd  out 
this  storme  also.  The  nistruments  in  this  workc,  that  especialhe  ajipcarcd 
were  the  then  S''  Lionell  Cranfield,  M"'  Jacob,  and  some  others:  to  the 
extreame  damage  of  the  Company,  enrichcnient  of  them  selues,  &  decej-t 
of  his  Ma"'':  as  was  at  large  expressed  &  ofl'rcd  to  lie  jiroved  in  y"  last 
Parliament. 

Thirdly,  by  the  procurem*  of  that  ]mvt,  divers  scandalous  peticons  agaynst 
tlic  Company  in  generall,  &  many  in  perticuler,  did  putt  vs  to  much 
vexacon  &  trouble.  But  their  accusacons  were  so  false,  that  wee  also 
overcame  this  Third  assault. 


APRIL  {?),  1625  533 

After  this  another  stratagem  was  obtruded  vpon  vs,  vnder  pretence  of 
freindship  &  love  to  y"  Plantation.  The  Earle  of  Middesex  then  Lo: 
high  Treasuror  of  England,  who  in  respect  of  his  place  was  [12]  to  take  into 
consideraf'on  all  thinges  that  had  relaeon  to  his  Ma*"  revenue,  did  first  pro- 
pound to  S"'  Edwin  Sandis,  &  afterwards  to  y""  Ea:  of  Southampton,  y''  Lo: 
Cavendish  &  S''  Edwin  Sandis  together,  that  the  King,  he  knewe,  had  by 
S"'  Thomas  Smithes  meanes  &  Alderman  Johnsons,  and  some  great  frcinds 
&  instruments  of  theires,  bin  strangely  possessed  agaynst  the  forme  of  our 
Governem',  &  y"  consequences  of  it:  &  particulerly  that  they  had  made 
such  advantage  by  traducing  y"  names  of  y"  Earle  of  Southampton  and  S' 
Edwin  Sandis,  that  y'=  busines  of  y''  Plantacon  fared  y*"  worse  for  their  sakes. 
That  he  had  allready  in  Generall  spoken  w""  his  Ma"°,  &  assured  him,  that 
y*'  whispers  &  relacons  of  those  men,  had  an  eye  to  their  owne  safetie,  and 
not  to  the  Colonies  good ;  and  that  therevpon  the  King  referred  the  whole 
consideracon  of  y"  Plantation,  and  what  was  best  to  be  done,  to  his  care. 
Vpon  this  he  propounded  vnto  those  before  named,  that  y"  best  way  to 
engage  the  Kinge  in  his  care  of  the  Plantations,  and  to  make  it  impossible 
for  any  hereafter  to  disturbe  the  Companie,  as  they  had  formerly  done, 
was  to  thinke  of  some  such  meanes,  whereby  the  proffitt  of  his  IMa*'*',  & 
the  good  of  y''  Plantation,  might  hand  in  hand  goe  together.  And  to 
speake  truth,  though  those  he  spoke  w^'all,  were  at  first  very  vnwilling  to 
swallowe  this  guilded  pill,  as  having  heard  of  y"  stile  he  vsed  in  negotiatingc 
other  businesses  of  this  nature:  yet  he  was  so  full  of  protestacons  in  it,  euer 
pretending  etw  ||  the  Companies  ||  good,  and  w'*'  all  procured  further  inti- 
macon  to  y'"  Earle  of  Southampton,  that  no  service  of  his  could  be  more 
acceptable  to  his  IVIa''^  then  this  now  propounded:  |I  that  ||  Vpon  these 
protestaf'ons  &  assurance,  they  engaged  themselues  to  treat  of  a  Contract 
betweene  his  Ma'^'  &  the  Companies.  In  the  making  whereof,  y*^  said 
Earle  of  Midd  remembred  not  his  promised  care  of  y*"  Plantations,  but  in 
truth  from  one  degree  to  another,  wrested  vs  to  such  condiOons,  &  such  a 
rate,  as  was  very  dammeagle  to  y"  Plantaeons.  But  vpon  serious  debate 
in  many  &  full  Courts,  vpon  the  whole  matter  wee  were  resolved,  consider- 
ing the  protection  of  the  Colonies,  &  fauour  promised ;  and  to  be  free  from 
those  frequent  proiects  that  in  former  tymes  had  so  much  wronged  &  dis- 
turbed vs,  to  accept  an  hard  bargayne:  conceavinge  that  though  it  were  not 
so  good  as  wee  desired,  &  was  fitt  to  haue  bin  offerd;  yet  by  it  wee  should 


534  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGIXIA  COMl'AXY 

bee  in  a  better  case  &  way  of  benefitting  the  Plantations,  then  formerly 
wee  were.  And  so  in  Michaelmas  terme  1622  this  Contract  w'^''  began  to 
be  treated  of  in  Easter  terme,  was  concluded  by  the  subscription  of  the 
Earle  of  Middlesex  his  hand,  and  by  sending  the  Company  word,  that  that 
day  the  §  whole  §  Counsell  board  had  given  their  assent  therevnto,  w'^''  was 
the  first  tyme  tlie  Companie  vnderstood  that  they  had  heard  of  y'=  matter. 

[13]  The  Contract  thus  concluded,  a  great  Tempest  arose,  by  what  secrctt 
cause  &  vnderhand  procurement,  wee  may  guesse,  but  cannot  affirme. 
But  in  a  Court  of  the  Company  vpon  the  4"^  of  December  foUowinge,  one 
M''  Wrote  Cosen  Germane  to  the  Earle  of  Middlesex  (discontented  also 
that  hee  was  passed  ouer  in  the  election  of  Officers,)  did  w"'  a  passionate  & 
blastring  speech,  inveigh  agaynst  the  Contract,  &  the  menaging  thereof 
w'^  Sallary;  agaynst  the  proceeding  in  the  Treaty  of  it,  as  that  it  had  bin 
vnduly  and  vniustly  carried,  that  men  had  bin  overawed;  and  that  it  had 
bin  procured  to  private  ends.  Whereof  not  being  able  to  make  any 
shadowe  of  proofe,  &  persisting  still  in  his  violent  &  contemptuous 
demcano'',  vpon  a  full  hearinge,  he  was  thrust  out  of  the  Companie;  and 
vpon  that  ioyncd  himself e  to  S''  Thomas  Smith,  Alderman  Johnson  &  that 
opposite  party,  &  drewe  also  w"*  him  Two  more  of  his  Companions,  and  so 
now  made  shewe  of  a  formal!  party  agaynst  the  Company.  But  for  all 
this  wee  still  mayntayncd  the  reputaron  of  o'  proceedinge. 

The  next  of  o'  troubles  in  order,  (proceeding  from  what  secrett  cause,  that 
w'=''  foUowcs  will  give  yo''  Lo'"''  more  reason  of  coniecture,  then  wcc  will 
now  affirme,)  was  that  this  opposite  party  then  attayned  to  about  25 
in  nomber,  had  some  secrett  encouragem'  or  other  given  them,  directly 
to  oppugne  the  Contract;  w''h,  as  is  before  declared,  was  so  formally 
made:  And  gaue  some  reasons  in  writing  agaynst  it  to  the  then  Lord  Trer; 
who  receaving  them,  gaue  the  Company  first  suspicon  of  double  intelligence 
&  indirectnes  in  his  dealinge.  But  howsoeuer,  the  Earle  of  Southampton, 
the  Lo:  Cavendish,  S'  Edwin  Sandis  &  some  other,  being  called  by  the 
Earh-  of  Middlesex  to  liis  Chamber  at  Whitehall,  then  thought,  that  they 
had  given  such  answeres  to  them,  as  that  his  Lo"  rested  satisfied.  But 
his  LoP  after,  speaking  w'h  y"  Ea:  of  South'ton  and  the  rest  before  named 
told  them,  that  they  that  had  aopposed,  were  a  clamorous  Company, 
and  that  to  make  the  busincs  goc  current,  it  were  best  that  their  objections 


APRIL  (?),  1625  535 

&  o''  answeres  should  be  heard  at  the  Couusell  table.  And  vpon  hearing 
there  of  their  accusacons,  and  o''  answeres,  the  Earle  of  Middlesex,  who 
assumed  the  chiefe  knowledge  &  care  of  that  busines,  did  in  y"  close  of 
that  hearinge  vse  the  words  formerly  rehearsed,  Of  the  leaud  carriage  in 
former  tymes,  and  of  the  latter  in  a  manner  miraculous  recoverie.  A 
greater  testimony  of  o''  integritie  &  their  guilt,  could  not  be  given.  But 
as  the  sequell  will  manifest,  &  as  wee  haue  since  found  in  other  of  his  Lo^'^ 
proceedings,  he  meant  to  loose  nothing  by  those  word^.  [14]  Howsoeuer 
it  was,  &  whatsoever  wee  suspect,  not  intending  now  to  dive  into  those 
miseries;  from  that  day  forward,  to  y"  Conclusion  of  this  busines  he 
professedly  made  himselfe  the  patron  to  that  side,  &  enemy  to  the  Com- 
pany; for  w'"h  wee  appeale  to  yo''  Lo""  better  knowledge. 

Afterward?  about  that  Contract  were  divers  meetings  before  the  Lord?, 
where  it  was  principally  inveighed  agaynst  by  S''  Nathaniell  Rich,  speaking 
against  the  iniustice  &  vnconscionablenes  of  it;  protesting  that  he  had 
euer  sold  his  Tobacco  for  Fine  shillings  a  pound  one  w*h  another,  and 
that  euery  pound  cost  him  Two  shillings  six  pence  in  y""  Sumer  Islands: 
and  now  to  give  a  Third  away  |lto  the  King||  &  peradventure  y"  price 
not  to  l^e  much  higher,  was  agaynst  Justice  &  Conscience.  And  here  by 
the  way,  wee  humbly  craue  leaue  to  say  thus  much,  that  his  Conscience 
now  serues  him  in  this  new  Contract,  to  force  y**  Planter  &  the  Adventurer 
to  sell  their  Tobacco,  the  best  sort  for  2^  4''  and  the  second  sort  at  sixteenc 
pence  a  pound.  But  vpon  that  former  Demonstrative  Argument  of  his, 
though  it  were  so  fully  answered  as  nothing  could  be  more,  yet  the  Earle 
of  Middlesex  tooke  his  ground  to  condcmne  the  Contract  he  had  signed, 
as  hurtfuU  to  the  Plantacons;  and  to  comaund  the  Companies  to  thinke 
of  propounding  a  better  &  to  to  bring  it  ||in||  writing  w*''in  Two  dales: 
W4i  was  accordingly  done:  and  therein  shewed,  that  y"  hardnesse  of  this 
Contract,  was  not  by  the  Companies  proposition,  but  by  his  Lo^^  pressure. 
And  therefore  vrgcd  what  had  bin  off  red  to  his  Lo^  at  the  first;  that  his 
Ma''"  would  be  contented  w'h  a  fourth,  &  not  require  a  Third  of  o""  Tobacco. 
To  w^h  in  great  scorne  his  Lo"  replyed  that  take  Two  pence  out  of  Six 
pence  there  would  rcmayne  a  Groat.  But  the  last  Parliament  sawe 
that  his  best  invention,  was  by  adding  3''  to  40"  to  make  vp  Five  pound. 
But  in  conclusion  that  Contract  was  dissolved,  &  a  comaund  laid  vpon 


536  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

the  Conipanics  by  his  Lu''"  procurcinciit,  to  bring  all  o'  Tobaccoes  in,  vnder 
colour  that  Three  pence  custome  was  abated;  Whereas  in  truth,  by  his 
admitting  also  of  all  Spanish  Tobacco  vpon  S'  John  Wolstenholmes 
motion,  wee  could  not  vent  a  third  part  of  it  here:  and  so  by  computacon, 
in  respect  of  the  quantitie  vnvented,  wee  paid  neere  double  as  much  as 
before:  W4i  was  his  only  favour  to  y"  Plantations. 

The  Contract  thus  dissolved,  as  publiq'ly  damageable,  by  the  incourage- 
ment  of  the  Earle  of  Middlesex,  &  industry  of  y"  Five  and  twenty  before 
menconed,  (that  so  place  might  be  made  for  this  [15]  Latter  Contract, 
so  privatly  beneficiall,  for  so  by  the  effect  it  hath  appeared) :  the  Governem' 
was  now  likewise  to  be  questiond  and  altred,  or  else  they  compassed  not 
their  end^.  Which  to  bring  about,  these  two  wayes  were  vsed:  First  a 
peticon  was  delivered  to  his  Ma'^  by  Allderman  Johnson,  in  the  name  of 
the  rest,  inveighing  agaynst  the  latter  Governem*,  &  magnifying  the 
former.  And  in  the  end,  desiring  a  Comission  to  examine  the  proceedings 
of  thi§e§s§e§  last  Fower  yeares  This  Peticon  was  by  the  Company  at 
large  answered  to  his  Ma*^,  &  wee  ioyned  in  y'^  point  of  having  o'  Actions 
examined  by  the  Comission:  but  w'hall  thought  it  iust,  &  desired,  that 
their  Twelue  yeares  Governem'  before  might  bee  also  examined:  W'^h 
accordingly  was  ordered.  The  second  meanes  vsed  by  them,  was  to 
rayse  vp  Captayne  Butler,  who  hasting  from  the  Suiner  Ilandcs  to 
Virginia,  where  he  stayed  but  a  few  weekes,  vpon  his  returne  delivered 
to  his  Ma*^,  a  Paper  called  The  Vnmasking  of  Virginia.  The  substance 
of  Wh  was,  first  the  dispraise  of  the  Country,  &  making  of  it  an  vnfitt 
place  for  any  English  Colony;  &  next,  scandalizing  the  Governem*  of  it, 
both  here,  &  there.  What  concerned  the  Colonie,  was  proved  to  be 
false  by  Forty  witnesses:  who  chaunced  to  be  in  Towne  then,  &  had  bin 
often  &  long  in  y"  C^olonie:  And  was  endeavored  to  be  mayntayncd  by 
him  by  two  meanes  only:  one  by  practizing  to  gett  the  hand^  of  Two  men 
vnto  it,  to  whome  he  owed  mony  &  deferred  payment:  who  when  they 
heard  it  read  in  Co'',  protested  that  they  never  saw  what  they  sett  their 
hands  to,  and  that  Capt:  Butler  told  them  it  was  to  a  Paper,  w^h  he  would 
shew  the  King  for  the  good  of  the  Plantation:  and  desired  y"  Companies 
pardon;  for  whatsoeuer  was  there  said  was  false.  Secondly  he  would 
haue  made  it  to  hauc  bin  better  believed,  by  a  forged  Lre  w'"''  hee  brought 
to  S'  John   Bourchi(>r  from  his  daughter  AP"  Whittakcrs:  who  knevv'  it 


APRIL  {?),  1625  537 

was  not  her  hand  '.     This  was  alleadged  at  y"  Counsell  Table:  &  Capt' 

Butler  answered,  that  shee  was  sicke,  &  dictated  it  to  him,  and  he  wrote  it. 
But  since,  both  shee  &  her  husband  being  come  ouer,  they  bothc  forsweare 
it,  &  say  it  was  none  of  her  doinge  nor  direction.  But  howsoeuer,  by 
those  meanes  the  opposite  party  thus  farre  obteyned  their  ends,  that 
by  the  Defamation,  and  this  trouble  ensuinge,  a  very  great  nombcr  that 
intended  to  haue  gone  ouer,  were  discouraged. 

[16]  But  yet  for  all  this,  the  Companie  knewe  their  cause  to  be  so  iust  and 
iustifiable,  that  they  did  not  abandon  it:  but  prepared  themselues  to  give 
divers  charges  before  y"  Comission''',  agaynst  divers  of  y"  partie  opposite; 
&  professed  themselues  ready  to  make  their  owne  defence  whensoever  they 
should  be  charged.  But  whilst  the  Comission  sate,  farther  to  discourage 
vs,  first  of  all  o''  Bookes,  &  after  y^  Minutes  of  them  were  sent  for  away  from 
vs:  that  none  of  the  Lres  that  then  came  from  Virginia  were  to  be  seene  by 
vs,  being  all  seazed  on  by  the  Comission".  But  touching  the  rest  of  y" 
Cariage  of  that  Comission,  because  it  was  at  large  delivered  in  Parliament, 
&  offered  to  be  proved,  if  further  proceedinge  in  that  businesse  had  not  bin 
forborne  vpon  a  Lre  written  to  y"  house  from  his  Ma''*"  wee  will  now  to 
yo"^  Lqp^  say  only  this;  That  whatsoever  was  brought  by  vs  concerninge 
Accounts,  Depredaf'on,  misgovernement,  &  diuers  other  crimes,  agaynst 
perticuler  persons,  was  by  this  Comission,  (especially  directed  by  the  Earle 
of  Midd,)  shuffled  of  for  all  the  tyme,  till  the  Comission  was  even  at  y- 
end,  and  nothing  done  vpon  them.  And  on  y"  Contrary,  whatsoever 
could  be  gathered  out  of  the  fragments  of  Lres  from  discontented  persons 
in  Virginia,  concerning  ||either||  the  place  or  governem*  was  diligently 
collected  by  them,  and  receaued  by  the  Earle  of  Middlesex,  as  a  great 
testimony  agaynst  vs;  and  would  not  take  those  other  Lres  for  proofe 
w'^''  wee  euer  guided  o''selves  by,  and  came  from  the  Governour  and  Coun- 
sell there.  And  lastly  some  three  days  before  their  Comission  ended,  tliey 
putt  vs  on  a  sodayne  to  answere  to  39  Articles,  or  else  they  would  take 
them  pro  confesso.  This  they  thought  for  vs  unpossible  to  doe.  But  wee 
deceaved  their  expectacon ;  and  they  could  not  find  in  the  least  perticuler, 
any  iust  ground  to  make  any  report  agaynst  vs. 

'  Manuscript  illegible,  but  it  may  be — "but  answered  that  she  was  sick". 


538  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

By  all  this,  the  Earle  of  Middlesex  and  that  partie,  perceaving  y**  Companie 
would  not  be  beaten  off  a  good  cause;  there  was  a  practise  to  try  whither 
wee  had  rather  part  from  the  busines,  or  from  our  mony.  Wherevpon  wee 
were  called  before  the  Counsell  agayne,  and  there  that  side  as  compassion- 
ate affecters  of  the  Plantation,  vrged  the  want  of  Corne  &  other  necessaries 
there,  and  that  they  were  like  to  perish  for  want  of  provisions.  The  Earle 
of  Midd  replyed  it  was  a  matter  of  so  great  importance,  &  concerned  the 
hues  of  so  many  of  the  Kings  Subjects,  that  if  y*^  Companie  would  not 
presently  take  order  for  sending  Supplies,  the  State  would  call  in  their 
Pattent.  Wherevpon  y''  Companie  conceavinge  that  if  they  did  send 
supplyes,  their  Patent  would  not  [17]  be  taken  from  them,  vndcrwritt  to  a 
Roule;  (though  they  knewe  y^  necessitie  was  nothing  so  great,)  foure 
thousand  and  odd  pounds,  w'^''  was  paid  and  sent;  and  those  Gentlemen  that 
before  seemed  so  zealous  subscribed  Twelue  pound?,  and  paid  it  not. 
Vpon  w'^h  comparison  wee  leaue  it  to  3^0''  Lo''"  to  iudge,  w^*"  partj'  was  the 
true  father  of  this  Child. 

This  then  not  succeeding  according  to  their  desires,  certayne  obscure 
persons  were  found  out  by  the  Earle  of  IMidd,  to  be  sent  into  Virginia,  as 
Comission",  for  these  two  ends,  as  wee  haue  since  found.  First  to  sifte 
out  what  they  could  agaynst  the  forme  of  o'  Governem'  here,  &  there;  & 
next  to  persuade  the  people  to  become  Peticone"  to  his  Ma'"^  for  a  newe. 
W''''  succeeded  not  according  to  their  expectacon.  For  by  the  Colonies 
Pcticons,  answeres  to  those  Papers  that  had  bin  deUvered  agaynst  them 
here,  &  divers  other  remonstrances  to  his  Ma*'"  from  a  Generall  Assembly 
there,  they  shewed  the  misery  wherein  they  lived,  or  rather  languished  in  S'' 
Thomas  Smithes  tyme;  and  their  happy  estate  in  this  latter  Governement: 
concludinge  I  hat  if  his  Ma'^  intended  to  alter  the  Governement,  &  putt  it 
into  the  former  haiids,  their  humble  suite  to  him  was,  That  Comission" 
might  be  sent  ouer  to  another  purpose  before  declared.  The  writinges 
themselues  will  manifest  this  more  at  large. 

These  Comissione''  thus  sent  to  Virginia,  the  Earle  of  Midd  &  the  rest 
were  not  idle  in  further  distractinge  the  Companie  here  at  home.  And 
about  Michaelmas  a  mocon  was  made  to  the  Companie,  to  give  their  assents 
for  surrendring  their  Pattent,  &  altringe  the  forme  of  Governem*;  &  a 
newe  one  was  proposed:  \\^^  according  to  order  they  takinge  into  consid-

eraC'on,  w'^''  duetie  refused:  rendring  also  in  writing  the  reasons  of  their 
refusal].  Wherevpon  a  Quo  Warranto  was  directed  by  the  Earle  of  Midd 
suggestion,  for  the  calling  in  of  their  Pattent. 

In  the  meane  time,  to  affright  men,  both  from  cominge  to,  &  much  more 
from  speakinge  in  Courts,  mens  words  were  there  carped  at  &  complayned 
of;  and  their  persons  by  the  Earle  of  Midd  prosequution,  were  vpon  quick 
hearinge  sent  to  prison.  Yet  for  all  this  the  Comp9  stood  to  their  owne 
Justificaeon,  &  defence  of  their  Pattent. 

Now  M"'  Atturney,  according  to  y"  duty  of  his  place,  &  instructions  given 
him,  vrged  y"  misgovernem*  of  the  Companie,  &  consequently  y''  ruyne 
of  the  Plantation.  To  mv"^  point  wee  were  willinge  to  ioyne  issue.  But 
afterwards  in  o'  reply  to  his  pleadinge,  w*out  further  enquiry  of  the 
former  allegation,  advantage  was  taken  vpon  o''  mispleading,  &  in  fine 
w^'out  any  further  ground  that  wee  knowe  of,  the  Patent  was  in  Trinity 
terme  following  Condemned:  But  for  any  thing  that  wee  haue  yet  seene, 
no  iudgment  entred. 

[18]  Yo''  LoP^  by  the  perticulers  before  related,  do  see  by  what  courses 
wee  were  reduced  to  this  extremitie.  One  thing  yet  wee  thinke  most 
necessary  to  adde;  It  hath  bin  said  by  many,  &  perticulerly  by  some 
principall  persons  of  the  opposite  partie,  that  y°  Dissolutions  of  these 
Plantacons  was  part  of  the  Count  of  Gondomars  Instructions:  And 
certaynely  wee  found  his  activenes  in  negotiatinge  here,  such,  that  in 
bringing  about  his  owne  ends,  he  could  create  here  instruments  of  o\selues 
agaynst  our  selues.  Wee  say  not  that  he  &  other  Spanish  Ministers 
practised  thus  amongst  vs.  These  two  only  perticulers,  wee  craue  leaue 
to  offer  vnto  yo"'  Lo^"  Judgem'*^.  When  S'  Samuell  ArgoU  some  six  or 
seauen  yeares  since,  was  vehemently  complayned  agaynst,  by  Padre 
Maestro,  and  the  Spanish  Secretarie  then  here  for  Piracie,  agaynst  the 
Kinge  of  Spaines  subiects  in  y^  West  Indies:  he  no  sooner  came  home  from 
Virginia,  &  appeared  an  Opposite  to  y**  present  Company,  who  question'd 
him  for  divers  misdemeano",  and  amongst  others  for  this,  but  the  heate 
of  the  Spanish  accusacon  did  presently  cease.  Our  second  observacon  in 
this;  Yo''  Lo"^  cannot  but  remember,  w"'  what  extreame  earnestnes  the 
Count  of  Gondomar,  and  afterwards  Don  Carlo  di  Coloma,  inveighed 
agaynst  Capt9  Butler  whilst  he  was  in  y^  Summer  Islandes,  about  y* 


540  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

Spanish  wrack.  And  so  violent  were  they  about  it,  that  y°  Lo:  Steward, 
now  w""  God,  and  the  Lo:  Chaniberlaine,  were  entreated  to  come  on  pur- 
pose to  the  Suiuer  Islands  Company,  about  that  busines.  And  a  Comission 
was  directed  by  the  Lords  of  the  Counsell,  to  examine  the  truth  of  the 
cause  in  y"  Sumer  Islands.  W'''  Captaine  Butler  having  bin  forewarned 
of  by  some  freinds  of  his,  lefte  his  Governem'  before  he  had  leaue,  and 
before  the  arivall  of  the  Comission:  Having  first  there  endeauoured  to 
alienate  the  minds  of  the  people  from  the  forme  of  Go\'ernem'  here.  But 
he  was  no  sooner  come  home,  &  dcli^•ered  to  his  Ma''°  The  Vnmasking  of 
Virginia  before  spoken  of,  but  there  was  an  end  of  Don  Carlo  Di  Colomars 
jiroseciuution.    Wee  haue  related  the  particulars;  &  make  no  application. 

As  for  y""  late  Comission,  w^'h  hath  succeeded  in  y*^  place  of  the  Companie; 
if  wee  might  haue  seene  the  busines  seriously  taken  into  the  Graue  cares, 
&  proscquuted  w*""  the  Noble  paynes  of  those  most  hono'''"  personages, 
whose  names  are  inserted  in  the  sayd  Comission:  wee  should  haue  hoped 
to  haue  seene  some  good  effect  [19]  befitting  tlicir  great  &  eminent  worth. 
But  whilst  their  more  weighty  Affaires  haue  hindred  them,  the  businesse 
hath  bin  principally  carried  only  by  those  persons,  tliat  were  the  chiefe 
Opposers  of  the  late  Comp9,  For  although  there  be  named  divers  worthy 
Gentlemen,  &  Cittizens  likewise,  in  y''  Comission:  yet  as  wee  vnderstand, 
the  most  of  them  haue  forborne  altogether  to  appeare  at  any  meetinge. 
Wherefore  when  either  in  o''  wordes  or  thoughts,  wee  complayne  of  any 
proceedings  of  the  late  Comission;  wee  allwayes  except  both  all  y"  persons 
of  Honour,  &  indifferency:  and  onely  intend  those  others,  whose  stomacks 
were  so  great,  as  they  durst  vndertake  the  overthrowinge  of  the  late 
Companie;  and  yet  their  harts  so  narrow,  as  they  haue  not  dared  to 
adventure  all  of  them  during  these  Nyne  moneths,  as  farr  as  wee  can 
learne,  one  five  poundes  to  y''  advancem'  or  subsistance  of  the  Plantation. 

By  the  publiq'  tres  of  y*  Gouernour  delivered  them  in  Jul}-  last,  they 

.31   July   1024.     vnderstood  of  y"  extreame  want  of  Powder  in  y"  Colonic:  and  were  often 

way  for  powder  told  from  vs  of  the  great  danger  that  might  ensue  thereby.     Yet  did  they 

0^2  in'storlf'  °"^  neglect  y"  sending  of  any  in  the  first  Shipp,  or  in  y"  Second:  but  about 

Christmas,  &  since  in  March,  they  haue  sent  a  small  fjuantitie,  obteynod 

by  his  late  Ma^°  guift  (as  wee  heare)  out  of  the  Tower. 

'  In  pencil. 


APRIL  (?),  1625  541 

This  did  not  y"  late  Company:  who  vpon  notice  of  y""  Massacre,  did  by  the 
first  shipp  send  42  Barrells  of  Powder;  for  halfe  whereof  the  Officers  having 
disbursed  the  mony,  are  yet  vnsatisfied. 

Whereas  all  tlie  Fower  shippcs  now  sent,  were  i:)repared  in  y  C()rap''"''  tynie; 
these  last  Comissioners  callinge  in  the  Comissions  graunted  them  by  the 
late  Company,  made  them  take  newe  as  from  themselues;  that  so  they 
might  glory  vpon  anothers  foundacon:  But  whilst  they  thus  hunted  after 
windy  ambition,  hindringe  the  two  first  Shipps  from  takinge  a  faire  winde; 
they  haue  bin  the  causes  of  all  the  lamentable  calamities  &  distresses,  w'''' 
in  so  long  voyages  must  needs  befall  them. 

The  principall  scope  of  his  late  Ma*'  Comission  to  them,  as  wee  vnderstand, 
was,  that  they  should  finde  a  better  forme  of  Governmen'  for  the  Plantacons 
advancement;  and  therein  is  especially  promised  the  conservacon  of  euery 
mans  right.  Intentions  worthy  the  wisedome  &  Justice  of  so  great  a 
Prince.  But  as  farr  as  wee  can  vnderstand,  these  Comission"  haue  done 
nothing  towards  either  of  these  ends:  But  quite  contrary  to  y''  second. 

[20]  By  an  vnknowne  Contract,  w'""  themselues  will  not  so  much  as  declare, 
much  lesse  are  able  to  defend;  they  haue  sought  to  share  amongst  them- 
selues, twice  as  much  vpon  euerj^  mans  goods,  as  they  will  leaue  to  the 
Owner  thereof.  And  although  they  say  only  three  of  them  are  Contracto" 
yet  wee  cannot  belieue  it;  having  observed  the  ends  of  some  of  them  for 
many  yeares,  to  haue  constantly  bin  bent  to  the  compassinge  of  some  such 
advantage,  as  they  haue  now  by  this  bargayne  gayned. 

It  is  constantly  reported  that  they  haue  liberally  given  that  w"''  was  not 
their  owne,  to  those  who  haue  no  right  thereto;  as  namely  the  Colonies 
Mine  to  S'  Samuell  Argoll,  &  M'  Woodall  surgion  to  S""  Thomas  Smith. 
But  this  &  all  their  other  proceedinges  are  kept  in  great  secrett:  w'^''  breeds 
suspicon  that  they  haue  not  bin  good;  else  why  doe  they  fly  the  Light? 
This  is  cleane  contrary  to  y"  vse  of  the  late  Company:  who  did  all  thinges 
in  publiq5:  w'^''  was  a  cause  of  §as§  great  satisfaccon,  as  this  of  Distaste. 

And  as  in  this,  so  in  all  other  thinges  do  they  proceed  cleane  contrary  to 
all  right  in  o''  vnderstandinge.  They  publish  their  Intention  of  imployinge 
S'  Samuell  ArgoU  &  Captaine  Butler  for  Governours  agayne  in  the  Plan- 


542  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGIXEi  COMPANY 

tatioiis:  agaynst  whoine  the  Colony  hath  professed  open  enmity.  How 
they  should  make  y''  Colony  encrease  by  these  meanes,  w'*'  will  luring  home 
most  of  them  that  are  there  allready,  wee  cannot  imagine. 

Neither  are  S'  Thomas  Smith  nor  Alderman  Johnson  fitt  or  likely  men 
to  revnite  the  late  Companie,  or  to  drawe  them  on  to  any  thinge  for  y" 
Plantations  advancement:  since  as  the  whole  world  knowes,  the  late 
Companie  haue  not  only  allwayes  conceaved  extreamly  ill  of  them,  but 
in  the  yeare  1(323.  putt  vp  publiq3  accusacons  agaynst  them,  of  very  dan- 
gerous Consequence.  As  for  y''  Colony,  yo''  Lo'"  haue  formerly  heard  their 
like  opinions. 

Nor  cann  y""  late  Companie  conceaue,  M"'  Wrote,  a  fitt  Instrum'  to  sett 
forward  the  busines;  whome  they  though  vnworthy  to  bee  of  their  Societie. 
Nor  that  those  who  out  of  pretence  for  New-Englands  good,  haue  truly 
wronged  Virginia,  should  now  rumie  a  right  way  for  the  bchoofe  thereof. 

Nor  in  suiri,  that  those  who  haue  §little  or§  no  interest  in  y''  Plantation, 
should  be  so  sencible  of  it  as  were  fitt.  In  w"^  number  wee  accompte  S' 
Nathaniell  Rich;  whoe  to  our  knowledge  hath  not  aduentured  any  thinge 
for  the  good  thereof  but  contrary  wise  hath  been  so  p'pe  perpetuallie  a 
hinderer,  &  disturber  of  the  Action,  that  the  body  of  the  Company,  ad- 
dressed a  Peticon  of  Complainte,  to  the  last  Parliament,  crauinge  iustice 
against  him,  for  his  iniurious  &  most  vnworthy  practises.  [21]  Nor 
that  they  that  meane  not  to  adventure  any  thinge,  \\  ilhe  able  to  persuade 
others  to  doe  that  w''''  themsclues  forl^care. 

Nor  that  euer  the}'  will  do  y-  Adventurers  of  y'  late  Companie  right,  in 
matters  of  their  Estates;  that  haue  so  violently  endeavoured  to  do  them 
wrong  in  their  Ilono"  &  Reputacons:  hauing  intended  as  themselues  wright, 
a  Reformacon  &  Correction  of  the  Originall  Court  bookes  of  y''  l;it(>  Com- 
panie then  possessed  by  them,  if  they  could  haue  gott  into  their  hand^ 
certayne  copies  of  them  w^''  M'  Nicholas  Ferrar  late  Deputy  had  at  his 
owne  charges  caused  to  be  transcribed.  But  before  their  seucre  order  came 
to  him,  he  had  delivered  his  copys  to  the  Earlc  of  Southampton:  who  sent 
the  Comissioners  word,  that  he  would  as  soone  part  w"'  the  evidences  of 
his  Land,  as  w*^''  the  said  Copies;  being  the  evidence  of  his  honour  in  that

service:  so  by  this  meanes  liaue  the  Originall  Courtbookes  yet  escaped 
purging:  And  w""  all  duety  wee  humbly  beseech  yo'  Lo"',  that  they  may 
hereafter  be  protected  from  it:  And  that  howsoeuer  yo''  Lo""  shall  please 
for  the  future  to  dispose  of  the  Companie,  that  the  records  of  their  past 
Actions  may  not  be  corrupted  &  falsified. 

As  for  their  resolucons  of  orderinge  the  busines,  wee  cannot  say  any  thingo, 
because  wee  heare  nothinge,  and  wee  doubt  they  meane  nothinge.  For 
all  that  wee  heare  tends  only  to  nothing.  They  dislike  the  sending  of 
nombers  of  men.  They  professe  the  reducinge  of  all  tradinge  to  a  Joynt- 
stock  or  Magazine:  w"*"  courses  in  o''  iudgements  tend  directly  to  the 
subversion  of  the  Plantation,  at  least  to  y"  appropriatinge  of  it  to  them- 
selues  which  to  haue  bin  the  mayne  end  of  some  of  them,  y®  late  Counsell 
&  Companie  for  Virginia,  haue  vpon  strong  presumpcon  bin  long  agoe 
induced  to  belieue:  and  therefore  haue  now  thought  themselues  bound  to 
declare  it,  that  yo""  Lo"^  in  yo'  Noble  wisedomes  may  make  such  due  pre- 
vencon  as  shalbe  fitt:  humbly  beseechinge  that  this  perticuler  examinacon 
of  their  Actions  &  persons,  may  not  be  interpreted  to  proceed  from  private 
spleene,  but  only  from  a  sincere  desire  of  y""  Plantations  advancement. 

Wee  doubt  and  feare,  that  wee  haue  wearied  yo'  Lo^"  w*h  y"  large  relation 
of  the  proceedinges  of  these  men,  wee  meane  the  partie  opposite  to  the 
late  Companie  &  Colonie.  Whereby  as  they  haue  laid  all  kind  of  Dis- 
reputacon  vpon  the  Action,  and  made  that  in  y^  estimaeon  [22]  of  the 
world  vilde  &  contemptible,  w"*"  before  was  held  worthy,  beneficial!,  & 
honourable:  so  by  their  manifold  &  incessant  practises,  to  wrong  & 
oppresse,  to  defame  &  disgrace,  by  vniust  &  vnworthy  aspersions  & 
contumelies,  (&  that  byword  &  writing  ouer  all  y"  kingdome)  the  innocency 
of  men  zealous  for  the  good  of  Virginia,  for  no  other  fault  saue  only  for 
their  love  of  right  &  iustice;  they  haue  bredd  a  great  disheartninge  & 
discouragem'  of  many  the  most  forward  &  most  constant  Adventurers, 
whose  industry  also  &  labours  have  bin  of  great  vse  to  y"  Plantation. 
All  w"*"  being  wearied  out  w""  their  mallice  and  iniuries,  and  loath  to  spend 
more  of  their  lives  in  so  vnthankfuU  a  service,  are  humble  suitors  vnto 
yo'  LoP^  that  they  may  be  spared  from  all  farther  employment  in  this 
Action.  And  that  if  these  men  will  now  at  length  apply  themselues 
seriously  to  y"  busines  of  of  y''  Colonie,  both  w"'  their  paynes  &  purses, 


544  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINLi  COMPANY 

w"'^  they  haue  hitherto  spared,  and  vndertake  (w"''  they  owe  to  his  IMa*'* 
&  y''  State)  the  repairinge  those  ruynes  of  the  Plantation,  whereof  they 
haue  bin  the  chief e  cause  and  instruments:  the  Governement  thereof  may, 
as  it  is,  be  continued  in  them,  giving  fitt  securitie  for  so  great  a  debt  & 
duty.  For  wee  protest  vnto  yo'  Lo^",  vpon  our  truth  &  fidehtie,  that  if 
his  Ma**'  may  be  served,  the  Colony  secured  &  cherished,  iustice  duly 
administred,  mens  rights  &  states  preserved,  innocent  men  not  oppressed, 
and  malefactors  not  protected  &  rewarded;  wee  shalbe  so  farr  from 
envying  the  glory  of  their  Governement,  that  extinguishing  for  euer  the 
memory  of  all  their  former  iniuries,  wee  wilbe  ready  to  doe  them  all  fitt 
service  that  they  shall  require. 

By  this  w''^  hath  bin  said,  yo'  Lo'^"  will  easily  perceaue,  that  obedience  to 
yo''  comaund^,  and  a  desire  that  y^  Plantation  (if  possibly)  may  yet 
subsist,  is  y''  end  of  o'  labour:  not  that  wee  intend,  or  haue  any  enclinaron, 
to  encomber  our  selues,  w*''  a  busines  so  vexed  &  perplexed;  but  only 
ayme  at  what  may  bee  to  the  good  of  it,  though  to  o""  owne  trouble.  But 
if  yo''  Lqp"  in  yo'  wisedomes,  shall  not  thinke  it  fitt  to  putt  it  into  their 
handes:  or  that  they,  w""  such  caution  as  may  be  reasonably  desired,  shall 
not  adventure  to  vndertake  it:  Wee  then  will  notwithstandinge,  in  expres- 
sion of  o''  duty  to  his  Ma'*'  and  the  State,  in  respect  of  our  ancient  &  present 
love  to  y^  Plantation,  and  for  the  speciall  benefitt  that  may  succeed  to 
this  Kingdome  by  such  a  place  of  securitie  &  retreate  in  America;  (the 
wont  [23]  whereof,  as  by  experience  in  many  particulars  may  be  demon- 
strated, was  in  the  late  Queenes  tyme  the  overthrowe  of  most  of  o'  voyages 
sett  out  for  the  West  Indies)  for  these  reasons  wee  say,  wee  shall  endcauour 
o''  best,  but  dare  not  vndertake,  to  restore  what  these  others  haue  ni 
allmost  destroyed.  But  yet  that,  vpon  such  condicons,  as  wee  hold  most 
necessary  for  the  effecting  of  so  great  a  worke,  that  is,  some  impediments 
to  bee  removed,  &  some  encouragements  to  be  given  to  it. 

It  hath  bin  a  great  errour,  for  any  to  imagine,  that  the  persons  of  these 
men,  who  haue  of  late  thus  opposed  the  Companie,  were  either  in  nomber 
considerable,  or  in  adventure  to  be  valued  any  way  at  all,  to  further  or 
advance  the  prosperity  of  the  Plantation:  but  rather  on  the  contrary, 
great  impediments  to  the  faire  proceeding  of  it:  And  therefore  whereas 
the  late  Companie,  haue  by  the  vniust  practises  of  divers  of  these,  and 


APRIL  (.?),  1625  545 

some  of  them  vnworthy  persons,  suffered  so  much  in  the  reputacon  of 
their  persons  &  actions,  aswell  by  private  calumny,  as  also  in  some  publiq3 
proceedings  agaynst  them:  Wee  shall  for  that  cause  most  humbly  desire, 
that  y"  Actions  &  passages  of  o''  late  Governem*,  may  be  brought  to  an 
vpright  examinacon,  before  this  Hono'''''  Board:  and  that  being  found,  as 
wee  assure  ourselues  they  will,  to  haue  bin  most  iust,  &  euer  tending  to 
y^  Plantations  advancement,  wee  may  then  haue  iust  repara(3on  from 
those,  by  whome  wee  &  the  Plantation  it  selfe  haue  bin  so  much  wronged: 
That  the  like  dangers  may  be  hereafter  prevented,  by  discouraging  others 
from  the  same  attempts;  and  that  wee  the  late  Company,  lieing  restored 
to  the  integritie  of  o"'  reputaeons,  may  bee  the  better  enabled  to  goe  on 
^th  ye  Action,  for  y"  tyme  to  come. 

Nowe  in  reguard  of  the  extreame  distresse  &  poverty,  that  by  these  late 
practises  of  y""  Colony  is  reduced  vnto;  and  by  reason  of  y'"  disability,  & 
vnwillingnesse  of  Adventurers,  being  so  extreamely  discouraged,  and  who 
haue  allready  wasted  a  great  part  of  their  tyme,  and  no  small  part  of  their 
estates,  in  supportinge  this  Plantation:  as  also  in  reguard  of  the  great  danger 
that  may  be  feared  from  a  forraigne  enemy:  Wee  shall  most  humbly  desire, 
that  his  Ma''''  would  be  pleased,  to  yield  vnto  the  Plantation,  some  such 
moderate  supply,  as  after  the  late  Massacre  was  promised  in  the  last  Kings 
tyme;  Namely,  the  settinge  out  of  Foure  hundred  able  men,  at  the  vol- 
untary charges  of  the  seuerall  shiers  of  this  Kingdome,  proportionably  to 
be  rated.  And  besides  for  y^  present  [24]  pressing  necessitie,  to  give  vs 
some  such  reasonable  proportion  of  Munition  &  Powder,  as  in  reguard  of 
these  tymes  may  be  thought  convenient. 

These  difficulties  &  impediments  being  eased  or  removed,  wee  come  now  in 
the  last  place  to  present  our  humble  opinions,  touching  the  best  forme  of 
Governement  to  be  here  established  for  Virginia;  wherein  wee  humbly 
offer  to  yo'  Lo^^*  consideracon,  whether  it  may  not  seeme  requisite,  that  a 
Companie  be  agayne  erected  of  Adventurers  &  Planters  for  the  governinge 
&  menaginge  of  the  affaires  of  that  Plantation.  In  the  waginge  whereof, 
wee  haue  divided  our  thoughts  into  these  three  branches: 

If  his  Ma'""  should  be  pleased  himselfe  to  vndertake  the  Plantation,  and 
the  charge  thereof  to  be  defrayed  out  of  his  Royall  Treasure;  or  otherwise 
at  the  Generall  charge  of  the  Kingdome:  Wee  hold  it  out  of  question,  that 


546  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMPANY 

the  fittest  Governement  of  the  Action,  were  by  a  select  Counsell  of  Hono'^''' 
&  able  persons,  to  be  ordayned  and  appoynted  by  his  i\Ia''%  as  is  vsed  in 
like  cases  in  some  forrayne  Dominions. 

But  if  the  burden  &  charge  must  be  borne  by  the  Adventurers  and  Planters 
themselues:  Wee  hold  it  necessary  in  that  case,  that  y"  Governm*  thereof 
be  also  comended  by  his  Ma*^  to  them,  incorporated  as  before  into  a 
Legall  Companie:  yet  so,  as  to  be  assisted  &  advised  by  a  Councell  to  be 
appoynted  by  his  Ma'^  &  bound  by  oath  vnto  him;  and  they  also  to  haue 
refference  in  all  causes  of  greatest  &  extraordinary  importance,  to  his  ]Ma"^ 
himself e,  or  to  the  Lords  of  this  privy  Counsell,  from  thence  to  take 
resolucon  &  direction,  as  was  formerly  instituted,  and  in  the  latter  times 
also  practised.  And  this  is  agreeable  to  y"  coiTion  vsage  of  the  world,  & 
in  perticuler  of  this  Nation:  experience  having  manifested,  that  men  are 
difficultly  drawne  to  adventure  any  great  matter  in  these  Actions,  in  y* 
ordering  of  w"*"  they  haue  no  voice  or  interest. 

For  as  for  this  late  third  way  of  Governement,  by  an  absolute  Comission, 
disprovided  of  other  meanes,  saue  what  should  be  raysed  from  y''  Plan- 
taron  experience  hath  taught,  that  it  cann  worke  no  great  effect,  the  hearts 
of  all  the  Adventurers  being  turned  away  from  the  Action,  &  y''  Plant" 
there  in  great  part,  vpon  the  bare  feare  &  forerunning  rumour  of  this 
Comission,  resolving  to  come  away  &  desert  the  Plantation.  Howbeit  if 
such  of  y'^  Comissione"  themselues,  as  formerly  enioyed  or  partaked,  & 
now  affected  this  Governement,  would  haue  opened  their  owne  purses,  as 
was  promised  to  his  late  Ma'^,  for  the  support  of  the  Plantation;  [25]  it 
might  perhaps  haue  bin  continued  on  for  some  longer  tyme:  Whereas  now 
all  men  avoiding  to  adventure  vnder  them,  &  they  not  disposed  to  give 
example  in  that  kind,  but  rather  to  agitate  and  frame  Contracts,  whereby 
themselues  might  growe  rich,  though  w*''  the  penury  &  consumption  of 
the  Generall  Plantacon:  the  Colonic  there  doth  wast  by  hasty  Degrees, 
and  will  suddaynly  come  to  nothing  if  speedy,  remedy  be  not  provided. 

Now  if  yo'  LoP'  shall  thinke  good  to  approve  of  o'  humble  opinion,  (w'='' 
wee  in  all  duty  submitt  vnto  yo'  Lo^'  maturer  iudgements,)  and  that  y^ 
Companie  be  reerected  by  his  Ma*^  Lres  Pattents  &  vnder  his  great  seale, 
as  it  formerly  was:  then  doe  wee  further  presume  to  offer  vnto  yo''  Lo"' 
consideraron,  these  few  perticulers  here  ensuinge. 


APRIL  {?),  1625  547 

First  wee  hold  it  requisite,  that  this  new  Pattent  should  contayne  y" 
same  priviledges  &  Libties,  the  like  orders  &  directions,  as  were  in  the 
former:  yet  w"'  this,  that  if  there  appeare  in  y"  former  graunts,  any  tliinge 
inconvenient,  as  preiudiciall  to  his  Ma*'',  it  be  reformed : 

Secondly,  in  reguard  y"  Colonie,  taking  all  ill  pleight  at  y°  beginning,  doth 
still  runne  eftly-  §on§  in  plying  only  Tobacco,  notw^^'standing  y'^  great 
charges  w"*"  the  Companie  was  at,  in  the  tyme  of  the  latter  Governement, 
for  y°  setting  vp  of  better  Comodities,  as  Silke,  Wynes,  Iron,  materialls  for 
shipping,  and  others:  that  his  Ma''"  would  be  graciously  pleased,  con- 
tinuing the  Custome  vpon  Tobacco,  to  remitt  the  custome  of  all  other  com- 
odities for  certen  yeares;  W''  wee  suppose  would  be  a  matter  of  very  small 
losse  to  his  Ma"'',  aboundantly  to  be  recompenced  in  y"  yeares  ensuinge; 
and  yet  a  great  meanes  to  drawe  the  Colony  to  those  better  courses,  w'^'' 
no  orders  of  the  Companie  could  yet  euer  effect:  And  likewise,  that  y"* 
Custom"  be  restrayned  from  extorting  Custome  of  goods  transported 
thither  for  mens  perticuler  provisions,  &  not  by  way  of  Merchandize,  as 
the  Law  requires. 

Thirdly,  that  in  this  Pattent  there  be  declared  a  nullitie  of  all  tlie  proceed- 
ings of  the  late  Comissioners ;  having  bin  vpon  iust  caase  soe  extreamly 
distastfuU  both  to  the  Adventurers  &  Planters. 

Fourthly  &  lastly  it  is  desired,  that  his  Ma"*'  would  be  graciously  pleased 
that  this  new  Pattent  be  confirmed  by  Act  of  Parliam',  if  y''  Lords  & 
Comons  w^'all  so  thinke  fitt.  And  this  wee  hold  requisite  for  two 
important  reasons: 

First  wee  suppose  it  will  greatly  encourage  the  Adventure'^  &  Planters, 
[26]  by  giving  them  assurance  of  y"  continuance  of  this  Plantacon,  and  of 
their  seuerall  estates  &  possessions  in  y'^  same:  the  iealousy  w'^''  hath  bin 
bred  by  the  late  Quo  warranto,  being  not  otherwise  possibly  to  be  removed. 
And  this  encouragem*  would  be  greatly  encreased,  if  by  his  Ma*^^  Royall 
authoritie,  w""  consent  of  Parliament,  bothe  Plantacons  might  be  annexed 
to  y"  Imperiall  Crowne  of  this  Realme,  according  vnto  y^  comendable 
pollicie  of  some  other  great  Kingdoms. 

Secondly  by  meanes  of  this  Act,  the  New  Company  may  be  inabled  to 
recover  y"  Debts  due  to  y"  former  Company,  either  vpon  Accompt  or 


548  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGINIA  COMl'A.W 

otherwise ;  as  also  to  haiie  restitucon  by  a  legall  course  for  the  great  depre- 
dacons  done  vpon  y""  Colonie.  A  matter  tending  greatly  to  the  support  of 
y"  Plantation,  as  also  to  y"  reestablishing  of  y*"  good  Governem'  of  y*"  same. 
And  this  is  our  humble  answeare  vnto  your  Lo*"  first  proposicon. 

[half  a  page  blank] 

[27]  For  the  second  Consideracon,  lefte  vnto  vs  by  yo'  Lor"''',  namely  con- 
cerning an  offer  to  be  made,  for  such  a  Contract  towchinge  Tobacco,  w"'  his 
Ma''%  as  may  both  vphould  his  former  Revenue,  and  not  bee  greuious  to 
the  Plantations,  wee  say  thus. 

That  vnles  in  yo'  lor'''''  wisdome§s§  those  Condicons  by  vs  formerly 
propounded  bee  yeilded  vnto,  wee  cannot  treate  of  this  buissines;  for  wee 
come  not  as  Contractors  to  make  a  bargaine  for  our  owne  priuate  lucre,  but 
w"'  an  ey[e]  only  to  the  publique  benifitt  of  the  Plantations,  as  farr  as  it 
may  be  without  preiudice  of  his  Ma*-^  proffitt;  w"'out  any  reseruation  of 
secrettC,  as  in  the  last  Contract  were  pretended:  For  in  a  publique  bargaine, 
betwkt  his  Ma*'''  and  his  people,  the  most  cleere,  publique,  &  direct  pro- 
ceedingC  will  euer  receiue  the  best  interpretation. 

Wee  cannot  in  our  vnderstandingC  conceiue,  that  any  proffer  though  neuer 
soe  greate,  cann  be  for  his  Ma'""'  aduantadge,  but  rather  the  contrary,  if  it 
so  presse  vppon  the  Plantation,  that  the  Planter  shall  not  be  able  to  liue 
with  comfort  by  his  labour:  And  so  others  be  discouradged,  from  further 
proceeding^.  A  greate  reuenue  peradventu[rc]  maye  be  raysed  for  a  yeare 
or  two,  but  if  the  Plantation  decaye  the  revenue  cannot  last:  And  thus  it 
had  beene,  if  the  last  Contract  had  gon  on;  though  the  immense  gayne  had 
come  to  the  Contractors  themselu[es]  &  not  to  his  Ma''^ 

But  now  for  ourselues,  it  is  true  A  Contract  was  formerly  treated  of  betwixt 
the  Company,  and  the  Earle  of  Middlesex,  but  as  hath  been  before  read 
vnto  yo'  LorPP'  though  it  were  then  extreame  hard,  yett  it  is  nowe  impos- 
sible, by  reason  of  the  worse  case  the  Plantation  stand?  in  nowe,  then  it 
did  then,  principally  occasioned  by  the  discouradgement?  giuen  to  the 
Company. 

Wee  acknowledge  vnto  yo'  lorP"',  that  the  bestowinge  banishinge  of  all 
Spanish  Tobacco,  will  much  redound  to  the  Plantations  benifitt,  and  his 


APRIL  (?),  1625  549 

Ma''^  losse:  but  withall,  wee  conceaue  that  if  there  were  no  Tobacco  in 
neither  of  thei[.s]  Plantations,  itt  were  better  for  his  Ma*^  to  loose  seauen  or 
eight  thousanffZ]  Pound  a  yeare  Custome  by  the  not  importation  of  Spanish 
Tobacco,  the[?i]  to  hinder  the  importation  of  100000"  a  yeare  in  money, 
w*""  this  Comodit[?/]  did,  as  was  cleerely  manifested  to  the  two  last 
Parliaments. 

[28]  Howsoeuer,  wee  intend  not  vppon  the  Condicons  in  the  former  paper 
mentioned;  to  make  a  meane  &  contemptible  offer  to  his  Ma"''  but  such  a 
one,  as  wee  conceiue  in  truth,  for  the  Kings  profiitt,  to  befall  as  large,  & 
more  certayne  then  this  last;  and  more  then  at  any  tyme  really  came  int(j 
the  Exchequar  by  this  Comoditie.  Profferinge  soe  much,  as  wee  thinck 
the  Plantacons  can  possibly  beare  &  subsist;  and  goinge  as  high  nowe  at 
first,  §as§  we  shall  euer  be  drawne  to  yeild  vnto.  And  doubt  not,  but  that 
yeildinge  vnto  his  Ma'^'  after  the  first  yeare,  10000"  certayne,  and  3000"  a 
yeare  more  by  Custome,  in  all  13000"  per  Annu9,  it  will  be  thought  more 
then  sufficient  from  these  nowe  languishinge  Plantations.  For  in  this 
bargaine  the  Summer  IlandC  as  well  as  Virginia  are  vnderstood  to  be  com- 
prehended. And  so  wee  are  confident,  that  wee  haue  given  yo'  LorP""  full 
satisfaction,  to  this  second  proposition,  namely,  concerninge  the  offer  for 
such  A  Contract  to  be  made  w*''  his  Ma"''  towchinge  Tobacco,  as  maye 
both  vphould  his  former  reuenue,  and  not  be  greiuous  to  the  Plantations. 
The  perticulers  foUowe. 

That  the  sole  Importation  of  Tobacco,  into  the  Realmes  of  England,  and 
Ireland,  be  graunted  by  his  Ma*^  Letters  Pattents  vndcr  his  greate  Scale, 
to  the  Companies  for  Virginia  &  the  Suiner  Islands. 

That  his  Ma''*",  by  Proclamation  inhibite  all  others,  vnder  payne  of  con- 
fiscation of  their  Tobacco,  and  his  Ma*^  highe  displeasure. 

That  hkewise  the  plantinge  of  Tobacco  in  England  and  Ireland,  be  for- 
bidden by  the  saide  Proclamation  vnder  a  greiuous  penalty. 

In  Consideracon  whereof,  the  Aduenturers,  &  Planters  of  both  Collonies, 
wilbe  content,  that  a  fourth  parte  of  their  Tobaccoes  (w''*'  shall  yearely 
come  home)  shalbe  sett  aside  &  sould  for  publique  vses,  and  out  of  y^ 
proceed  thereof  shalbe 


550  RECORDS  OF  THE  VIRGIXIA  COMPANY 

First  payd  &  dischardged  the  Custome,  due  vppon  the  whole  Quantitie 
(w'^^  shalbe  brought  home,)  w'^''  Custome,  shalbe  after  the  rate  of  iijd 
p  pound,  as  nowe  it  is  rated  and  wilbe  y"  full  Custome  that  can  be  requyred, 
although  the  Tobacco  should  be  sould  after  the  rate  of  6'  p  pound. 

[29]  Secondly  out  of  the  §proceed§  of  the  saide  fourth  parte,  there  shalbe 
farther  yearely  payd  vnto  hi[.s]  Ma*^'  by  wayc  of  thanckfuU  retribution  for 
his  gratious  fauo"'s — 10000  ''. 

The  whole  remaynder  of  the  proceed  of  this  fowrth  parte  of  Tobacco, 
shalb[e]  First,  for  the  defrayinge  of  the  chardges  of  menadginge  and 
ordringe  this  Contract.  Accordinge  as  the  Company  shall  thinck  good 
to  proportion  itt. 

And  the  Surplus,  whateuer  it  bee  shalbe  bestowed  (in  such  manner  as  the 
Companies  shall  finde  most  fitt)  for  the  supporte  &  aduancemcnt  of  the 
Plantations. 

And  because  it  is  doubted,  that  in  regard  of  many  difficulties,  w'^''  are 
allwaies  in  the  settlinge  of  newe  buissinesses,  the  proceed  of  the  fourth 
parte,  for  y'^  first  yeare,  may  not  amount  to  soe  much  as  the  proporcons 
aboue.  Itt  is  therefore  desired,  that  for  y"  first  yeare  his  Ma*'°  would  be 
gratiously  pleased  to  allowe  out  of  y"  proceed  of  y"  saide  fourth  pa§r§t[e] 

First,  as  much  as  shall  defraye  the  Custome,  then  6000'"  more  towards 
the  vscs  aboue  expressed,  and  then  to  accept  of  the  remaynder  that  shalbe, 
although  it  should  proue  10000".  But  in  case  it  should  proue  more  his 
Mil"''  to  haue  only  10000"  and  y*"  rest  to  be  bestowed  as  is  afore  expressed. 

That  the  Tobacco  to  be  brought  in  be  consigned  in  one  hand,  viz'  of  such 
officers  as  y"  saide  Company  shall  appoynt.  And  that  the  saide  Company 
haue  the  sole  mcnadging  of  the  saide  sale  of  Tobaccoe. 

That  the  Aduenturers  of  each  Plantation  shall  not  be  bound  to  bringe  in 
any  greate[r]  Quantities  of  Tobacco  then  thcmselues  shall  thinck  good. 

It  is  lykewise  desired,  that  for  recouery  of  all  such  debt?  as  shall  from  tyme 
to  tyme  growe  due  to  y''  Companies  by  occasion  of  this  Contract,  the  saide 
debt?  may  be  assigned  ouer  vnto  the  kinge,  when  &  soe  often  as  need 
shall  require. 


MAY,  1625  551 

They  likewise  desire  that  there  maye  be  inserted  in  the  Contract,  a  Graunt 
&  Couenaunte  from  his  Ma""  against  the  grauntinge  of  lycences  to  Retay- 
lers  of  Tobacco:  Soe  that  y"  Sale  thereof  may  remayne  free  as  hetherto  it 
hath  done. 

That  his  Ma*'"  be  pleased  to  take  a  strickt  course  for  the  preuenting  of  all 
vndue  bringinge  in  of  Tobacco  by  other  meanes. 

That  all  confiscations  and  other  penalties  vppon  this  Contract  be  deuided 
into  three  part^.  The  one  parte  to  his  Mat"  vse,  the  other  to  y^  Com- 
panies, the  third  to  the  Informers.

towardes  the  supportance  of  his  Charges  in  the  sohcytinge  of  theire

that  he  would  receiue  the  money  by  parcels  as  he  should  haue  occasione 
to  vse  it,  and  render  an  accoumpt  of  his  disbursments,  and  to  restore  the 
remander,  now  Since  no  money  was  expended,  and  our  suite  not  psecuted, 
by  resone  of  his  death  at  his  first  arival  vppon  the  Coaste,  The  Country 
humbly  by  us  solicyte  your  Lorpps,  that  they  not  both  lose  theire  cause 
and  theire  Charges,  But  that  you  woulde  be  pleased  out  of  your  Lorpps 
accustomed  equitie  to  take  such  order,  That  Sr.  Thomas  merry  his  suite 
may  not  pceede  to  the  pervertinge  of  the  intentione  of  theire  gifte,  and  the 
equitie  of  the  cause  itselfe,  To  w"''  we  doupt  not  y*  he  beinge  soe  worthie  a 
gentleman,  will  willinghe  condiscende.  We  haue  further  to  acquant  your 
Lorpps  that  his  ma""'  Comissioners  for  the  affayers  of  Virginia  haue  written 
vnto  us  to  send  home  the  Tobacco  levied  for  the  discharge  of  the  two 
hundred  powndes  yf  it  had  been  paide  &  consigne  it  to  them,  W"^  we 
desire  wee  may  nott  be  forced  vnto,  beinge  more  grevious  then  y"  former, 
seinge  those  good?,  the  money  not  beinge  paide,  is  theire  owne  that  gave  it. 

Wheras  Capt  John  martin  formerly  recomendcd  by  you"'  Lorpps.  and  lately 
nominated  by  his  ma''"''  Comissioners  to  be  one  of  his  Counsell  in  Virginia, 
hath  proved  him  selfe  altogether  vnwoorthie  of  either,  as  is  evident,  yf 
your  Lorpps  shalbe  pleased  to  pervse  them,  by  many  depositions  and  other 
pticulcrs,  in  so  much  as  we  haue  benn  forced  owt  of  y°  service  W^  we  owe 
to  his  ma*'°  &  this  Countrey,  to  suspende  him  from  the  Executione  of  his 
place,  wherin  we  proceeded  accordinge  to  the  awthoritie  formerly  given, 
And  ratified  by  his  ma*'"^  Comissione,  and  the  Comissioners  order.  To 
whom  we  affoorded  all  respect  and  favor,  not  w'^'standinge  his  many 
delinquencies  from  his  first  entrance  into  the  lande,  vntill  they  grew  to 
soe  great  an  excess  as  was  dangerous  to  his  Ma""  service,  and  extreamely 
preiudicyall  to  the  Colony,  and  we  humblie  desire  that  this  may  be  accepted 
as  our  iuste  excuse. 

We  haue  vnderstood  from  one  of  his  ma''™  Comissioners  for  Virginia,  that 
his  ma""  is  highlie  incensed  against  us  for  punishinge  one  Edwarde  shariiles, 
who  beinge  farr  aboue  his  qualitie  and  condicione  after  the  death  of  m' 
Secretarye,  into  whose  service  at  his  erncst  request,  he  was  first  receaued,

JUNE  15,  1625  561 

copies  of  our  wrightings  w*''owt  leaue  from  the  Goucnnor,  He  contrary  to 
his  oath  and  dwtie,  had  vppon  a  secrett  practice,  dehvered  our  papers  w'''' 
greatly  concernde  us,  comitted  to  his  charge,  for  w"''  his  perfidiousnes  and 
periurie,  he  was  sett  one  the  Pillory  and  lost  a  peece  of  one  of  his  eares, 
though  his  sentance  was  to  lose  them  bothe,  w'^''  hath  been  so  misreported 
&  aggravated  to  his  Ma*'%  as  other  things  also  hath  benn,  as  a  bloudie  and 
barbarous  Acte,  and  we  threatned  w""  such  fowle  and  iniouryous  tearmes 
as  yf  we  were  below  the  Conditione  of  ffreemen,  We  humblie  desire  Your 
Lorpps  that  we  may  not  tread  as  vppon  thornes,  in  all  our  accons  through 
the  malice  of  our  traducers,  nor  be  subiect  to  theire  violent  insulting^. 

Lastlie  we  are  humblie  to  offer  to  Your  Lorpps  consideratione  the  desperate 
estate  of  this  Colony,  by  the  late  pnitious  contract  w''^  hath  diverted  his 
j^g^ties  royall  intentions  and  bountie  to  this  Colony  in  grauntinge  us  the 
sole  importacione  of  Tobacco,  (w''''  well  ordered,  would  certaincly  and 
suddenly  advaunce  the  Plantacione,  by  the  presente  inhablinge  us  for 
woorkes  of  woorth  and  continuance,  but  by  convertinge  the  benefitt  thcrof 
to  theire  privatt  and  inordinate  lucre,  hath  giuen  the  Colony  the  greatest 
blowe  that  euer  it  receaued.  And  w'howt  spedie  redress,  will  proue  incur- 
able, and  cause  this  noble  and  hopefull  Accone  to  be  deserted,  The 
effects  wherof  begin  to  disclose  themselues  in  our  scante  &  miserable 
supplies,  at  moste  inconscyonable  rates,  and  in  the  generall  discoragement 
of  the  whole  Colony,  And  we  may  not  be  silent,  that  some  whom  his  ma*'" 
hath  appoynted  Comissioners  for  those  affayres,  are  contriuers  &  favorers 
of  this  Contract,  [14a]  Contrary  to  theire  duties  and  the  trust  ymposed 
vppon  them  by  his  ma*'",  and  some  of  them  alredie  by  theire  divininge 
and  tryumphinge  vppon  those  miserable  wantes  that  we  are  alredie  falen 
into,  shew  they  well  enoughe  vnderstande  the  inevitable  pnitious  conse- 
quences of  the  Contract,  w'^''  will,  as  they  say,  make  us  rather  to  be  pittied 
then  expostulated  w**"  all.  Besides  the  malitious  designs  w"""  are  now  in 
plottinge  and  Contrivinge  to  overthrow  his  ma*'*'^  publique  ministers,  who 
haue  discharged  theire  Conscyences  in  his  ma*"''^  service  w*''  all  integretie 
and  fidelitie.  And  we  no  longer  desire  his  ma*'"^  favor,  w'^''  is  more  then  life 
vnto  us,  then  theire  intentions  shall  appere  to  tende  to  the  destructione, 
And  our  endeavors  to  the  upholdinge  and  advancment  of  the  Colony. 
Thus  humbly  desiringe  you'  Lorpps  to  take  our  innocence  into  you'' 
Honor*^  patronage,  and  that  accordinge  to  the  Coustomc  of  the  former

We  haue  had  many  royall  assurances  of  his  ma*''''  greate  care  and  favor  to 
this  Plantatione  &  we  returne  our  humblest  thanks  vnto  his  Highness, 
y'  (not  w*hstandinge  the  revokinge  the  former  Pattent)  he  hath  gratiously 
pmised,  not  only  to  confirme,  but  to  enlarge  w*^  ample  priveleges  y""  private 
interests  of  Adventurers  &  Planters. 

It  is  trew  there  hath  been  a  late  decrease  in  y"  progress  of  Adventures  and 
supphes  sent  hither,  butt  in  other  respects  y*'  Colonic  was  in  a  hopefull 
waye  &  in  as  good  a  Conditione  as  ever,  howsoever  his  ma*'''  hath  benn 
informed  the  Contrarye  as  appeers  by  your  Lf  es  to  our  noe  smale  preiudice. 

We  haue  to  our  vtmoste  habileties  endevered  to  discharge  that  trust 
imposed  vppon  us  by  his  ma*'''  in  his  late  Comissione,  but  we  hope  that 
we  shalbe  shortlie  eased  of  this  burthen,  y°  Comissione  beinge  only  for 
the  present,  in  pticuler,  Sr:  Francis  wyatt  doth  render  all  humble  thankes

It  is  no  new  thinge  to  us  to  be  wTonged  by  the  defamatione  of  malitious

at  the  fynell  conclusione  of  that  busines,  and  coulde  haue  certified  the 
Contrarie. 

We  had  by  the  laste  shippe  sente  a  generall  muster  wherof  we  now  sende 
you  a  copie  w*''  additions  of  the  distances  of  the  severall  Plantationes, 
How  they  haue  been  since  awgmented,  you  shall  know  Ijy  the  next  generall

Compeny,  and  w*  belong^  to  y"  Offices  stated  by  the  Compeny,  as  farr  as 
we  coulde  learne  by  oath  or  otherwyse. 

Concerninge  the  depts  and  the  moytie  of  the  labors  of  the  Compenys 
Tenants,  m""  George  Sandys  now  returned  hath  brought  into  us  an  ac- 
coumpte, w"''  we  heerewith  send  you. 

That  transactione  made  by  the  Compenye  to  the  Gouerner  and  m""  George 
Sandys  was  in  pte  of  Satisfactione  of  theire  pmised  meanes,  a  dwe  dept, 
and  not  a  gifte.  And  to  haue  it  wrested  from  them,  vppon  the  revokinge  of 
y"  Pattent,  we  accoumpte  it  a  greate  oppressione  consideringe  his  ma'"" 
gracyous  pmise  of  preservinge  y®  pticuler  interest  of  every  man,  other 
alienatione  we  know  nott  of. 

We  hope  y'  no  man  doupts  but  y'  it  was  necessarie  to  enioyne  y"  Planters  to

pownde  of  Tol^acco  was  also  a  volutary  gift  of  y*"  Couutrey,  and  y"  charges 
allowed  uery  necessary,  nether  could  it  be  expected,  consideringe  our 
troubles,  but  y'  they  should  haue  been  much  greater,  Howsoeuer  y"  Cla[m]or 
of  some  suborned  calumniato"  may  haue  moved  you  to  cale  it  a  pretext, 
And  we  hope  that  y^  free  Acts  of  the  Countrey  shall  not  be  farther  ques- 
tioned to  the  preiudice  of  any  man.  The  accompts  therof  as  much  as 
haue  benn  receaued  we  haue  heerw*''  returned. 

The  fower  pownde  of  Tobacco  p  pole  was  given  by  y*  Countrey  to  m' 
Powntis  Conditionally  y'  he  receaved  the  money  and  solicyted  y"  cause  of 
the  Countrey,  w'^''  faylinge,  the  Countrey  conceives  y'  it  must  in  iustice  and 
equitie  retourne  to  themselves,  as  y"  trwe  pprietors  thereof.  Besides  as  we 
vnderstande,  there  is  like  to  be  suite  about  y"  recovery  of  the  two  hundred 
pownde  by  nV  Pountis  his  Executo',  w'^''  although  we  doupt  not,  when 
the  case  shalbe  trwUe  knowne,  will  appeere  to  haue  no  Couller  of  law  or 
conscyence,  yett  in  the  meane  tyme  it  is  necessary  y*  y^  saide  Tobacco 
should  remane  as  a  securitie  to  those  y*  stande  engaged,  w''''  is  y"  generall 
desire  &  resolution  of  y''  Countrey. 

The  marchante  was  never  enforced  to  take  Tobacco  at  three  shillings  the 
pownde  nor  did  they  allow  us  aboue  twelue  pence  a  pownde  at  the  moste  as 
the  Comodities  were  worthe  in  Englande,  Butt  we  fowTide  it  absolutlie 
necessarie  to  sett  some  bounde  [t]o  the  sea  of  theire  Covetousnes,  that 
would  else  haue  overwhellmed  all,  although  the  penal tye  of  theire  daylie

The  oath  hath  been  Administred  to  those  nominated  in  his  Ma""''  Comis-

Capt.  John  martin  from  the  exercise  of  his  place,  a  man  of  a  prostituted

as  the  tyme  of  preparatione  for  Cuttinge  downe  the  Salvages  Corne  was

of  w'^'"  they  are  infinitlye  desirous  wherby  it  is  probable,  that  they  will 
plant  great  quantities  of  corne  in  knowne  places,  soe  as  yf  suplyes  of

About  the  middle  of  July  last  arived  Capt  Jones  in  a  Spanish  ffriggott  w'^''

theire  first  examinations,  of  mutyneis  &  disorders  comitted  by  Joanes  and 
some  of  his  Compeny  against  Capt  Powell,  of  w'=^  perhaps  we  may  haue 
more  light  from  England  or  the  lowe  Countreys,  accordinge  to  w'''',  we 
may  the  better  know  how  to  pceed,  since  we  conceave  the  substance  of 
theire  ActC  against  the  Spaniards  are  not  now  to  strictlie  to  be  questioned. 
They  brought  in  w""  them  for  theire  Pilott  owt  of  the  Gulfe  (wherin  they 
had  loste  them  selves  divers  monethes)  a  Portugall,  who  seemes  to  be

how  to  dispose  of  him  we  know  nott  till  we  heere  from  you.

The  23""  of  march  arived  the  good  shipp  the  Virgen  of  Southamptone  w*'' 
Lfes  from  your  Lopps  of  the  24"»  of  October  laste,  Wherby  we  vnderstande 
his  Ma''^^  royall  care  of  this  Plantation,  as  well  in  present  supplie  of  our 
wants,  as  in  takinge  order  for  the  full  and  pfect  setUnge  of  y"  affayrs 
therof.  To  the  greate  encoragement  of  the  whole  Colony,  She  brings  us  an 
ernest  of  those  larger  supphes  gratiouslie  pmised  by  Ma''^  in  Comodities 
though  in  pportione  not  answerable  to  our  great  want?  yett  all  very  vsef uU 
and  well  conditioned,  for  w'^''  we  must  acknowledge  our  great  bonde  to 
you"  Lopps  &  in  pticuler  to  our  singular  good  lorde  The  Lor  Highe  Threaf. 

We  must  ever  acknowledge  it  a  singuler  favor  from  his  ma''",  That  he  hath 
been  pleased  to  remitt  the  ympositione  vppon  Tobacco  in  Consideratione 
of  supplyinge  of  the  Colony  and  we  humbly  desire  y'  your  Lopps  wilbe 
pleased  to  take  order,  that  it  may  be  aswell  pformed  one  theu-e  ptes  as 
pmised,  since  we  vnderstande  not  as  yett  of  any  shipp  sett  owt  by  them. 
Except  it  should  be  the  William  &  John,  w"*"  is  a  smale  shipp,  and  her 
course  by  the  west  indies,  As  the  tymes  are,  full  of  hazarde,  and  makes 
our  supphe  by  her,  very  vncertaine,  neither  can  it  be  greate,  as  well  in 
respect  of  y*  Passengers  w"''  she  is  to  lande  there,  as  of  the  Comodities 
w"''  may  be  likehe  to  be  vented  there. 

Nothinge  hath  been  longe  more  ernestly  desired,  then  the  sethnge  of  the 
affayres  of  the  Colonie,  aswell  for  the  Gouerment  as  otherwayes,  neither 
could  there  haue  been  a  greter  Incouragement  to  the  Planter,  Then  to 
vnderstand  it  to  be  his  Ma'"'^'  gratious  pleasure.  That  noe  psone  of  whome 
they  haue  heertofore  iustlie  coraplayned,  should  have  any  hand  in  the 
Gouerment,  (either  heere  or  there)  And  we  humbly  desire  yo'  Lopps  to 
solycite  his  Ma""  (yf  it  be  not  alredye  donne)  for  the  spedy  Accom-

plishmcnt  therof,  The  rather  because  the  Governors  necessary  occasiones 
require  his  present  retourne. 

His  ma''"'°  gratious  assurance  y*  every  man  shall  haue  his  pticuler  right 
plserved  w""  additione  of  resonable  immunimentC,  \vill)e  a  singuler  meanes 
of  invitinge  many  people  hither,  and  settlinge  them  selves  heere,  Who  for 
the  moste  heertofore,  (by  reason  of  the  many  distractiones  &  discoragc- 
mentC,  Haue  only  cndeavered  a  present  Cropp,  and  theire  hastie  retourne, 
To  y"  greate  hinderance  of  raysinge  staple  Comodities,  &  all  woorkes  of 
woorth  and  Contynuance,  w''''  all  men  will  w""  ernestnes  and  alacrytie 
applye  themselves  to,  when  theire  thoughts  are  fixed  in  this  Countrey, 
And  much  the  rather,  yf  you'  Lopps  shall  obtaine  of  his  ]Ma"'=  y''  remissione 
(for  the  present)  of  the  ympositione  ef  §vpon§  Tobacco,  &  other  comodi- 
ties, for  the  pfectinge  wherof,  since  as  yett  we  must  be  inhable  by  vp- 
holdinge  the  prise  of  Tobacco,  We  humbly  beseech  his  ma*'^  to  contjaiue 
his  favor  in  phibitinge  the  ymportatione  &  sale  of  all  Tobaccoes,  except 
from  this  Colony  and  the  Sommer  Islands,  And  heere  we  cannot  but  make 
remonstrance  to  you''  Loi5ps  how  preiuditiall  those  petty  Plantationes  of 
the  Englishe  in  the  Salvage  Islands  in  the  West  Indyes,  must  proue  to  this 
Colony,  in  effect  to  the  vtter  overthrowinge  of  the  benefitt  of  the  sole 
ymportatione  graunted  to  us  by  his  ma'''',  both  in  respect  of  the  quantities 
they  may  sende.  And  that  vnder  Couler  therof,  much  Spanish  Tobacco 
may  be  ymported  &  vented,  And  yf  the  saide  phibitione  be  not  strictlie 
and  precisely  lookt  to,  y"  m9chante  who  now  hardlie  keepes  himselfe  w*''in 
the  boundes  of  our  proclamation  concerninge  the  rates  of  comodities) 
wiU  take  advantage  therupon  to  inhannse  his  pryses  excessiuely,  Wherby 
the  Colony  wilbe  kept  in  povertie  as  formerly. 

Those  greate  and  ymportant  woorkes,  of  surprysinge  the  Indyans,  dis- 
coveries by  sea  and  lande,  ffortificatione  againste  a  foraigne  Enemy,  that 
they  may  be  throwlie  and  effectually  pformed,  will  require  no  less  nmbers 
then  five  hundred  soldiers  to  be  yeerly  sent  over  for  certen  yeeres,  w'^  a  full 
yeers  pvisione  of  victualls,  apparell,  amies,  munitions,  toole,  &  all  neces-
