Note

In 1906 the Library of Congress published, in two quarto volumes entitled “The
Records of the Virginia Company of London,” the text, from the manuscript in
the Library, of the Court Book containing the minutes of that company’s mectings,
and of the meetings of its council, from April 28, 1619, to June 7, 1624, together
with an elaborate and learned introduction by Miss Susan Myra Kingsbury, now
professor of social economy in Bryn Mawr College, and a list prepared by her of
additional documents illustrative of the company’s history from the date of its
chartering until after its dissolution by the Crown and the consequent conclusion
of its business, These documents, 764 in number, are listed, with bibliographical
references as to their sources, in the section of Miss Kingsbury’s first, volume
(pp. 119-205) entitled ‘List of Records.” The project of publication formed at the
time when those volumes were issued contemplated the printing, in additional
volumes, of the documents thus listed, or of all those among them that had any
historical significance. Their texts are now to be presented, in two volumes num-
bered III, IV, of The Records of the Virginia Company of London. The texts
have been prepared by Miss Kingsbury with great care and accuracy. The first
273 of the documents arranged for publication are presented in the present volume.
A nearly equal number, completing the series, will be presented in Volume IV, now
in the printer’s hands. The two volumes will constitute an addition of great magni-
tude, and of the highest interest, to the materials for the early history of Virginia, and
their preparation, distinctly a labor of love on the part of Miss Kingsbury, places all
future students of that history under a heavy debt of gratitude to their accomplished
editor.

Herpert Putnam,
Librarian of Congress.
Vv
Prefare

The documents contained in Volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia
Company of London are original papers, official and other, of (he company or relating
toit. While the Court Book of the Virginia Company, published as Volumes I and II
of this series, presents minutes of the meetings of the corporation, the sueceeding
volumes contain materials that vivify its decisions and decrees, explain the difficulties
met and overcome by that redoubtable group of adventurers, reveal the petty jeal-
ousies of the administrators, and especially record the controversy between the
company and the Crown that resulted in the dissolution of the corporation and the
ereation of the first erown colony of Great Britain.

Four official sets of records are herein printed or cited. Two are published in full.
One set is the original papers contained in the volume, now preserved in the Library
of Congress, which has long been referred to as “Manuscript Records of the Virginia
Company, Volume III.” One set embodies records of action in law courts by the
company or against the company. ‘They are taken from the records of the various
British courts and were found in the Public Record Office. Two sets are not here
included as originally planned. They have been published in full since this series
was begun. One is the “Courte Booke” of the colony, February 4, 1622/23, through
February 9, 1632/33. Jt is now printed under the title “Minutes of the Council and
General Court of Colonial Virginia,” edited by Dr. H. L. McIlwaine (Richmond, Va.,
1924), The other set of documents has been published in the ‘Acts of the Privy
Council, Colonial”, volume I (London, 1908). Some actions of the council that
concerned the Virginia Company of London are not to be found in that publication.
They are therefore here printed. The collection called the Sackville Papers, dis-
cussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company, Volume I, page
114, was, by the courtesy of the third Lord Sackville, examined by Prof. A. Percival
Newton, of the University of London, and the documents relating to Virginia were
printed in 1922 in the American Historical Review, Volume XXVII, pages 493 to
538 and 738 to 765. Those bearing dates earlier than 1623 are not here reprinted.

Included in this volume are manuscripts from two collections that are unique.
The “Smyth of Nibley” papers give the history of a single settlement, called Smyth’s
(or Smith’s) Hundred, that is typical of the verious hundreds of the colony. They
extend from February 3, 1618/19, to August 1, 1622, inclusive. These papers are all in
the New York Publie Library. The ‘‘Ferrar Papers,’’ on the other hand, now belong-
ing to Magdalene College, Cambridge University, are a veritable gold mine; their
unique value is discussed in the Introduction to the Records of the Virginia Company,
Volume J, They supply a vast amount of information through the correspondence
between the colony and individual planters of the colony and Sir Edwin Sandys,
Nicholas Ferrar, and John Ferrar, and also between Sir Edwin Sandys and the other
officials of the company. Only a few documents are official, including two reports
from the council in Virginia, a record of a Somers Islands court, and some less impor-
tant iterns of this type. The first paper bears the date June 8, 1617, and the last

November 1, 1624. But only a few go beyond midsummer of 1622.
VI
vit PREFACE

On the other hand, the ‘‘Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume
IIT,” do not begin until August 12, 1621, but continue throughout the life of the com-
pany. They differ in character from the Smyth of Nibley Papers and the Terrar
Papers. Asstated above, they record official acts of the council in Virginia and include
commissions, proclamations, orders, laws, letters to and from the council in London,
and petitions to the governor and council in Virginia.

Communications between the company and the Kingor the privy council, and some
letters to and from the governor and council of the colony, were spread on the minutes
of the company, and therefore appear in Volumes I and II, of this series. They are
noi reproduced in Volumes HI and LV, even though the original documents are found
in the other collections.

All documents here published are discussed at Jength in the Introduction to Vol-
umes I and II of this series. Practically every paper indicated as to be included in
the series by the star affixed in the ‘List of Records” that appears in the Introduction
to Volume I is here printed. Two documents (List of Records No. 70 and No. 153)
could not be found, and it has proved impossible to secure a copy of No. 12,

Fifty-seven documents dating earlier than April 28, 1619, when the records in
Volume I begin, are printed in this volume. They inchide all records that had not
heretofore been known or published by Alexander Brown, the Virginia Magazine
of History, or other reliable works on the early history of Virginia. Perhaps the
most important documents found by the editor that are here included are the
“Tnstrucéons Orders and Constituéons to S' Thomas Gates knight Governor of
Virginia” of May, 1609, and the ‘Instructions orders and constituéons ... to...
S* Thomas West knight Lo: La Warr,” 1609/10, by the Virginia Council. These
are the first instructions given by the competent authority to a British colony.

Source material for the history of the company through the year 1622 is presented
in this volume. March 22, 1622, saw the frightful massacre of colonists by the
Indians. The story of that tragedy, the efforts for recovery, and the beginning of the
reestablished colony conclude this volume.

The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Prof. J. Franklin Jameson, chief
of the division of manuscripts in the Library of Congress, for his painstaking care in
reading the proof to the original documents of the ‘“Manuseript Records of the
Virginia Company, Volume III,” and to some of the photostats of material in England,
and also for his constant watchfulness in seeing the documents through the press.

To Marian Carter Anderson the editor is indebted for her valuable and expert
assistance in preparing much of the manuscript, and especially in the difficult reading
of practically all of the proof.

Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index of Volume III, and to her the
editor wishes to express gratitude for the complete and accurate contribution she has
made to the usefulness of the documents in historical research.

A part of the expense for reading the proof and the cost of preparing the index
were met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council.

these inducements.

1. First, y‘ it mought give adventurers, a clearnes and satisfaction, for
y° Iustice of y° action, and so encourage them, and draw on others.

2. That y* Spaniard might out of this intimation reasonably collect, y*
wee vnderstood our owne case to be such, y* the state would neyther feare,
nor be ashamed to proceed in y* persecution ther of, if any Course should
bee held agaynst yt: and yt this Tustifieation of our owne title, would
deterr, or at least retard y® Spaniard from suddayne attempting vs.

And though it were sayd then; That this was a lowe and impotent way to

as a more publique declaration of y® state could doc.

ther is much of a Confession, in euery unnessary Apology: y* to moue
seruple, especially of Conscience, wher ther is afore quiettnes and no
doubting rather shakes and deterrs, then settles, or confirmes. And y*
already some of best Iudgement, startle vpon y° first noyse of y. Phat

2. That y*® Spaniard hath already seene more publique, and authentique
testemonyes, of y® States good affection to y° Iourny, by establishing it
vnder y* great seale: and by y*® seconding, and Iterating supplyes, then
this way can giue him:

Besides it is more then probable yt his Ambassador will forthwith expos-
tulate w'® his Mate about this writing, and then it is not conceau’d how
far his Ma** wilbe pleasd to avow yt, w may intimate disavowing:
Besides yt it seemed not to worke these good effects w* were pretended,
it hath these euident dangers in yt.

1 It will rather hasten y* Spaniards rage, then retard yt; because he will
see it, to grow euery day harder for him to defeat vs.

2 It will rayse vndisputably, two pen-adversaries of diuers sortes: The
first are perfect Spaniards, who will defend y* title vpon y® Donation, of
Alexander, w* is so grounded vpon the principles of theyr religion y*
some of ther best authors haue pronounced yt Heresy to doubt yt. And
wee, (though wee want not inducinge and Convenient arguments from
God, and Nature and Nations) yet haue no such convincinge and obliga-
tory * * * * * * irs, especially towards them, and their ground.
(2] The second sort wilbe neutrall writers, but of Spanish affections:
who because they cannott therby hurt y® Spaniard already established
there, but may slacken vs, if they can cast scruples into our Conscience
§? will wright agaynst y° lawfullnes of plantation in these, as well by y®
Spaniard, as by vs, or any, w*® must necessaryly grow to disputution of
so much intricasy, perplexity, and replication, as shall conduce vnto
theyr end of slackning ws. if no farther. For when at first discouery of
these partes, y° Spaniard did subiect y® Consideration of yt to Casuists,
and Confessors, it became so indeterminable, yt he was forced to resolue
roundly vpon y° worst way, least he should haue none, to prosecute y*

Indians as Barbar’s, and therby Naturally slaues. When after 50 yeares
his Fryars declyn’d him from y* seuere and vnIust course, and he labourd
by men of all learninge to prouide himselfe of a more acceptable title, all
y° reasons, w" were prepard to him, by men of discourse, from y® Indians
transgressing y® Law of Nature; from his [ciuilians] for their denying com-
merce: from his Canonists, by y° Donation: and from his Deuines, by
preparation of religion, were so incohcerent and so resisted by one another,
as many bookes written in his defence, were suppressed in his owne
Kyngdome, and at this day, from all y° authors extant, in y* pointe,
(though they admitt y° purpose of y° donation, yet departing from y°
very lettre) can be gathered for him no title, of Dominion or property,
but only a Magistracy, and Empire, by w* he is allowed to remoue such
impediments, as they had agaynst y° knowledge of Religion.

Because therfore, we shalbe putt to defend our title, uot yet publiquely
quarreled, not only comparatiuely to be as good as y* Spaniards (wt we
doubt not is easy enough, when it shalbe impugned,) (agaynst w* not
w standinge to gouerne them, ther arises y° Donation, and y* wee
seek Dominion) but absolutely to be good agaynst y* Naturall people:
some thought it better to abstayne from this vnnessisary way of proui-
cation, and reserue ourselues to y® defensiue part, when they shall offer
any thing agaynst vs: w will more easyly and satisfactoryly be donne,
and we are like enough to bee too soone putt to yt by them, when they
see y° proportion and forwardnes of this present supply.

tion) then this will follow, w* if we could mayntayne yet wt such
subtelty of distinction, as y° merchant wilbe vneapable of satisfaction

and to keepe it onely as a fitt porte for yo" Shippes to ride before to ariue

it is so accessable, with shippinge that an enemy may be easily vppon
you with all the provision and §of§ ordinance and muniéon and it is not
to be expected that anie fortificaéon [180] there ean endure an enemy that

13 The place you chose for yo" principall Residence and seate to haue
yo" Catle pvisions of Corne foode and Magazin of other muniéon in, as
yo’ greatest strength trust and retraite, must be remoued some good
distance from any navigable riuer except with small boates by wch no
enemy shall dare to seeke yo" habitaéon and if in this place some good

if you be pvided of victuall you may dispute possession till a straunger

their footinge with them against a greater nomb and to winne time wh if
you ean do a stranger cannot longe abide where he must bringe all his
releis with him, and he shall haue no way to beseidge you but by blockinge
you in and plantinge betweene you and the Sea to wth if you haue two
outeletts he must be very able and powerfull that can do it, to prevent
this you shall build some small forte that may discry the sea neere Cape
Comforte, and there hold a reasonable Garrison and keepe alwaies watch
and longe boate that may be ready to take y® alarii and able to cary
away o? men, and munition if you shall not be able to defend it. Besides
it is not safe to lett any of the Savages dwell betwene you and the Sea—
least. they be made guides to yo" enemies. To this Cofaunde wee desire
Captaine Smyth may be allotted aswell for his earnest desire as the greate
confidence & trust that we haue in his care & diligence.

18 The second enemy is the Natiues who can no way hurte you but by
fire or by destroyinge yo" Catle, or hinderinge yo" workes by Stealth or
yo" passages in small nombers, and in this sorte of warr, there is most
pill yf you be not very Carefull, for if they may destroy but one haruest
or burne yo" townes in the night they will leaue you naked and exposed
to famine and Could, and convey themselues [183] into wodes, where
revenge wilbe §as§ difficult as vaneeessay as vnnecessary to prevent that
you must keepe good watches in the fielde and suffer none of them to
come nere yo" corne in those daungerous seasons and continuall centinells

;, Without the walles or vttermost Centinells defences in the night, and you
must giue order that yo’ Catle be kept in heards waited and attended on
by some small watch or so enclosed by them selues that they destroy not
yo’ corne and other seed provisions:

19 For Powhaton and his Weroances it is Clere even to reason beside our
experience that he loued not our neigbourhood and therefore you may no
way trust him, but if you finde it not best to make him yo' prisoner yet
you must make him yo’ tributary, and all other his weroances about him

Hono’ §* vjion the returne of the last Fleete of Shipps wh brought my

Lord La Warr (our Lord Governour & Captaine Generall,) into this

Countrie; I did not »neé forbeare to challenge yo" noble patience W‘h

reading vnworthy & fruitles Lines, & although at this plsent I am little or
1289334
30 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

nothing better furnished wth any matter of valew, either for discovery
of Mynes, or ought els worth your Knowledge, yet when I consider yo"
many and noble favours towards me (wth when I forgett to acknowledge,
let me for ever be putt out of yo™ remembrance) I thought good to wright
something, if but thereby to plserve my humble service in yo" honovred
memory.

For the plsent state & condiéon of this Countrie, it wants only Sup-
portes, round & free supplies, both of men & moneyes, to make good the
mayne & pfitable endes of a moste happy plantation. Concerning the
Countrie & the soile thereof, wee finde it fertile & full of encrease, bringing
forth goodly Corne, many kinde of Fruites, naturall Vines & quickly
rendring vs our owne Countrie seedes, & Rootes wth wee bury therein,
as prosperous & unchangeable for tast and quantitie as England it selfe
For these CoModities of pitch & tarr Soape ashases, Wood Iron &c. most
true it is Noble 8‘, that there they bee most plentifully to bee returned
home, if soe bee it the meanes & skilfull workemen together wth fitt
pvisions for those Labourers (vntill the Colour may quitt some of theis
Charges, by planting their owne Vines, sowing their owne Corne, &
broodinge their owne Cattaile, Kine, Swine, Goates &c. wth would shortly
be, & had bin ere this, had the Governm’ bin carefully & honestly estab-
lished & carried here theis 3 yeres passed) may be provided & sent over
to worke in those businesses.

For the opening & finding out of Silver or gold wee have now probable
Intelligence to bee brought vnto: for wch Cause our Lord Governour
hath gathered together most of his Choysest men & intendeth a voyadge
forthw'h vp vnto a famous fall or Cataract of Waters, where leaving his
pinasses & Boates safe riding, he purposeth to Leade vs vp into the Land
called the Monocane 2 or 3 dayes Journey, where at the foote of certaine
mountaines hee meaneth to build a Forte, & there to wynter some of his
people, who shall every day digg at those mynes, & though they prove
not according to §o'§ expectation, yet wee have lost nothing but our
Labour, wth this advantage neverthelesse that wee shall have a redoubt
& some of our men in it, against the next springe, when his Lp intendeth
to martch that way something more southerly for the finding out the
South Sea.
1611(?) 31

Wee have some hope also by a Westerly Trade thorough a faire & goodly
Bay lying in the height of 382 (some 30 leagues from our owne Bay)
newly discovered since his Lp’s coffiing heither, from whence wee pmise
our selues many commodities both of fish from the Bay, for our Colour,
and from the tractable Indians of that place (of whome wee have made
already some tryall) both Corne, furres &e.

And (Hono?” 8") I have by theis few yet troublesome Lines given you the
accompt & truth of what wee know and purpose concerning this his
Ma"* Countrie & newe Kingdome, as further passages herein (material
& worthy yo" Knowledge) shall occure & bee offred vnto vs, I will p'sume
to addresse them vnto you, ever vowing myselfe in the vtmost of my
endeavoures to doe you service, I kisse yo' Honoured Hand. In Virginia

being enformed by the said Planters and Adventurers as well of there
greate Charge beestowed in that Diseou9y and plantaton as of the

further extent of ground and Island@ adiacent in the said Lres-patente
mentoned and graunted togeather with such further priviledges as to his
gratious wisdome did seeme Convenient for the advauncing of so noble
an acton And his said Ma" of his more abundant grace and favour to
the said plantaéon did allso Cause a peculier and speall Clause to bee
inserted in the said tres-patent€ namelie that whereas the failing and
non paymt of such soiies of money as haue beene promised in adventure for
the advauncem! of the said plantacon hath beene often by expience found
to bee daungerous and p‘iudiciall to the same and much to haue hindered
the pgresse and pceeding of the said plantaéon and for that it seemed
vnto his Ma” a thing reasonable that such psons as by there hand-wryting
haue engaged themselves for the paym' of there adventures and after-
warde neglecting there faith and pmise should bee Compellable to make
good and keepe the same that therefore his Matie¢ will and pleasure was
that in any sute or sutes Commenced or to bee Commenced in any of his
Matiee Courté at Westm9 or ells where by the said Treasurer and Companie
or otherwise against any such pson or psons that his Judges for the tyme
being bothe in the Courte of Chauncery and at the Common lawe should
favour and further the said sutes so farr foorth as lawe and equitie will
in any wise suffer and pmitt as in and by the said last recited Tres-patent¢
amongst diuers other favours and priviledges therein Contayned it doth
and may more at large appeare. And after the said first grant of incor-
poraéon so obtained the said Treasurer and Companie did sett out
Certaine shipps brought and furnished with all kinde of necessarie pro-

visions and munition and well manned with souldiers and psons of other
quallities and Condiéons fitt for such an enterprise hoping and intending
thereby and by that greate Charge and p'paraton to haue pfected and
setled that plantaton But finding it afterward to bee a worke of greater
difficultie and being enformed by S* Thomas Gates Knight (whome they
had imploied there with the Charge and title of Generall of that Colonie
who was newly sent home from Virginia for that busines) that a greater
supply of men and money must bee had and was requisite and necessary
for the accomplishmt of that honorable acton and the establishm' of the
said plantaéon the said Companie entred into a newe Counsell and finding
that without a newe aide and supplie to bee sent vnto Virginia (such as
was required by the said S* Thomas Gates in the name of the Lord Gov-
ernor and Colonie there) so honorable and religious an acéon must fall
to the ground to the vtter ou9throwe of the said Companie the losse of
all there former Charges and expence the detriment of Christian Religion
and greate preiudice vnto this Kingdome It was finally Concluded and
agreed that as well all those who had beene former Adventurers in the
said plantaton and free of the said Companie as those who were to bee
receaved into the freedome societie and fellowshipp of the said Companie
for the tyme to Come should sewally and pticulerly adventure and lay

tianitie, ffor the furtherance of w** honorable intent and purpose, it
pleased his Ma** (as this defendat taketh it) to incorporate the Compl
as in the said bill of Complaint is menéoned, and this defend‘ further
taketh it to be true, that after some mony adventured and spent in the
said buisines, the Compl* found it to be a matter of greater difficultie
and charge then they before Imagined and thought it would haue beene,
for they were (as this defend‘ taketh it) informed by S' Thomas Gates kn*

plishm* of that hono”® acéon then formerly had beene imployed and gath-
ered, wherevpon the foresaid companie the Compl‘ and others entred
into a new councell or consultaton concerninge the afforesaid buisines of

a new aid and supply of mony and men for virginia such as was then
formerly propounded and required by the said S* Thomas Gates, the
foresaid hono®® ac@on and intenéon of plantaton of virginia would faile,
and not take that effect as was desired, and therevpon some three yeares
since or thereabouté as this defend' now remembreth, vpon the new con-
sultaton afforesaid had amongest the Compl'* and companie for the good
of virginia concerninge what further charge in mony would be requisite
for the furtheringe and accomplishinge of the foresaid intended plantaton
and acéon of virginia, it was concluded and agreed amongest them the
said Compl that Eyghteene thousand pound¢ at the least to be gathered
in three yeares then next followinge would be but a sufficient some of
money for the accomplishinge and effectinge of the foresaid pnte service
for virginia, and that it was also necessarie to haue sixe hundred men
furnished sent thither before may then next followinge the consultaéon
spoken of beinge about Michaelmas 1610 and that vnles the said 18"™%
and 600. men might forthwtt in certeyntee be prouided the said service
would not at all be effected or pformed Therefore for the gatheringe of
the foresaid 18"" and for the prouidinge of the said 600. men in the three
yeares afforesaid at the tyme of the Consultaton spoken of it was agreed
by the foresaid Complt'® and companie that a booke concerninge the

not furnished and sent for the said purpose accordinge to the said con-

List of Records No, 37

Whereas the Royal, most excellent Majesty, under his great seal of Eng-
land, authorizes the Virginia Company for the setting up of a lottery for
the benefit of that Plantation.

We by virtue of said grant do earnestly pray and desire you M* Mayor,
Mr Recorder, and the Aldermen of the City your brethren to be assistants
to our deputies Gabriel Barber and Lott Peere being also members of our
Company, to whom, for the approved trial we have of their care and
sufficiency, we have committed the management of a running lottery to
be kept in that, your City of Salisbury, requesting so much more earnestly,
your furtherance therein, for that it is for so good a work as the upholding
of that Plantation which we have now great hope and greater than before,
shall stand and flourish to the honor and benefit of the realin.

And although we are well satisfied of these men’s integrity, and have
already given them an oath for their just and true dealing in this employ-
ment, with all men, yet to Satisfy you and the world in the most exact
manner that may, we desire you to receive the key here enclosed, of the
prizes and to see them mingling of them with the blanks, and appoint one
or two of your City, men of care to lock up and open the same every
morning and evening, and permit a ehild who shall be allowed for his
pains, to draw out the lots for all that adventure, as shall those we employ
not be suspected of popularity who shall only pay out those prizes that
shall be drawn, and yourselves be encouraged if they shall so desire to
give them your testimony of the said proceedings.

describes it as ‘among the records of the city of Salishury.”’

In so doing both ourselves shall have great cause to thank you and the
Plantation to acknowledge your love and kindness towards the same.

And so we bid you very hearty farewell.

By his Majesties Councell for Virginia

Whereas upon the returne of Sir Thomas Dale Knight, (Marshall of
Virginia) the Treasurer, Councell and Company of the same, have been
throughly informed and assured of the good estat of that Colony, and
how by the blessing of God and good government, there is great. plentie
and inerease of Corne, Cattell, Goates, Swine, and such other provisions,
necessary for the life and sustenance of man; And that there wants nothing
for the setling of that Christian Plantation, but more hands to gather and
returne those commodities which may bring profit to the Adventurers,
and encouragement to others: And whereas thereupon the Company hath
given a commission to Captaine Samuel Argol to be the present, Governour
of that Colonie, who hath undertaken to transport and earry thither a
certain number of men, upon his owne charge, and the charge of other
his friends that joyne him in that Voyage; in which divers men of good
qualitie have resolved to adventure, and to goe thither themselves in

Couneell and Company for the same Plantation, have thought good to
declare and make knowne to all men by these presents, that wee have
resolved to give free leave and license to any who are now remaining in
Virginia, at his will and pleasure to returne home into England, which
liberty wee doe likewise grant and confirme unto all those which hereafter
from time to time shall go thither in person, without any other restraint,
there to aske leave of the Governour (for the time being) to depart. And
therefore if any man be disposed to send for any of his friends from thence,
he may hereby take notice, that he hath full power and meanes to doe
eyther of them at his good deseretion.

Honored S*

The many courtysies and favo" I haue receaued at yo" hands shall
(during my life) bynd me to yo" in my best service: and so often as
occasion shall offer itself, I will not forgett to express the same. At this
psent I haue breifly noted to yo", in what estate wee found the Colony;
and of o° speedy passage hether.

Upon the 10th of Aprill wee departed from Plymouth, and the next daie
lost sight of the Lyzard, having the Treasurer in o' Company, weh kept
wth us about 3 weeks: at what tyme we lost her in foggy weather w™
contynued after 20. daies, in w** tyme wee hadd hardly a daie to make
a certeyne obseruacon. The same daie month (according to the daie of
the weeke) that we lost the lands end, we fell w'" the dangerous shoulder
of Cape Codd, runnying in one glass from 20 to 5 and 4 fathom water,
not able to see (by reason of the thyck fogg) halfe a Cables length from
the shipp. Here wee ancored all night, and the next daie w® no small
pill gott cleere of them. From heare wee shaped a Course along the
Coast of Virginia, keeping our lead all the waie, weh was o' best guide
having so good a Pylott as o’ Gou'n', the fogg still contynuyng, and
arryved at Point Comfort y® 15 of May, all ot Company being in good
health, only one man dyed, who was sickly before we came from England.
Thus it pleased God to bless vs w a speedy and psperous passage, yea
hadd wee not bene troubled, to free o* selves from those showlds, and
JUNE 8, 1617 Kal

wt" mysty weather, we hadd assuredly (by Gods help) arryued in Virginia
in a months space. Fhe next daie befe Two, or 3 daies after arriued
Captaine Martyne w' the pynnace all his men in good health to inercase
ot ioyes.

Wee found the Colony (God be thanked) in good estate and inioyng a
firmer Peace and more plenty, howeu' in buildings, fortyficaéons, and
for went of boats, much ruyned and greate want. Or plsent Gou'n' at
James towne is repayring and making straight what he fyndeth decayed
and crooked, to whose good indeavo™ and noble disposicon ot Colony
hath bene, is, and wilbe much indebted. All men eheerefully labor about
their grounds, their harts and hands not ceasing from worke, though
many have scarce ragges to cou’ their naked bodyes. English wheate,
barly, Indyan Corne, Tobacco greate plenty in the ground. Hemp and
flax seed distributed to most men by the Gou'n’ and is putt into the
ground: nothing neglected, w°' any waies may be avayleable to advance
the Colony, and to give incouragem' to yo'self and the rest of the Ho?!
Company. The Cattle thrive and increase exceeding well, the ploughes
yerely worke and oxen are plentyfull. The Indyans very loving, and
willing to parte wt their childeren. My wives death is much lamented;
my childe much desyred, when it is of better strength to endure so hard
a passage, whose life seh greately extinguisheth the scrrow of her loss,
saying all must die, but tis enough that her childe liueth. I know not
how I may be censured for leaving my childe behind me, nor what hazard
I may ineurr of yo" noble loue and other of my best frends. At my
departure from Gravesend (nothwthstanding I was ymportuned) I hadde
no such intent. But m ot short passage to Plymouth, in smothe water,
I found such feare and hazard of his health (being not fully recoucred of
his sicknes) and lack of attendance (for they who looked to him hadd
need of nurses themselues, and indeed in all o* passage pved no better)
that by the advise of Captaine Argall, and diuers who also foresaw the
danger and knew the inconvenyence hereof pswaded me to what I did.
At Plymouth I found S* Lewes Stukely so nobly mynded toward me,
that he most earnestly intreated to haue the keping of him, vntill my
Brother tooke further order. I thought good to rectyfie yo" hereof, and
desyre yo' self and all the Company, for those causes, to hold me excused,
if in their iudgem“ I may be censured to haue erred herein. A firme

contynuance of yo" favo™ and love toward me I daylie praie for. And
although greate is my loss, and much my sorrow to be depriued of so
greate a comfort, and hopes I hadd to effect my zealous intencons and
desyres as well in others, as in her whose soule (I doubt not) resteth in
eternall happynes: yet such temperance haue I learned in psperity, and
patience in adversitie, that I will as ioyfully receiue euill, as good at the
hand of God: and assuredly trust that Hee, who hath plserved my childe,
euen as a brand snatched out of the fier, hath further blessings in store
for me, and will give me strength and courrage to vndertake any religious
and charitable ymploym', yo'self and the Ho>* Company shall comand
me, and w* in duty I am bound to doe. Now my last request at this
tyme is to yo'self, whom I haue found a father to me, my wife and childe,
and will eu' acknowledg it w'* the best gratefullnes my hart and penn
can offer, that yo" would be pleased as yo" haue begun and ben tke one of

[517] Certain Reasons touching y* most convenient times & Seasons of y°
year for y° Magazine Ship to Set forth for Engl* towards Virg*

1 To come out in June & be here in Sept? a temperate time then is y°
harvest of Corn & Tob° and one man may tend & keep as much as 2 can
house & Cure After Sept wind blowing at N° West will make a long
passage

2 Weather after Sept so unconstant that goods cant be landed or shipt
without hazard or damage

3 Because few Taylors y® people won’t get their cloathes time enough for
winter

4 you’l then haue y° best Tob°® y*® bad not then ready

5 your ships may get home by Candlemas before y° East Indie Ships set
out w* will help y* Speedy venting y° Tob°

6 If the Ship dont come before March (our Seed time) we cant afford
time to attend Magazine

7 for want of boats it will be 14 daies loss to a man in Transp. goods in
w time he may loose all his Tob? & Corn

8 if yo" Ships return after April y* heat of y® hold will hurt y* Tob°

9 furnish yo? Magazine w'* more than for y* p'sent & let a continual
trade be on foot and then at y® arrival of your Shiping you’l haue Com?
ready & they’l be soon dispatched

10 If you grant more sueh Commissions for Gen' trade as you have done
to Capt Martin you'l overthrow yo" magazine. conferr w‘* y® bearer m’
Dade who has had a y™ experience & can satisfie you in all points.

The Treasurer and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of the City of
London for the first Colony in Virginia. To Captain George Yeardly
Elect Governor of Virginia and to the Council of State there being or to
be Greeting.

Our former cares and Endeavours have been chiefly bent to the procuring
and sending people to plant in Virginia so to prepare a way and to lay a
foundation whereon A flourishing State might in process of time by the
blessing of Almighty God be raised. Now our trust being that under the
Government of you Captain Yeardly with the advice and Assistance of the
said Council of State such public provisions of Corn and Cattle will again
be raised as may draw on those Multitudes who in great Abundance from
diverse parts of the Realm were preparing to remove thither if by the late
decay of the said public Store their hopes had not been made frustrate and
their minds thereby clene discouraged We have thought good to bend our
present cares and Consultations according to the Authority granted unto
us from his Majesty under his great Seal to the setling there of A laudable

form of Government by Majestracy and just Laws for the happy guiding

first to give thankes vnto God who hath raysed me so worthy a ffreind,
next to retorne to your good selfe all my best and strongest endevors in
ffaythfull Love and service, whereby I may in some measure cleserve your
so great kindnes shewed me, meane whille I retorne vnto you vnfayned
thankes, with pmise to pforme to the vttmost of my strenght and vnder-

wayghty worke w* I have by god his pvidence now in hand, even with
all the dilligence I can, wherein considering the littell helpe I have for
men of vnderstanding and honesty with willingnes to lend theire helping
hand vnto me, I find great troble and some diffulty, w I make shift so
well as I can to wade through being in many things by argument opposed
by those by whé I should be strenghned, the reasons endeed being that.
they themselves §some of them§ have bin partakers in Argalls actions, the
rest having formerly by his pswasion sett theire hands to vntruthes are
now vnwilling to give themselves the ly but rather care not yf the whole
publike where overthrowne then theire pvate Credit crabt, to be taxed
with indiscretion or dishonesty but this they Smother and Smooth over,
and I am willing to lett pass so the pincipall may be pfeeted, and so it
will, and playnly apeare by Testimony vpon cath that Argall hath wrought
Craftily and dishonestly in all his peeedings, and they won with the love
of his good Licour, and fayre ptestations to be Joyned to sett theire hands
to that w® they cannott now chuse but in theire harts condem [12] May
it please you to consider it will be alltogether requisite that I should be

in truth I find thé both willing to spare what tyme they can for the publike
espetially M* Macok who is endeed my Cheife strenght in the ryght all-
though while Capt Argall was heere he did a littell run with the tyme, as
it was his safest Course for endeed, there was no daring to deny what he
would have done, what in pticullar I have done, as I was Commanded by
§my§ Comissions and Instructions, may it please you that I refer you to

the generall letters, what remayneth with as much speed as tyme and
other most needfull ocations will give leave, I meane god willing to pfect,
allthough for restitution fro Capt Argalls goods and Lands to be made
both to the Publike and plvate, there is found here at my Coming but
littell to make it good for having that littell tyme to run away frd the
Collony he Caryed his Cheifest goods with him, leaving only behind him
his Cattell w*' is the Cheifest and some other things arysing to no great
valew, but Concerning the publike, espetially for Corne, I will vse all the
care and Industry I can to rayse a stock by way of trade to w** end I
desire some trucking stuff may be sent me, for Cattell I finding I finding?!
none to remayne to the Collony at my Arivall, I know not as yett how to
rayse that stock, but so soone as I can I will examine more exactly how
every man hath come by his Cattell so yt yf I find any vnlaufully bought
I may restore thé to the Publike, there are yett in the possession of Capt
West six Cowes with the encrease w° Capt Argall at his Arivall when he
had served himselfe and those he would, sett apart for my Lord Delawars
vse but my Lorde being dead they had now bin otherwyse to have bin
disposed to the Publike vse, w** I would have done but that Capt West
assureth me that my Lady Delavar hath allready gotten a grant of thé
ffrd the Company, w* till I heare fro you I lett. them remayne in his pos-
session, being no whitt the farther yf the Company shall thinke fitt either
to M* Wodall or otherwise to dispose of thé

(28] I find that we * * * Smyths Hundred are alltogether destitute
of Cowes therefore I sho[ul]d be glad you would take order we may be
furnished with those, and more I hope you have, pvided that we may
buy of thé that are coming in the Shipp, for oxen of those that remayne
here to the Collony I entend about Michallmas to take as many as will
sett vp 3 ploughs at Smythes Hundred, for we have there great store of
good Cleered grounds, this yeare both before and since my coming in

Cheifest care must be for Corne, whereof I hope the next yeare to send
you word of plenty, Iam sory that I shall not this yeare send home tobako
as I well hoped to have done, what I fayle this yeare I doubt not but to
make good the next, when I shall have the whole winter before hand to

the Publike buisines doth much hinder me and keepe me fré looking after
that of Smyths Hundred, where I wish to be pilsent oftner then my ocea-
tions will suffer me. agayne, I want some experienced men for officers and
Baylyes to direct the workes in my absence, for lack whereof there are
many things canot goe well foreward when I am away—and to say truth
it would desire my plsence there alltogether and [ could be well content,
so yt the publike were otherwise by gods apoyntimen well pvided for, to
spend my tyme wholly in that employment. There hath lately hapened
a misfortune done by him who Comanded there M' Eps who I found
cheife in the buisines at my coming M’ Haull and M* Neman being dead,
Mr: Eps being a hopefull yong gentellman I constituted Captayne over the

surender my place and Comand, and be as ready and foreward to doe
my best service to the Collony in what I may as yf I still remayned in
the Goverment, neither will it seeme harsh to me to be comanded as I
my selfe have done espetially by one whd I ean obey with such Love, as
I shall doe vnto him, then allso shall I be able to attend with Dilligence
that bewsines w’? partly through my absence hath so much miscarryed
T meane the place I love and greive to see it yett not thrive Sowthampton
Hundreth, and to speake truth it is Impossible for any man that shall be
Governour throughly to looke vnto the peeed of any one pticular planta-
tion, in regard the publike Affayres of the Collony and the care of all will
draw him fro that dayly regard a plvate plantation doth and will require,
and so shall he be forced to trust others and [2] to beare the blame himselfe,
yett Sir I beseech you not to conceave that I goe about contrary to my
pmise both to god your selfe and the Company to shyse my selfe out of
the Goverment of Virginia for yf I spend my lyf substance strengh and
all I have in the service thereof, I shall thinke my selfe hapy to finish my
course in such a worke, and will not be found a murmurer agaynst god,
yf he shall please to pick me out for the same. But being I have now
well weyghed and considered that I may be able to doe the Country as
good servise, yea and being best acquainted with my owne disposition,
better service then yf I did continew Governour, and that in many respects
w your selfe Sowthampton Hundreth and allso the whole Company shall
fynd god willing, yett wherein for the pticulars I will not boast, till I
shall have pformed thé, in execution whereof I shall not stick to spend
my Lyfe for the effecting of such matters for the Publike good, I doe now
therefor beseech you Sir since my servise to the Country shall be no less
but more, that you would be pleased my tyme of 3 years being expired
to give your ffurtherance for this gent Capt Thorpe to be Chossen and
1619 125

established Governour of Virginia in my stead, wherein I know and am
well assurd you shall doe a most worthy worke.

I have now sent home my Ship I bought of Capt Ward and M* Bargraves
Atornyes, having in hir such tobako as my selfe and ffreinds have thought
good to adventure in hir vnto flushing, seeing that by pelamation wee
are restrayned for sending of any into England, w® I am the more boulder
to doe since the Company have advertised of theire entents therein allso
and therefore I hope it will not be ill taken, my Ship I hope shall fynd
better sucses then my Pinas w™ since the Company have bought hir I
shall desire may doe the good service to w™ I will ad my best advice and
ffurtherance to Capt Nuce for the employing hir to the companyes beni-
ffitt, M' Bargrave thinkes he had a hard bargayne in the sale of the Ship
and Pinas, but I am sure they cost me a sound pryse, and had I sent the
tobako home I gave for thé T would not have douted to haue bought too
better vessels with halfe the prys of that tobako, though perhaps he
myght find but a bad markett for want of a good Chapman [24] yett
the gent shall fynd me ready to doe him any pleasure I] may to give him
helpe in his transportation att any tyme whilse I shall vse hir, though I
know he eannott Chuse but make more mony of the tobako then they
both cost him, and had they come home his they would have bin as dead
a comodity as the Pinas was being myne, but he is a man as I conceave
that wicheth well to the plantation and doth entend himselfe to come
over, wherefor for his encoragment I doubt not s but in his voyage to
pleasure him and thus much yf you please you may certify him, This
bearer Cap* Rostingam my wyfes Nephew, though yong yett of good
worth and discretion as by experience had of him here in Virginia | may
speake, him I most humbly recomend vnto your Noble ffavor beseeching
you to afford vnto him your wonted courtesy, and your best assistance
in all Lawfull causes wherein he shall have ocassion to entreat your helpe,
herein as in all other your great ffavors shewed me I shall §be§ most
thankfull vnto you for any flavor shewed him as yf the same were Imediatly
to my selfe, and doe not doubt but yf you shall please to give him admitans
into your ffavor but that in some measur he will deserve it, and Manger
all Malitious false forestalled reportes acquitt himselfe and win your

St I vnderstand by this bearer that you goe tew towards London vpon

lowing. In the mean time let mee intreat you as soone as you come vp
to desire my cosin Thorpe to write to mee some answear of the letter I
wrote to him the weeke after my last comming from London concerning
our forrest busines, that I may vnderstand beefore my going vp what is
determined concerning the same; desiring him to send his letter by some
messenger that may conveigh it hither to mee by monday come senight
at the farthest.

I will leave order here beefore my going vp for 10" to bee delivered towards
the repairing and furnishing of our ship for Virginia, which is as much
as my 4" part (by our computation) will amount vnto for that charge:
If it shall exceed that computation, it shall bee afterwards supplied for
my part at my returne. I pray you remember to help §mee§ to 12 men
for my part according to your promise; for that these parts are so barren
of men fit for that compleiment that I must wholy relie vpon your help
therein. I wish that wee might all agree vpon the entertaining of my
cosin Wilt: Chester for our chief in that busines vpon the conditions
propownded by my cosin Berkley; for that I conceave the busines will
not bee well ordered without the oversight of a sufficient man to bee in
authoritie over the rest: And I thinke that the sparing him one man
out of each of our partes will bee plentifully recompenced with the
service hee will doe vs kere there. And therefore I pray you consider

After ot very harty comendaéons, we have wt great ioy vnderstood of
yo" safe arrivall in Virginia, and of yor firme resolution to reforme those
JUNE 21, 1619 147

errors w% have formerly been coifiitted One chiefe whereof hath byn
the excessive applying of Tobacco, and the neglect to plant Corne w*" of
all other thing¢ is most necessarie for the increase of that planta-
tion. Wee therfore much comending yor resolution therein doe wtall
earnestly pray yo® that nothing whatsoever may divert yo" from
that worthy Course. The rather for that it is now high tyme
(all thing@ considered) to settle the Plantation in that proportion of
strength as to defend it selfe against all forraigne enimyes, w°* cannott
be don w'tout multitude of people to be sent, whereof there is no other
soe forcible attractive as the plenty of Corne, and other pvision to enter-
taine them (by way of loan) at their first arrivall, The hope that is
conceived of yo" industrious and iust carriage for the publique & generall
good doth cause great expectation of prosperous successe in the specdy
bringing of that plantation vnto that pfection wt hope wee pray yo" by
yo" best endevo™ to encrease there, And we assure yo" that on o" part¢
there shalbe nothing defective to correspond w our like endevours here
to the vtmost of our powers vpon all occasions.

Wee cannott but in pticular comend yo" carefull lie vpon the pcecdinge
of the Treasurer sett out by Captaine Argall and coneurr wt yo" in
opinion of the importance thereof wee pray yo" therfore according to
our former instructions that nothing be neglected in that busines. And
that yo" geve diligent order that the shipp be seased vpon ymediatly
vpon her returne, and examynaéon taken of her course and pecedinge,
that Justice may be don to all parties as the case shall require. And wee
pray yo" to certifie vs at large, of yo™ doinge therein ffor the rest wee
referr yo" to our first instrucéons nothing doubting according to yor
promise and our trust yo" will in all thinge observe them to the vtmost
of yo" power.

The outrage don by the Chekohomini deserveth a sharpe revenge, and it
standeth yo" vpon in matter of state to pceed therein w a strong hand,
not only to the psonall destruction of the murtherers, but the removing
that people further of from our Territories by all lawfull meanes if the
same be not allready don by Captaine Argall, as he scemetii to in sinuate,

other fifty vpon the colledge land at Henrico. Wee sett them out soe as
to be wt" yo" in October next. Wee praie yo" very hartily to make such
p'paration for them in both places against theyr comyng as that they

Aceording to an Order of Courte made yesterday beeing the 7" of this
instant July the Cofiittees aforesaid haveing mett & maturely considered
of the matters by the said Order referrd to §by§$ them to be decided doe
touching the same resolue & Order as followeth. ffirste for the ill & con-
temptible language w’ passed in open Courte from M‘ Alderman Johnson
to St Edwyn Sandis Treasuror for Virginia (houlding likewise the place
of Governo’) they concurre in opinion w*'* the Courte that there was noe
occasion of offence at all at that tyme given by S* Edwyn Sandys, nor
any speach, (as they whoe were eare Witnesses hereof conceaue) §past§
from him w mighte iustly be excepted against but on the contrary he
after longe forbearance pressing the mo payment of certaine mony oweing
to the Company by the Magazine (the direction whereof particularly
concernes the office of the said Alderman Johnson) did that w*t by vertue
of his place he oughte, and by speciall oath & he was bound to doe. See-
ondly they conceaue that both the word¢ and gesture of the said Alder-
man at that tyme were not onely vndecent & vneivill but very injurious
insomuch that by them much §wrong as also§ contempte & indignitye was
offered as well to the whole body of the Courte (whose person the Gov-
erno' did then sustaine & whose cause he contended for) as to 5° Edwyn
Sandis in his owne particuler. Out of w% consideraéons they houlde
that the Aldermans offence is great & the rather for that in regard of the
quality of his person & gravity of his yeres others may by his example
150 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

be animated to houlde a slighte esteeme both of the Officers & pceedinge
of the said Courte and make those meetinge w* shoulde tende onely to
the furtherance of that noble & pious [2] worke (for w™ they are appointed
by his Ma‘ Letters Patent@, to assemble themselues) to be a place to
vent theire owne spleene, & particular passions a thinge most vnfitte &
w (if it be not plvented) will soone bringe wt it the ruyne & distruction
of the whole businesse. And therefore in theire opinions deserves a hard
censure especially if they shoulde guide theire Judgement¢ herein by
such examples as were alleadged to be vsuall in cases resembling this
w they haue in hand. But for that they desire rather to prevent a
future ill then to be severe in this Inte particular they doe order that for
this tyme M* Alderman ¥ shall onely at the nexte Courte (to be helde
for Virginia) make publike acknowledgement of his error, and desire both
the Treasuro™ & Company to remitte the offence by him done to eyther
of them. And §they§ doe further aduise that vpon this occasion some
stricter lawe may be made by the said Treasuro', Counsell & Company
againste any whoe shall offend in the like kinde hereafter.

The most convenient place we could finde to sitt in was the Quire of the
Churehe Where Sir George Yeardley, the Governor, being sett downe
in his accustomed place, those of the Counsel of Estate sate nexte him
on both hands excepte onely the Secretary then appointed Speaker, who
sate right before him, John Twine, clerke of the General assembly, being
placed nexte the Speaker, and Thomas Pierse, the Sergeant, standing
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 155

at the barre, to be ready for any service the Assembly shoulde comaund
him. But forasmuche as men’s affaires doe little prosper where God’s
service is neglected, all the Burgesses tooke their places in the Quire till
a prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the Minister, that it would please God
to guide and sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and the good
of this Plantation. Prayer being ended, to the intente that as we had
begun at God Almighty, so we might proceed with awful and due respecte
towards the Lieutenant, our most gratious and dread Soveraigne, all the
Burgesses were intreatted to retyre themselves into the body of the
Churche, which being done, before they were fully admitted, they were
ealled in order and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it)
tooke the oathe of Supremacy, and entred the Assembly. At Captaine
Warde the Speaker tooke exception, as at one that without any Comis-
sion or authority had seatted himselfe either upon the Companics, and
then his Plantation would not be lawfull, or on Captain Martin’s lande,
and so he was but a limbe or member of him, and there could be but two
Burgesses for all. So Captaine Warde was comanded to absent himselfe
till such time as the Assembly had agreed what was fitt for him to doe.
After muche debate, they resolved on this order following:

An order concluded by the General assembly concerning Captaine Warde,
July 30th, 1619, at the opening of the said Assembly.

At the reading of the names of the Burgesses, Exception was taken against
Captaine Warde as having planted here in Virginia without any authority
or comission from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in Englande.
But considering he had bene at so great chardge and paines to augmente
this Colony, and adventured his owne person in the action, and since that
time had brought home a good quantity of fishe, to relieve the Colony
by waye of trade, and above all, because the Comission for authorising
the General Assembly admitteth of two Burgesses out of every plantation
without restrainte or exception, Upon all these considerations, the As-
sembly was contented to admitt of him and his Licutenant (as members
of their body and Burgesses) into their society, Provided, that the said
Captaine Warde with all expedition, that is to saye between this and the
nexte general assembly (all lawful impediments excepted), should procure
from the Tresurer, Counsell and Company in England a comission lawfully
156 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

to establish and plant himselfe and his Company as the Chiefis of other
Plantations have done. And in case he doe neglect this he is to stande to
the censure of the nexte general assembly. To this Captaine Warde, in
the presence of us all, having given his consente and undertaken to per-
forme the same was, together with his Lieutenant, by voices of the whole
Assembly first admitted to take the oath of Supremacy, and then to make
up their number and to sitt amongst them.

This being done, the Governor himselfe alledged that before we proceeded
any further it behooved us to examine whither it were fitt, that Captaine
Martin’s Burgesses shoulde have any place in the Assembly, forasmuche as
he hath a clause in his Patente which doth not onely exempte him from
that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders which the great charter
saith are to extende over the whole Colony, but also from diverse such
lawes as we must be enforced to make in the General Assembly. That
clause is as followeth: Item. That it shall and may be lawfull to and for
the said Captain John Martin, his heyers, executours and assignes to
governe and comaunde all suche person or persons as at this time he
shall carry over with him, or that shalbe sente him hereafter, free from any
comaunde of the Colony, excepte it be in ayding and assisting the same
against any forren or domestical enemy.

Upon the motion of the Governor, discussed the same time in the assembly,
ensued this order following:

An order of the General Assembly touching a clause in Captain Martin’s
Patent at James Citty, July 30, 1619.

After all the Burgesses had taken the oath of Supremacy and were admitted
into the house and all sett downe in their places, a Copie of Captain Martin’s
Patent was produced by the Governor out of a Clause whereof it appeared
that when the general assembly had made some kinde of lawes requisite for
the whole Colony, he and his Burgesses and people might deride the whole
company and chuse whether they would obay the same or no, It was
therefore ordered in Courte that the foresaid two Burgesses should withdraw
themselves out of the assembly till suche time as Captaine Martin had made
his personall appearance before them. At what time, if upon their motion,
if he would be contente to quitte and give over that parte of his Patente,
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 157

and contrary thereunto woulde submitte himsclfe to the general forme of
governement as all others did, that then his Burgesses should be readmitted,
otherwise they were to be utterly excluded as being spies rather than loyal
Burgesses, because they had offered themselves to be assistant at the mak-
ing of lawes which both themselves and those whom they represented might
chuse whether they would obaye or not.

Then came there in a complainte against Captain Martin, that having
sente his Shallop to trade for corne into the baye, under the commaunde
of one Ensigne Harrison, the saide Ensigne should affirme to one Thomas
Davis, of Paspaheighe, Gent. (as the said Thomas Davis deposed upon
oathe,) that they had made a harde voiage, had they not mett with a Canoa
coming out of a creeke where their shallop could not goe. For the Indians
refusing to sell their Corne, those of the shallop entered the Canoa with
their armes and tooke it by force, measuring out the eorne with a baskett
they had into the Shallop and (as the said Ensigne Harrison saith) giving
them satisfaction in copper beades and other trucking stuffe.

Hitherto Mr. Davys upon his oath.

Furthermore it was signified from Opochancano to the Governour that
those people had complained to him to procure them justice. For which
considerations and because suche outrages as this might breede danger and
loss of life to others of the Colony which should have leave to trade in the
baye hereafter, and for prevention of the like violenees against the In-
dians in time to come, this order following was agreed on by the general
assembly:

A second order against Captain Martin, at James cttty, July 80, 1619.

It was also ordered by tlie Assembly the same day in case Captaine Martin
and the ging of his shallop would not thoroughly answere an accusation of
an outrage committed gainst a certaine Conoa of Indians in the haye, that
then it was thought reason (his Patent notwithstanding, the authority
whereof he had in that case abused) he should from henceforth take leave
of the Governour as other men, and should putt in security, that his people
shall comitte no such outrage any more.

158 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

Upon this a letter or warrant was drawen in the name of the whole as-
sembly to sumon Captaine Martin to appeare before them in the forme
following:

By the Governour and general assembly of Virginia.

Captaine Martine, we are to request you upon sight hereof, with all con-
venient speed to repair hither to James citty to treatt and conferre with us
about some matters of especial importance which concerns both us and the
whole Colony [and] yourself. And of this we praye you not to faile,
James citty, July 30, 1619.

To our very loving friend, Captain John Martin, Esquire, Master of the
ordinance.

These obstacles removed, the Speaker, who for a long time has bene ex-
treame sickly, and therefore not able to passe through long harangues,
delivered in briefe to the whole assembly the occasions of their meeting.
Which done he read unto them the commission for establishing the Counsell
of Estate and the general Assembly, wherein their duties were described
to the life.

Having thus prepared them he read over unto them the greate Charter,
or commission of privileges, orders and laws, sent by Sir George Yeardley
out of Englande. Which for the more ease of the Committies, having
divided into fower books, he read the former two the same forenoon for
expeditions sake, a second time over, and so they were referred to the
perusall of twoe Committies, which did reciprocally consider of either, and
accordingly brought in their opinions. But some may here objecte to what
ende we should presume to referre that to the examination of Committies
which the Counsell and Company in England had already resolved to be
perfect, and did expect nothing but our assente thereunto. To this we
answere, that we did it not to the ende to correcte or controll anything
therein contained, but onely in case we should finde ought not perfectly
squaring with the state of this Colony or any lawe which did presse or
binde too harde, that we might by waye of humble petition, seeke to have
it redressed, especially because this great Charter is to bind us and our
heyers for ever.

The names of the Comnitities for perusing the first booke of the fower?

1. Captain William Powell, 2. Ensigne Rosingham,
3. Captaine Warde, 4, Captaine Tucker,
5. Mr. Shelley, 6. Thomas Douse,
7. Samuel Jordan, 8. Mr. Boys.
The names of the Committies for perusing the second booke:
1, Captaine Lawne, 2. Captaine Graves,
3. Ensigne Spense, 4, Samuel Sharpe,
5. William Cap, 6. Mr. Pawlett,
7. Mr. Jefferson, 8. Mr. Jaekson,

These Committies thus appointed, we brake up the first forenoon’s
assembly.

After dinner the Governour and those that were not of the Committies
sate a second time, while the said Committies were employed in the perusall
of those twoe bookes. And whercas the Speaker had propounded fower
severall objects for the Assembly to consider on: namely, first the great
charter of orders, lawes and privileges; Secondly, which of the instructions
given by the Counsel in England to my Lo: La: warre, Captain Argall
or Sir George Yeardley, might conveniently putt on the habite of lawes;
Thirdly, what lawes might issue out of the private conceipte of any of the
Burgesses, or any other of the Colony; and lastly, what petitions were
fitt to be sente home for England. It pleased the Governour for expedition
sake to have the second objecte of the fower to be examined and prepared
by himselfe and the Non-Committies. Wherein after having spentc some
three howers conference, the twoe Committies brought in their opinions
concerning the twoe former bookes, (the second of which beginneth at
these wordes of the charter; And forasmuche as our intente is to establish
one equall and uniforme kinde of government over all Virginia &c.,) which
the whole Assembly, because it was late, deferred to treatt of till the next
morning.
Satturday, July 81.

The nexte daye, therefore, out of the opinions of the said Committies, it
was agreed, these Petitions ensuing should be framed, to be presented to
the Treasurer, Counsel and Company in England. Upon the Committies
160 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

perusall of the first book, the Generall Assembly doe become most humble
suitors to their lo®* and to the rest of that honble Counsell and renowned
Company, that albeit they have bene pleased to allotte unto the Governo’
to themselves, together with the Counsell of Estate here, and to the
officers of Incorporations, certain lande portions of lande to be layde out
within the limites of the same, yet that they woulde vouchsafe also, that
groundes as heretofore had bene granted by patent to the antient Planters
by former Governours that had from the Company received comission so
to doe, might not nowe after so muche labour and coste, and so many
yeares habitation be taken from them. And to the ende that no man might
doe or suffer any wrong in this kinde, that they woulde favour us so muche
(if they meane to graunte this our petition) as to sende us notice, what
comission or authority for graunting of landes they have given to eache
particular Governour in times paste.

The second petition of the General assembly framed by the Committies out
of the second book is. That the Treasurer and Company in England would
be pleased with as muche convenient speed as may be to sende men hither
to oceupie their landes belonging to the fower Incorporations, as well for
their owne behoofe and proflitt as for the maintenance of the Counsel of
Estate, who are nowe to their extream hindrance often drawen far from
their private busines and likewise that they will have a care to sende tenants
to the ministers of the fower Incorporations to manure their gleab, to the
intente that all allowance they have allotted them of 200 G. a yeare may
be more easily raised.

The thirde Petition humbly presented by this General Assembly to the
Treasurer, Counsell and Company is, that it may plainly be expressed in
the great Comission (as indeed it is not) that the antient Planters of both
sortes, viz., suche as before Sir Thomas Dales’ depart were come hither
upon their owne chardges, and suche also as were brought hither upon the
Companie’s coste, maye have their second, third and more divisions suc-
cessively in as lardge and free manner as any other Planters. Also that
they wilbe pleased to allowe to the male children, of them and of all others
begotten in Virginia, being the onely hope of a posterity, a single share a
piece, and shares for their issues or for themselves, because that in a newe
plantation it is not knowen whether man or woman be more necessary.
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 161

Their fourth Petition is to beseech the Treasurer, Counsell and Company
that they would be pleased to appoint a Sub-Treasurer here to coilecte
their rents, to the ende that the Inhabitants of this Colony be not tyed to
an impossibility of paying the same yearly to the Treasurer in England, and
that they would enjoine the said Sub-Treasurer not precisely according to
the letter of the Charter to exacte mony of us (whereof we have none at all,
as we have no minte), but the true value of the rente in comodity.

The fifte Petition is to beseeche the Treasurer, Counse'l and Company that,
towards the erecting of the University and Colledge, they will sende, when
they shall thinke it most convenient, workmen of al! sortes, fitt for that
purpose,

The sixte and laste is, they wilbe pleased to change the savage name of
Kiecowtan, and to give that Incorporation a new name.

These are the general Petitions drawen by the Comitties out of the two
former bookes which the whole general assembly in maner and forme above
sett downe doe most humbly offer up and present to the honourable con-
struction of the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England.

These petitions thus concluded on, those twoe Comitties broughte me a
reporte what they had observed in the two latter bookes, which was nothing
else but that the perfection of them was suche as that they could finde
nothing therein subject to exception, only the Governors particular opinion
to my selfe in private hathe bene as touching a clause in the thirde booke,
that in these doubtfull times between us and the Indians, it would behoove
us not to make as lardge distances between Plantation as ten miles, but for
our more strength ande security to drawe nearer together. At the same
time, there remaining no farther scruple in the mindes of the Assembly
touching the said great Charter of lawes, orders and priviledges, the Speaker
putt the same to the question, and so it had both the gencral assent and the
applause of the whole assembly, who, as they professed themselves in the
first place most submissively thankful to almighty god, therefore so they
commaunded the Speaker to returne (as nowe he doth) their due and hum-
ble thankes to the Treasurer Counsell and company for so many priviledges
and favours as well in their owne names as in the names of the who!e Colony
whom they represented.
162 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

This being dispatched we fell once more debating of suche instructions
given by the Counsell in England to several Governors as might be con-
verted into lawes, the last whereof was the Establishment of the price of
Tobacco, namely, of the best at 3d and the second at 18d the pounde.
At the reading of this the Assembly thought good to send for Mr. Abraham
Persey, the Cape marchant, to publishe this instruction to him, and to
demaunde of him if he knewe of any impediment why it might not be
admitted of? His answere was that he had not as yet received any suche
order from the Adventurers of the in England. And notwithstanding he
sawe the authority was good, yet was he unwilling to yield, till suche time
as the Governor and Assembly had layd their commandment upon him,
out of the authority of the foresaid Instructions as followeth:

By the General Assembly.

We will and require you, Mr. Abraham Persey, Cape Marchant, from this
daye forwarde to take notice, that, according to an article in the Instruc-
tions confirmed by the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in Englande at
a general quarter courte, both by voices and under their hands and the
Comon seall, and given to Sir George Yeardley, knight, this present
governour, Decemb. 3, 1618, that you are bounde to accepte of the Tobacco
of the Colony, either for commodities or upon billes, at three shillings the
beste and the second sorte at 18d the punde, and this shalbe your sufficient
dischardge.

James citty out of the said General Assembly, July 31, 1619.

At the same the Instructions convertible into lawes were referred to the
consideration of the above named Committies, viz., the general Instructions
to the first Committie and the particular Instructions to the second, to
be returned by them into the assembly on Munday morning.

Sunday, Aug. 1.
Mr. Shelley, one of the Burgesses, deceased.
Munday, Aug. 2.

Captain John Martin (according to the sumons sent him on Fryday,
July 30,) made his personall appearance at the barre, whenas the Speaker
having first read unto him the orders of the Assembly that concerned him,
JULY $0, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 163

he pleaded lardgely for himself to them both and indevoured to answere
some other thinges that were objected against his Patente. In fine,
being demanded out of the former order whether he would quitte that
clause of his Patent which (quite otherwise then Sir William Throck-
morton’s, Captain Christopher Lawnes and other men’s patentes) exempt-
eth himselffe and his people from all services of the Colonie excepte oncly
in case of warre against a forren or domesticall enemie, His answere was
negative, that he would not infringe any parte of his Patente. Where-
upon it was resolved by the Assembly that his Burgesses should have no
admittance.

To the second order his answere was affirmative, namely, that (his Patent
notwithstanding) whensoever he should send in to the baye to trade, he
would be contente to putt in security to the Governour for the good
behaviour of his people towardes the Indians.

It was at the same time further ordered by the Assembly that the Speaker,
in their names, should (as he nowe doth) humbly demaunde of the Treas-
urer, Counsell and Company an exposition of this one clause in Captaine
Martin’s Patente namely, where it is saide That he is to enjoye his landes
in as lardge and ample manner, to all intentes and purposes, as any lord
of any manours in England dothe holde his grounde out of which some
have collected that he might by the same graunte protecte men from
paying their debts and from diverse other dangers of lawe. The least
the Assembly can alledge against this clause is, that it is obscure, and that
it is a thing impossible for us here to knowe the Prerogatives of all manours
in Englande. The Assembly therefore humbly beseeches their lo?®* and
the rest of that Honble house that in case they shall finde any thing in
this or in any other parte of his graunte wherby that clause towards the
conclusion of the great charter, (viz., that all grauntes aswell of the one
sorte as of the other respectively, be made with equall favour, and graunts
of like liberties and imunities as neer as may be, to the ende that all com-
plainte of partiality and indifferency may be avoided,) might in any sorte
be contradicted or the uniformity and equality of lawes and orders extend-
ing over the whole Colony might be impeached, That they would be
pleased to remove any such hindrance as may diverte out of the true
course the free and publique current of Justice.
164 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

Upon the same ground and reason their lo?*, together with the rest of the
Counsell and Company, are humbly besought by this general assembly
that if in that other clause which exempteth the Captaine Martin and his
people from all services of the Colony ete., they shall finde any resistance
[to] that equality and uniformity of lawes and orders intended nowe by
them to be established over the whole Colony, that they would be pleased
to reforme it.

In fine, wheras Captaine Martin, for those ten shares allowed him for
his personal adventure and for his adventure of £70 besides, doth claim
500 acres a share, that the Treasurer, Counsell and Company woulde
vouchsafe to give notice to the Governour here, what kinde of shares
they meante he should have when they gave him his Patent.

The premisses about Captaine Martin thus resolved, the Committies
appointed to consider what instructions are fitt to be converted into lawes,
brought in their opinions, and first of some of the general instructions.

Here begin the lawes drawen out of the Instructions given by his Mat?
Counsell of Virginia in England to my lo: la warre, Captain Argall
and Sir George Yeardley, knight.

By this present General Assembly be it enacted that no injury or oppres-
sion be wrought by the English against the Indians whereby the present
peace might be disturbed and antient quarrells might be revived. And
farther be it ordained that the Chicohomini are not to be excepted out of
this lawe; untill either that suche order come out of Englande or that
they doe provoke us by some newe injury.

Against Idienes, Gaming, drunkenes and excesse in apparell the Assembly
hath enacted as followeth:

First, in detestation of Idlenes be it enacted, that if any man be founde to
live as an Idler or renagate, though a freedman, it shalbe lawful for that
Incorporation or Plantation to which he belongeth to appoint him a Mr to
serve for wages, till he shewe apparant signes of amendment.

Against gaming at dice and Cardes be it ordained by this present assembly
that the winner or winners shall lose all his or their winninges and both
winners and loosers shall forfaite ten shillings a man, one ten shillings
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 165

whereof to go to the discoverer, and the rest to charitable and pious uses
in the Incorporation where the faulte is comitted.

Against drunkenness be it also decreed that if any private person be found
culpable thereof, for the first time he is to be reprooved privatcly by the
Minister, the second time publiquely, the thirde time to lye in boltes 12
howers in the house of the Provost Marshall and to paye his fee, and if
he still continue in that vice, to undergo suche severe punishment as the
Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to be inflicted on him.
But if any officer offende in this crime, the first time he shall receive reprootf
from the Governour, the second time he shall openly be reprcoved in the
churehe by the minister, and the third time he shall first be comitted and
then degraded. Provided it be understood that the Governor hath alwayes
power to restore him when he shall in his discretion thinke fitte.

Against excesse in apparell that every man be cessed in the churche for
all publique contributions, if he be unmarried according to his owne
apparell, if he be married, aceording to his owne and his wives, or either
of their apparell.

As touching the instruction of drawing some of the better disposed of the
Indians to converse with our people and to live and labour amongst
them, the Assembly who knowe well their dispositions thinke it fitte to
enjoin, least to counsell those of the Colony, neither utterly to reject them
nor yet to drawe them to come in. But in case they will of themselves
come voluntarily to places well peopled, there to doe service in killing of
Deere, fishing, beatting of Corne and other workes, that then five or six may
be admitted into every such place, and no more, and that with the consente
of the Governour. Provided that good guarde in the night be kept upon
them for generally (though some amongst many may proove good) they
are a most trecherous people and quickly gone when they have done a
villany. And it were fitt a house were builte for them to lodge in aparte
by themselves, and lone inhabitants by no meanes to entertain them.

Be it enacted by this present assembly that for laying a surer foundation
of the conversion of the Indians to Christian Religion, eache towne,
citty, Borrough, and particular plantation do obtaine unto themselves by
just means a certine number of the natives’ children to be educated by
166 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

them in true religion and civile course of life—of which children the most
towardly boyes in witt and graces of nature to be brought up by them in
the first elements of litterature, so to be fitted for the Colledge intended for
them that from thence they may be sente to that worke of conversion.

As touching the busines of planting corne this present Assembly doth
ordain that yeare by yeare all and every householder and householders
have in store for every servant he or they shall keep, and also for his or
their owne persons, whether they have any Servants or no, one spare barrell
of corne, to be delivered out yearly, either upon sale or exchange as need
shall require. For the neglecte of which duty he shalbe subjecte to the
censure of the Governor and Counsell of Estate. Provided always that
the first yeare of every newe man this lawe shall not be of force.

About the plantation of Mulbery trees, be it enacted that every man as
he is seatted upon his division, doe for seven yeares together, every yeare
plante and maintaine in growte six Mulberry trees at the least, and as many
more as he shall think conveniente and as his vurtue and Industry shall
move him to plante, and that all suche persons as shall negleete the yearly
planting and maintaining of that small proportion shalbe subjecte to the
censure of the Governour and the Counsell of Estate.

Be it farther enacted as concerning Silke-flaxe, that those men that are
upon their division or setled habitation doe this next yeare plante and
dresse 100 plantes, which being founde a comodity, may farther be in-
creased. And whosoever do faill in the performance of this shalbe subject
to the punishment of the Governour and Counsell of Estate.

For hempe also both English and Indian and for English flax and
Anniseeds, we do require and enjoine all householders of this Colony that
have any of those seeds to make tryal thereof the nexte season.

Moreover be it enacted by this present Assembly, that every householder
doe yearly plante and maintaine ten vines untill they have attained to the
art and experience of dressing a Vineyard either by their owne industry or
by the Instruction of some Vigneron. And that upon what penalty soever
the Governor and Counsell of Estate shall thinke fitt to impose upon
the neglecters of this acte.
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 167

Be it also enacted that all necessary tradesmen, or so many as need shall
require, suche as are come over since the departure of Sir Thomas Dale,
or that shall hereafter come, shall worke at their trades for any other man,
each one being payde according to the quality of his trade and worke, to be
estimated, if he shall not be contented, by the Governor and officers of the
place where he worketh.

Be it further ordained by this General Assembly, and we doe by these
presents enacte, that all contractes made in England between the owners
of the lande and their Tenants and Servantes which they shall sende
hither, may be caused to be duely performed, and that the offenders be
punished as the Governour and Counsell of Mstate shall thinke Just and
convenient.

Be it established also by this present Assembly that no crafty or advanta-
gious means be suffered to be put in practise for the inticing awaye the
Tenants or Servants of any particular plantation from the place where
they are seatted. And that it shalbe the duty of the Governor and Coun-
sell of Estate most severely to punish both the seducers and the seduced,
and to returne these latter into their former places.

Be it further enacted that the orders for the Magazin lately made be
exactly kepte, and that the Magazin be preserved from wrong and sinister
practises, and that according to the orders of courte in Englande all To-
baeco and sasafras be brought by the Planters to the Cape marchant till
suche time as all the goods nowe or heretofore sent for the Magazin be
taken off their hands at the prices agreed on. That by this meanes the
same going for Englande with one hande the price thercof may be uphelde
the better. And to that ende that all the whole Colony may take notice
of the last order of Courte made in Engiande and all those whom it con-
cerneth may knowe howe to observe it, we holde it fitt to publishe it here
for a lawe among the rest of our lawes. ‘The which order is as followeth:

Upon the 26 of October, 1618, it was ordered that the Magazin should
continue during the terme formerly prefixed and that certaine abuses now
complained of should be reformed and that for preventing of all Imposi-
tions save the allowance of 25 in the hundred proffitt, the Governor shall
have an invoice as well as the Cape Marchant, that if any abuse in the
sale of the goods be offered, wee upon Intelligence and due examination
168 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

thereof, shall see it correctede. And for incouragement of particular
hundreds, as Smythe’s hundred, Martin’s hundred, Lawnes’ hundred, and
the like, it is agreed that what comodoties are reaped upon anie of these
General Colonies, it shalbe lawefull for them to returne the same to their
owne adventurers. Provided that the same comodity be of their owne
growing, without trading with any other, in one entyre lumpe, and not
dispersed and that at the determination of the jointe stocke, the goods then
remaining in the Magazin shalbe bought by the said particular Colonies
before any other goods which shall be sente by private men. And it was
moreover ordered that if the lady la warre, the Lady Dale, Captain Bar-
grave and the rest, would unite themselves into a settled Colony they
might be capable of the same priviledges that are graunted to any of the
foresaid hundreds. Hitherto the order.

All the general Assembly by voices concluded not only the acceptance
and observation of this order, but of the Instruction also to Sir George
Yeardley next preceding the same. Provided first, that the Cape Mar-
chant do aceepte of the Tobacco of all and everie the Planters here in
Virginia, either for Goods or upon billes of Exchange at three shillings the
pounde the beste, and 18d the second sorte. Provided also that the billes
be only payde in Englande. Provided, in the third place, that if any other
besides the Magazin have at any time any necessary comodity which the
Magazine dothe wante, it shall and may be lawfull for any of the Colony
to buye the said necessary comodity of the said party, but upon the termes
of the Magazin viz: allowing no more gaine then 25 in the hundred, and
that with the leave of the Governour. Provided lastly, that it may be
lawfull for the Governor to give leave to any Mariner, or any other person
that shall have any suche necessary comodity wanting to the Magazin to
carrie home for Englande so muche Tobaceo or other naturall comodities
of the Country as his Customers shall pay him for the said necessary
comodity or comodities. And to the ende we may not only persuade and
incite men, but inforce them also thoroughly and loyally to aire their
Tobacco before they bring it to the Magazine, be it enacted, and by these
presents we doe enacte, that if upon the Judgement of fower sufficient
men of any incorporation where the Magazine shall reside, (having first
taken their oaths to give true sentence, twoe whereof to be chosen by the
Cape Marchant and twoe by the Incorporation), any Tobacco whatsoever
JULY 80, 81, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 169

shall not proove vendible at the second price, that it shall there imediately
be burnt before the owner’s face. Hitherto suche lawes as were drawen
out of the Instructions.

Tuesday, Aug. 8, 1619.

This morning a thirde sorte of lawes (suche as might proceed out of
every man’s private conceipt) were read and referred by halves to the same
comitties which were from the beginning.

This done, Captaine William Powell presented to the Assembly a petition
to have justice against a lewde and trecherous servante of his who
by false accusation given up in writing to the Governor sought not only
to gett him deposed from his government of James citty and utterly
(according to the Proclamation) to be degraded from the place and title
of a Captaine, but to take his life from him also. And so out of the said
Petition sprang this order following:

Captaine William Powell presented a pettition to the general! Assem-
bly against one Thomas Garnett, a servant of his, not onely for extreame
neglect of his business to the great loss and prejudice of the said Captaine,
and for openly and impudently abusing his house, in sight both of Master
and Mistress, through wantonnes with a woman servant of theirs, a wid-
dowe, but also for falsely accusing him to the Governor both of Drunken-
nes and Thefte, and besides for bringing all his fellow servants to testific
on his side, wherein they justly failed him. It was thought fitt by the
general assembly (the Governour himself giving sentence), that he should
stand fower dayes with his eares nayled to the Pillory, viz: Wednesday,
Aug. 4th, and so ikewise Thursday, fryday, and Satturday next following,
and every of those dayes should be publiquely whipped. Now, as touch-
ing the neglecte of his worke, what satisfaction ought to be made to his Mr
for that is referred to the Governour and Counsell of Estate.

The same morning the lawes abovewritten, drawen out of the instruc-
tions, were read, and one by onc thoroughly examined, and then passed
once again the general consente of the whole Assembly.

This afternoon the comitties brought in a reporte, what they had done as
concerning the thirde sorte of Jawes, the discussing whereof spente the
residue of that daye. Excepte onely the consideration of a peititon of
170 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

Mr. John Rolfes againste Captaine John Martine for writing a letter to
him wherein (as Mr. Rolfe alledgeth) he taxeth him both unseemly and
amisse of certaine thinges wherein he was never faulty, and besides, casteth
some aspersion upon the present government, which is the most temperate
and juste that ever was in this country, too milde indeed, for many of this
Colony, whom unwoonted liberty hath made insolente and not to know
themselves. This Petition of Mr. Rolfes’ was thought fitt to be referred
to the Counsell of State.

Wednesday, Aug. 4th.

This daye (by reason of extream heat, both paste and likely to ensue and
by that meanes of the alteration of the healthes of diverse of the
general Assembly) the Governour, who himself also was not well, resolved
should be the last of this first session; so in the morning the Speaker (as he
was required by the Assembly) redd over ali the lawes and orders that had
formerly passed the house, to give the same yett one reviewe more, and to
see whether there were any thing to be amended or that might be excepted
againste. This being done, the third sorte of lawes which I am nowe
coming to sett downe, were read over [and] thoroughly discussed, which,
together with the former, did now passe the laste and finall consente of the
General Assembly.

A thirde sorte of lawes, suche as may issue out of every man’s private conceipte.

It shalbe free for every man to trade with the Indians, servants onely
excepted, upon paine of whipping, unless the Mr. will redeeme it off with
the payment of an Angell, one-fourth parte whereof to go to the Provost
Marshall one fourth parte to the discoverer, and the other moyty to the
publique uses of the Incorporation.

That no man doe sell or give any of the greatter howes to the Indians,
or any English dog of quality, as a mastive, greyhound, bloodhounde, lande
or water spaniel, or any other dog or bitche whatsoever, of the Englishe
race, upon paine of forfaiting 5s sterling to the publique uses of the Incor-
poration where he dwelleth.

That no man do sell or give any Indians any piece shott or poulder, or
any other armes, offensive or defensive upon paine of being held a
JULY 80, 31, AUGUST 2, 3, 4, 1619 Tl

Traytour to the Colony, and of being hanged as soon as the facte is proved,
without all redemption.

That no man may go above twenty miles from his dwelling-place, nor
upon any voiage whatsoever shalbe absent from thence for the space of
seven dayes together without first having made the Governor or comaunder
of the same place acquainted therwith, upon paine of paying twenty
shillings to the publique uses of the same Incorporation where the party
delinquent dwelleth.

That no man shall purposely goe to any Indian townes, habitations or
places or resortes without leave from the Governor or comaunder of
that place wher he liveth, upon paine of paying 40s to publique uses as
aforesaid.

That no man living in this Colony, but shall between this and the first
of January nexte ensueing come or sende to the Secretary of state to
enter his own and all his servants’ names, and for what terme or upon what
conditions they are to serve, upon penalty of paying 40s to the said Secre-
tary of Estate. Also, whatsoever M*™ or people doe come over to this
plantation that within one month of their arrivall (notice being first given
them of this very lawe) they shall likewise resorte to the Secretary of
Estate and shall certifie him upon what termes or conditions they be come
hither, to the ende that he may recorde their grauntes and comissions, and
for how long time and upon what conditions their servants (in case they
have any) are to serve them, and that upon paine of the penalty nexte
above mentioned.

All Ministers in the Colony shall once a year, namely, in the moneth of
Marche, bring to the Secretary of Estate a true account of all Christenings,
burials and marriages, upon paine, if they faill, to be censured for their
negligence by the Governor and Counsell of Estate; likewise, where there
be no ministers, that the comanders of the place doe supply the same duty.

No man, without leave of the Governor, shall kill any Neatt cattle
whatsoever, young or olde, especially kine, Heyfurs or cow-calves, and
shalbe careful to perserve their steers and oxen, and to bring them to the
plough and such profitable uses, and without having obtained leave as
172 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

aforesaid, shall not kill them, upon penalty of forfaiting the value of the
beast so killed.

Whosoever shall take any of his neighbors’ boates, oares, or canoas
without leave from the owner shalbe helde and esteemed as a felon and so
proceeded againste; tho hee that shall take away by violence or stelth any
canoas or other thinges from the Indians shall make valuable restitution
to the said Indians, and shall forfaict, if he be a freeholder, five pound;
if a servant, 40s, or endure a whipping; and anything under the value of
13d shall be accounted Petty larcency.

All ministers shall duely read divine service, and exercise their min-
isterial function according to the Ecclesiastical lawes and orders of the
churche of Englande, and every Sunday in the afternoon shall Catechize
suche as are not yet ripe to come to the Com. And whosoever of them
shalbe found negligent or faulty in this kinde shalbe subject to the censure
of the Governor and Counsell of Estate.

The Ministers and Churehwardens shall seeke to presente all ungodly
disorders, the comitters wherofe if, upon goode admonitions and milde
reproofi, they will not forbeare the said skandalous offenses, as suspicions
of whordomes, dishonest company keeping with weomen and suche like,
they are to be presented and punished accordingly.

If any person after two warnings, doe not amende his or her life in
point of evident suspicion of Incontiney or of the comission of any other
enormous sinnes, that then he or shee be presented by the Churchwardens
and suspended for a time from the churche by the minister. In which
Interim if the same person do not amende and humbly submit him or her-
self to the churche, he is then fully to be excomunicate and soon after a
writt or warrant to be sent from the Governor for the apprehending of
his person ande seizing on all his goods. Provided alwayes, that all the
ministers doe meet once a quarter, namely, at the feast of St. Michael the
Arkangell, of the nativity of our saviour, of the Annuntiation of the blessed
Virgine, and about midsomer, at James citty or any other place where the
Governor shall reside, to determine whom it is fitt to exeomunicate, and
that they first presente their opinion to the Governor ere they proceed to
the acte of excomuniecation.
JULY 30, 81, AUGUST 2, 3, 4, 1619 173

For the reformation of swearing, every freeman and Mr. of a family
after thrise admontion shall give 5s or the value upon present demaunde,

No man whatsoever, coming by water from above, as from Henrico,
Charles citty, or any place from the westwarde of James citty, and being
bound for Kiccowtan, or any other parte on this side, the same shall pre-
sume to pass by, either by day or by night, without touching firste here at
James citty to knowe whether the Governor will comande him any service.
And the like shall they performe that come from Kicawtan ward, or from
any place between this and that, to go upwarde, upon paine of forfaiting
ten pound sterling a time to the Governor. Provided, that if a servant
having had instructions from his Master to observe this lawe, doe not-
withstanding, transgresse the same, that then the said servant shalbe pun-
ished at the Governor’s discretion; otherwise, that the master himselfe
shall undergo the foresaid penalty.

No man shall trade into the baye, either in shallop, pinnaee, or ship, with-
out the Governor's license, and without putting in security that neither
himself nor his Company shall force or wrong the Indians, upon paine that,
doing otherwise, they shalbe censured at their returne by the Governor
and Counsell of Estate.

All persons whatsoever upon the Sabaoth daye shall frequente divine
service and sermons both forenoon and afternoon, and all suche as beare
armes shall bring their pieces swordes, poulder and shotte. And every one
that shall transgresse this lawe shall forfaicte three shillinges a time to the
use of the churche, all lawful and necessary impediments excepted. But

128233 —18
174 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

or contracte any suche persons without some of the foresaid consentes
shalbe subjecte to the severe censure of the Governor and Counsell of
Estate.

Be it enacted by this present assembly that whatsoever servant hath
heretofore or shall hereafter contracte himselfe in England, either by way
of Indenture or otherwise, to serve any Master here in Virginia and shall
afterward, against his said former contracte depart from his Mr without
leave, or, being once imbarked shall abandon the ship he is appointed to
come in, and so, being lefte behinde, shall putt himselfe into the service of
any other man that will bring him hither, that then at the same servant’s
arrival here, he shall first serve out his time with that Mr that brought
him hither and afterward also shall serve out his time with his former Mr
according to his covenant.

Here ende the lawes.

All these lawes being thus concluded and consented to as aforesaid
Captaine Henry Spellman was called to the barre to answere to certaine
misdemeanors layde to his chardge by Robert Poole, interpretour, upon
his oath (whose examination the Governor sente into England in the
Prosperus), of which accusations of Poole some he acknowledged for true,
but the greattest part he denyed. Whereupon the General Assembly
having throughly heard and considered his speaches, did constitute this
order following against him:

Aug. 4th, 1619.

This day Captaine Henry Spelman was convented before the General
Assembly and was examined by a relation upon oath of one Robert Poole,
Interpreter, what conference had passed between the said Spelman and
Opochaneano at Poole’s meeting with him in Opochancano’s courte.
Poole chardgeth him he spake very unreverently and maliciously against
this present Governor, whereby the honour and dignity of his place and
person, and so of the whole Colonie, might be brought into contempte, by
which meanes what mischiefs might ensue from the Indians by disturbance
of the peace or otherwise, may easily be conjectured. Some thinges of
this relation Spelman confessed, but the most parte he denyed, excepte
onely one matter of importance, and that was that he hade informed
JULY 80, 31, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 175

Opochancano that within a yeare there would come a Governor greatter
then this that nowe isin place. By which and by other reportes it seemeth
he hath alienated the minde of Opochancano from this present Governour,
and brought him in much disesteem, both with Opochancano and the
Indians, and the whole Colony in danger of their slippery designes.

The general assembly upon Poole’s testimony onely not willing to putt
Spelman to the rigour and extremity of the !awe which might, perhaps both
speedily and deservedly, have taken his life from him (upon the witness of
one whom he muche excepted against) were pleased, for the present, to
censure him rather out of that his confession above written then out of
any other prooffe. Several and sharpe punishments were pronounced
against him by diverse of the Assembly, But in fine the whole courte by
voices united did encline to the most favorable, which was that for this
misdemeanour he should first be degraded of his title of Captaine, at the
head of the troupe, and should be condemned to performe seven years
service to the Colony in the nature of Interpreter to the Governour.

This sentence being read to Spelman he, as one that had in him more
of the Savage then of the Christian, muttered certaine wordes to himselfe
neither shewing any remorse for his offenses, nor yet any thankfulness to
the Assembly for theire sofavourable censure, which he at one time or
another (God’s grace not wholly abandoning him) might with some one
service have been able to have redeemed.

This day also did the Inhabitants of Paspaheigh, alias Argall’s towne,
present a petition to the general assembly to give them an absolute dis-
charge from certain bondes wherein they stand bound to Captain Samuell
Argall for the payment of 600’ and to Captain William Powell, at Captaine
Argall’s appointment, for the payment of 50'" more. To Captaine Argall
for 15 skore acres of wooddy ground, called by the name of Argal’s towne
or Paspaheigh; to Captaine Powell in respect of his paines in clearing the
grounde and building the houses, for which Captaine Argal ought to have
given him satisfaction. Nowe, the general assembly being doubtful
whether they have any power and authority to discharge the said bondes,
doe by these presents (at the Instance of the said Inhabitants of Pas-
paheigh, alias Martin’s hundred people) become most humble sutours to
176 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

the Treasurer, Counsell and Company in England that they wilbe pleased
to gett the said bondes for 600!” to be cancelled; forasmuche as in their
great comission they have expressly and by name appointed that place of
Paspaheigh for parte of the Governour’s lande. And whereas Captain
William Powell is payde his 50 which Captain Argall enjoined the saide
Inhabitantes to presente him with, as parte of the bargaine, the general
assembly, at their intreaty, do become sutours on their behalfe, that
Captaine Argall, by the Counsell and Company in England, may be com-
pelled either to restore the said 50'” from thence, or else that restitution
thereof be made here out of the goods of the said Captaine Argall.

The last acte of the Generall Assembly was a contribution to gratifie their
oiticers, as followeth:
Aug. 4th, 1619.

It is fully agreed at this general Assembly that in regard of the great
paines and labour of the Speaker of this Assembly (who not onely first
formed the same Assembly and to their great case and expedition reduced
all matters to be treatted of into a ready method, but also his indisposition
notwithstanding wrote or dictated all orders and other expedients and is
yet to write severall bookes for all the Generall Incorporations and planta-
tions both of the great charter, and of all the lawes) and likewise in respecte
of the diligence of the Clerke and sergeant, officers thereto belonging,
That every man and manservant of above 16 yeares of age shall pay into
the handes and Custody of the Burgesses of every Incorporation and
plantation one pound of the best Tobacco, to be distributed to the Speaker
and likewise to the Clerke and sergeant of the Assembly, according to
their degrees and rankes, the whole bulke whereof to be delivered into the
Speaker’s handes, to be divided accordingly. And in regarde the Provost
Marshall of James citty hath also given some attendance upon the said
General Assembly, he is also to have a share out of the same. And this is
to begin to be gathered the 24th of February nexte.

In conclusion, the whole Assembly comaunded the Speaker (as nowe
he doth) to present their humble excuse to the Treasurer Counsell and
Company in England for being constrained by the intemperature of the
weather and the falling sick of diverse of the Burgesses to breake up so
abruptly—before they had so much as putt their lawes to the ingrossing.
JULY 30, 31, AUGUST 2, 8, 4, 1619 177

This they wholly comited to the fidelity of their speaker, who therin
(his conscience telles him) hath done the parte of an honest man, otherwise
he would be easily founde out by the Burgesses themselves, who with all
expedition are to have so many bookes of the same lawes as there be both
Incorporations and Plantations in the Colony.

In the seconde place, the Assembly doth most humbly crave pardon
that in so shorte a space they could bring their matter to no more perfec-
tion, being for the present enforced to sende home titles rather then lawes,
Propositions rather then resolutions, Attemptes then Acchievements,
hoping their courtesy will accepte our poor endevour, and their wisedome
wilbe ready to supporte the weakness of this little flocke.

Thirdly, the General Assembly doth humbly beseech the said Treas-
urer, Counsell and Company, that albeit it belongeth to them onely to
allowe or to abrogate any lawes which we shall here make, and that it is
their right so to doe, yet that it would please them not to take it in ill parte
if these lawes which we have now brought to light, do passe currant and
be of force till suche time as we may knowe their farther pleasure out of
Englande: for otherwise this people (vho nowe at length have gotten the
raines of former servitude into their owne swindge) would in shorte time
growe so insolent, as they would shake off all government, and there would
be no living among them.

Their last humble suite is, that the said Counsell and Company would
be pleased, so soon as they shall finde it convenient, to make good their
promise sett downe at the conclusion of their commission for establishing
the Counsel of Estate and the General Assembly, namely, that they will
give us power to allowe or disallowe of their orders of Courte, as his
Majesty hath given them power to allowe or to reject our lawes.

In sume Sir George Yeardley, the Governour prorogued the said
General Assembly till the firste of Marche, which is to fall out this present
yeare of 1619, and in the mean season dissolved the same.

Good Mr fferrar: I came by S" Nicolas Tufton: & brought along wt me
seven good men, w* 8S" Nicolas had very carefully provided for us. But
at my coming to Northborn on Wendsday the 11% of this present, I found
the Ship gone the day before. I found also som letters to me out of the
Ship: w*" gave me no great content, conceiving they wanted som of o°
number appointed, & yet were unwilling to take anie more in. And as
for Nicolas Tufton, they sent not to him at all. But perceiving by my
men, that after the writing of those letters, that had taken in those five
w* we sent to them in the Sandwich bote; & other two wt my folk had
here provided; & hearing also that they had got a good pilote out of the
Kings Ships, (for at Sandwich they could get none); & that at their setting
of Saile, w was on Tuesday at noone, they wanted but one of their
complete number of six score: I must confesse I was then not a little
comforted: but much more, & more again everie day since, the wynd
having continued here so constantly prosperous. I hope verily by this
they are on a quarter of their way. What had they been, if they had not
lost those two days at the custome House? I trust the blessing of God
is wt us in this Action: & then will we not feare what the Devill can
woork against it. I disbursed Ten shillings amongst those seven: w‘ w'?

their enterteinment at my house gave them reasonable content, & they
have promised to be readie against another voiage.

I merveil we heare not yet of the Diana from the Ile of Wight, unles this
north-east wynd have stopt hir there.

I have taken good order for y°™ supplie wt monie. Before the end of

cause M' Carter to procure a warrent to me from the Committies for
o' Smiths Hundred, for paying for the transportation of o* 42. persons
in this Ship: (ffor so manie set to Sea, though five dyed in the way:) w
cometh to 252' at 6' the person. The payment for those in the Magazin
Ship, y" knowe is respited by their consent, till other reckonings be cleared:
wt will not be now till o* meeting the next term. I have spent this after-
noon wholy in writing of letters: & reserved y°™ to the last; so that now
I growe wearie, & the night is far spent. I shall long to heare from y*
& what nues by the Diana. Y" made me half a promise to visit us at
Northborn: I pray y” perfit it in y™ next letter; & set me down the
tyme when my gelding wt a footman shall at Gravesend attend y*.

{1>] Right Honorable

Beeing advertized of y L** return to London, it trowbled me much
that I could not sodainly wayt upon y* L*: beeing detained here by
a coorse of physick, imposed upon ke §me§ for som tyme, yet; in
way of prevention. I am also put in som hope & expectance, that
my L. of Doncaster wilbe pleased to take my house in his way: at w
tyme I should be exeeeding §very§ loth to be absent, beeing so much
beholden to his L? as I am. Mean tyme I am, & have §& wilbe§ been
carefull, that there shewld be no §defect§ neglect found in o° Virginia
busines. The chief whereof is now, the paying of mariners wages, &
fraight of Ships returned: w* is all welt performed by my Shonest§ faithfa
& carefull Deputie; whom I have furnished for that purpose w* §above§
One Thousand pounds & upward; so that all men have been satisfyed
iustly at their days. Only one thing dooth much perplex me, wherein I
shalbe bold to crave sem Direction from y L’. The Governot 8" George
Yeardley, having taken exceeding pains for the setling of al things
§matters§ in order in Virginia, & for laying the foundation of a regular
State, according to his Instructions & other Directions; hath sodainly
fallen into a violent resolution of quitting his Place, (grounding himself
upon an erro’,) & ceaseth not by all his letters publick & private to impor-
tune it. The erro is, that he conceiveth St Thomas Smyth still to be
Treasuro’, w" his Alderman Deputie: & supposeth that he shalbe there

the Subiect of their malignancie, & so as to be wronged & disgraced by
them in his place & actions §be his Industrie & Integritie never so great§
S Th Smyth was highly offended w* his §8S" George Yeardleys being$
knighted: aleging that §it§ beeing doon contrarie to his pleasure, yet both
his name; & the whole companies name, were used in it §either§ whereof
{in truth] was so. Before St Georges Departure, I both labored & effected
a Reconciliation, (thinking it very unfitt that the Treasuro’ of the Com-
panie, & the Governo' of the Colonie, should be at Variance: & mutual
offices of love §& frendship§ & adres did passt on bothe sides. After
S* Georges §was gone§ departure; I §perceived§$ sae my woork to be
unsound. ffor upon occasion of a motion made epenby against 8" G.
Yeardley by a noble person in faye? as §contemplation as seemed§ wes con-
eeived of Captain Argall, St Thomas taking the advantage renued his
former [24] displeasure; not long after upbraiding again in open coort his
unduely procured Knighthood: Mt Canning also muttering e## matter of
disgrace b¥ §to§ his wife: & this against a man, to whom they §had§
professed frendship, §who was§ chosen by themselves, & sent §by them
(in great part at his own private charges)§$ to so difficult a service. The
report hereof coming (as dooth now appeare) to 8" G Yeardley, (for his
owne brother was present), hath bred in him this discontent, & hastie
resolution, not to serve under his controll, whose hatred §though causeles§
was so strong, as to break thorough the §nue§ bounds of a publick reecon-
ciliation. Yet he offereth, that beeing dismissed of the place of Governo’,
he will continue in that Contrie, & prosecute w** all eare oT Smiths Hundred
busines. w in partieular for o* Societie were a matter of much benefit:
but the well carrying of the publick is of more importance. To the setting
up whereof, we have this yeare alredy sent three Fifties of persons: One
in Januarie wt" S' G. Yeardley, for the Governo's land: & the other two
now lately, for the College & Companies lands. There were also in March
last 20. sent for the Companies land in Captain Lawns Ship: & 4. in the
Triall: & about 10. more for the publick wilbe recovered in the Contrie.
My Desire is to make those Fifties up so manie Hundreds, to be sent
away in the end of Januarie next. To w purpose I cast about for supplie
of monie: & am in good hope to bring it to effect. I suppose there is no
man that knoweth the Contrie, but will easily acknowlege, that the profit
of the labo's of these three hundred mes §once setled§, redounding equally
218 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

to the Governour, College, & Companie, can be esteemed at no lesse then
a Thousand pounds a yeare to each; & I hope §in som short tyme§ double
that sum. w wilbe a fair ground §whereon§ to reedifie that state: &
w, if §former$ my persuasions had taken anie place, had not been now
to doo for the Governo' & Companie. But this my good L. cannot be
doon w*out great charge. w*" causeth the w'tdrawing of publick monie
out of private mens hands: whence riseth this name of Accounts, so
mortally hated.

I had thought that no man, carrying the face of an honest man, could
have been displeased wt* beeing called to an Account: beeing the onlie
iustification & discharge of a true man. But it $hath§ fallen out other-
wise. In steed of thanks for my labo’, I have reaped a masse of malignitie:
under w*" (had it not been by the help ef yo" Lr* §noble§ Justice) I might
have quailed. But in affiance of §the blessing of God first & next off
the continuance ef y™ Le §Constancie§ geed fave", I will not faint in
§persisting to goo on to§ dooime that, wtout w thts woork can not be
doon. But touching St George Yeardley, the assurance w™ I gave of his
faithfulnes, Sexperience§ henest eave suffieiencie & industrie, dooth cause me
§much§ to desire it exeeedinely that the woork w*' in my yeare dooth moove
from hence, may passe on §unte§ under to his hands to be the establing of
§there§ established ef it there: Men of greater place or higher thoughts
may perhaps [2>] folde their §owne§$ particular mynds: w* heretofore I
doubt hath doon little good to the Colonie. Besides I hold fit that no
mutation be made, till S' Thomas Dales return: that we may first knowe
what coorse he §then entends to§ wi take. 8" George Yeardley hath
written of late twice to the Counseil, once by the Diana, & as w% came to
my hands; & since by the Prosperous, w™ are delivered to S' Thomas Smith.
The former packett I opened, having present oportunitie to write back
unto him: & now have sent it to o" Deputie M’ Ferrar, to be presented
to y* L? w'* the rest of the Counseil, when y* L? shall be pleased that they

LXXXII. Jonn Pory. A Letter to “tHe RigHT HONBLE AND MY
SINGULAR GOOD LORDE”

SEPTEMBER 30, 1619

Barlow Collection, 2270
Document in the New York Public Library. Autograph Lettor, Signed
List of Records No. 133

Right hon®!? and my singular good lorde, Hauing mett w® so fitt a mes-
senger as this man of warre of Flushing, I could not but imparte wt yor
lo? (to whom I am so ecuerlastingly bounde) these poore fruites of our
labours here; wherein though your lo? will espie many errours & imper-
fections, and matters of lowe esteeme; yet w'tall you wilbe contente to
obserue the very principle and rudiments of our Infant-Comonwealth;
w% though nowe contemptible, your lo? may liue to see a flourishing
Estate; maugre both Spaniards & Indians. The oecasion of this ships
coming hither was an aceidental consortship in the West Indies w‘ the
Tresurer an English man of warre also, licensed by a Cofiission from the
Duke of Sauoye to take Spaniards as Jawfull prize. This ship the Treas-
urer wente out of England in Aprill was tweluemoneth, about a moneth,
I thinke, before any peace was concluded between the king of Spaine & that
prince. Hither shee came to Captaine Argall then govern’ of this Colony,
being parte-owner of her. Hee more for loue of gaine the root of all euill,
[x x x] then for any true love he bore to this Plantation, victualled
& manned her anewe, and sente her w' the same Comission to raunge
the Indies. The euente whereof (we may misdoubte) will proove some
220 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

attempte of the Spaniard upon us, either by waye of revenge, or by way
of prevention; least we might in time make this place sedem belli against
the West Indies. But our Govern" being a soldier truly bred in that
vniversity of warre the lowe Countries, purposeth at a place or two upon
the riuer fortifiable to prouide for them, animating in the meane while
this warlike people (then whom for their small number, no prince can be
serued w better) by his example to prepare their courages.

Both those of our nation and the Indians also haue this Torride soffier
bene visited w' great sicknes & mortality; w’ our good God (his name
be blessed for it) hath reeompensed w‘* a maruelous plenty, suche as
hath not bene seen since our first coming into the lande. For my selfe
I was partly at land & partly at sea vexed w*" a Calenture of some 4. or
5. moneths. But (praised be god) I am nowe as healthfull as euer I was
in my life. Here (as yo lo? cannot be ignorant) I am, for faulte of a
better, Secretary of Estate, the first that euer was chosen and appointed
by Coffiission from the Counsell and Company in England, vnder their
handes & coffion seale. By my fees I must maintaine my selfe; w** the
Gouern’ telles me, may this yeare amounte to a matter of 300" sterling;
wherof fifty I doe owe to himselfe, and I pray God the remainder may
amounte to a hundred more. As yet I haue gotten nothing, saue onely
Gf I may speak it wout boasting, a general reputation of integrity,
for hauing spoken freely to all matters, according to my conscience; and
as neare as I could discerne, done every man right.

As touching the quality of this country, three thinges there bee, w*>
in fewe yeares may bring this Colony to perfection; the English plough,
Vineyards, & Cattle. For the first, there be many grounds here cleared
by the Indians to our handes, w** being muche worne out, will beare no
more of their corne, w*" requireth an extrordinary deale of sappe & sub-
stance to nourish it: but of our graine of all sortes it will beare great
abundance. We have had this yeare a plentifull cropp of English wheat,
tho the last haruest 1618. was onely shed upon the stubble, and so selfe-
sowne, w'out any other manurance. In Iuly last so soon as we had
reaped this selfe-sowen wheate, we sett Indian corne upon the same
grounde, w is come up in great abundance; and so by this meanes we
are to enjoye two crops in one yeare from off one & the same fielde. The
SEPTEMBER 80, 1619 221

greattest labour we haue yet bestowed upon English wheate, hath bene,
upon newe broken up groundes, one ploughing onely & one harrowing,
far shorte of the Tilthe used in Christendome, w** when we shall haue
ability enough to performe we shall produce miracles out of this earthe.
Vines here are in suche abundance, as wheresoeuer a man treads, they
are ready to embrace his foote. I haue tasted here of a great black grape
as big as a Damascin, that hath a true Muscatell-taste; the vine wherof
now spending itselfe euen to the topps of high trees, if it were reduced
into a vineyard, and there domesticated, would yeild incomparable fruite.
The like or a better taste haue I founde in a lesser sorte of black grapes.
White grapes also of great excellency I haue hearde to be in the country;
but they are very rare, nor did I euer see or taste of them. For cattle,
they do mightily increase here, both kine, hogges, & goates, and are
much greater in stature, then the race of them first brought out of Eng-
land. No lesse are our horses and mares likely to multiply, w* proove
of a delicate shape, & of as good spirite & metall. All our riehes for the
present doe consiste in Tobacco, wherein one man by his owne labour
hath in one yeare, raised to himselfe to the value of 200" sterling; and
another by the meanes of sixe seruants hath cleared at one crop a thou-
sand pound english. These be true, yet indeed rare examples, yet possi-
ble to be done by others. Our principall wealth (I should haue said)
consisteth in seruants: but they are chardgeable to be furnished w'*
armes, apparell, & bedding, and for their transportation, and casuall
both at sea, & for their first yeare coMfionly at lande also: but if they
escape, they prooue very hardy, and sound able men.

Nowe that yo" lo may knowe, we are not the veriest beggers in the worlde,
our Cowe-keeper here of Iames citty on Sundayes goes acowterd all in
freshe flaming silkes and a wife of one that in England had professed the
black arte not of a scholler but of a collier of Croydon, weares her rough
beuer hatt w* a faire perle hattband, and a silken suite therto correspe-
Se§ndent. But to leaue the Populace, and to come higher, the Gouerno™
here, who at his first coming, besides a great deale of worth in his person,
brought onely his sworde w* him, was at his late being in London,
together w his lady, out of his meer gettings here, able to disburse very
near three thousand poundé to furnishe himselfe for his voiage. And once

w'in seuen yeares, I am persuaded (absit invidia verbo) that the Gouerno™
1282—23 16
222 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

place here may be as proffitable as the lord Depuities of Irland. All this
not w'standing, I may say of my selfe, that when I was the last yeare
wtt yo" lo? at Middleborough, si mens non laeua fuisset, I might haue
gone to the Hagh w you, and founde my selfe there nowe in far better
company, w*" indeed is the soule of this life, and might haue bene deeply
ingrafted into yo" lo” seruice, w** since I haue a thousand times affected
in vaine. And therfore seing I haue missed that singular happines,
I must for what remaines, depende upon Gods prouidence, who, my
hope is, wilbe so merciful towards me, as once more before I dye, to
vouchsafe me the sight of your countenance, wherein, I speak vnfainedly,
I shall enioye as muche happines as in any other thing I can imagine
in this worlde. At my first coming hither the solitary vncouthnes of
this place, compared w‘* those partes of Christendome or Turky where
I had bene; and likewise my being sequestred from all occurrents and
passages w° are so rife there, did not a little vexe me. And yet in these
fiue moneths of my continuance here, there haue come at one time or
another eleuen saile of ships into this riuer, but fraighted more w* igno-
rance, then wt any other marchandize. At length being hardned to this
custome of abstinence from curiosity, I am resolued wholly to minde
my busines here, and nexte after my penne, to haue some good book
alwayes in store, being in solitude the best and choicest company. Besides
among these Christall riuers, & odoriferous woods I doe escape muche
expense, envye, contempte, vanity, and vexation of minde. Yet Good my
lorde, haue a little compassion upon me, and be pleased to sende me,
what pampletts and relations of the Interim since I was w" you, as yo"
lo? shall thinke good, directing the same (if you please) in a boxe to M
Ralfe Yeardley Apothecary (brother to Sir George Yeardley our gouer-
nour) dwelling at the signe of the Hartychoke in great Woodstreet, to be
sente to me by the first, together wt” his brothers thinges. This pacquett
I deliuered to one Marmaduke Rayner, an Englishman, who goes inter-
tained as Pilott in this Flemishe man of warre. If he come to yo? lo®, as
he hathe promised, he wilbe the fittest messenger. All possible happines
I wishe to yo" lo’, and to my most honoured lady; and though remote in
place, yet neare in affection, doe reste

Att the same Consultation Nouembr 11" the gouernor demanded the
opinion of the Counsell concerninge a piect revealed vnto him by Neue-
mettanan an Indian Comonly Called by the name of Englishe Jacke wt"

of male and female Children: of Corne and other thing¢ and to devide the
Conqvered land into two eqvall parte betweene vs and them:

This piect those of the Councell embraced because they found the warre
to be lawfull and well grounded the ayd reqvired to be verye small and
not of Consequence enough for Opachancano to put any trecherous dis-
aster vpon, this y? onely way to obliege Opachancano who ever since St

Jealousy and would not be drawne to any treaty at all notwthstanding

could doe more or w' lesse I professe it is want of iudgm' in me if I haue

not only appeale to those gentle? pnt (who only bring matt" of fact must

If any thing ean this be not able to cleare a pr this I know not what is.

Studieng w" my self what service I might doe yo", as a token of my
gratefull rememberance for yo" many favo™ and constant love shewed
me, aswell in my absence as when I was ji'sent wt yo" I could not at
this tyme devise a better, then to giue yo” notice of some pticulers
both of of Pisent estate, and what happened since the departure of the
Diana. And though I am well assured, yo” wilbe satisfied herein more
fully by of Governo', yet I desire yo" kind acceptance of this my poore
indeavo'.

Presently after the Diana hadd her dispatch St George Yeardley (according
to a Coffiyssion directed vnto him and to the Couneell of State,) caused
Burgesses to be chosen in all place who mett at James City, where all
matters therein conteyned were debated by severall Cofiyttees and
approved: and lykewise such other lawes enacted, as were held expedient
& requisite for the wellfare and peaceable goverm! of this Coifion-weale.
Captaine Martines Burgesses for his Plantaéon were not admytted to
this Assembly, the reasons I am assured yo” shall receive from o* Governo’,
who sendeth home a report of all those pceeding€.
242 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

These principall men being at James Citie, Cap** William Epps (who
commandeth Smythes Hundred Company) was arraigned (as neere as
might be) according to the lawdable Lawes of England, for killing one
Captaine Edward Roecroft als Stallenge. He came hether from the North
Colony in a shipp of S' flerdinando Gorges (as he sayd) for some necessaries
w he wanted; and to coast along the shoare to fynd and discover what
Harbo™ and riu9s he could: but through neglect of the M* of the shipp
and others she was forced a ground in a storme neere Newports Newes,
and there sprang so greate a leake, that he could not carry her back
againe. This myschance happened through vneivill and vnmanly word¢
yrged by Stallenge (there being no ficedent malice) wt w Captaine
Epps being much moved did strike him on the heade w a sword Sin the$
skabberd @ such an vnfortunate blowe, that w'tin 2. daies he died. The
Jury (whereof Capt Lawne was foreman a discreete and vnderstanding
man) hearing the Evidence, found him guilty of Manslaughter by Chaunce
meddley. The Governo™ fynding him (though young) yet a pper civill
gent, and of good hopes, not long after restored him to his Command.

Captaine Henry Spelman being aceused by Robte Poole (one of the inter-
preto™ of the Indian language) of many crimes w might be pliudiciall to
the State in generall, and to every mans safety in pticular, receiued
Censure at this generall Assembly. But the Governo™ hoping he might
redeeme his fault being §pceeding§ much of Childishe ignorance, pdoned
the piinishmt [1] vpon hope of amendm*. In triall whereof he was yin-
ploied as interpreto™ to Patawamack to trade for Corne.

Captaine Ward in his shipp went to Monahigon in the No: Colony in
May, and returned the latter end of July, w‘ fishe w™ he caught there.
He [He] brought but a smale quantitie, by reason he hadd but little salte.
There were some Plymouth shipps where he harbored, who made greate
store of fishe, w% is farr larger then New-land-fishe.

The George was sent by the Cape Marchant (w'* the Governo™ consent)
to New-found-land to trade and buy fishe for the better releif of the
Colony and to make triall of that passage. One other reason (as I take it)
was, for that the Magazin was well stoored w* goode, it was some what
doubtfull, wheth? a shipp would be sent to carry home the cropp so sone
as the George might vpon her returne back. She departed hence about
the 9 of July, and arriued here againe about the 10: of Septemb"™. She
JANUARY, 1619/20 243

made her passage to Newfound-land in less then 3. weekes, and was at
the banck amongst the french fishermen in 14. daics. She came back +
hether againe in 3. week¢, wt bare wynd¢, and brought so much fishe as
will make a saving voyadge, w™, besid€ the greate releif, giveth much
content to the wholl Colony.

The Sturgeon shipp and the Triall departed hence togeth? about the fiue
of July. M*™ Pountys hath taken greate paines in fishing, and toward
Michellmas (the weather being somewhat temperate) made some good
sturgeon. He hopeth by the spring to be better fitted, w® Cellars and
houses, and to do some good therein.

The Cattle in the Triall came exceeding well, and gaue the Colony much
ioy and greate incouragem'. Both they horses and Mares wilbe very
vendible here a long tyme, the Colony increasing w people as of late.

About the latter end of August, a Dutch man of Warr of the burden of a
160 tues arriued at Point-Comfort, the Comando'™ name Capt Jope, his
Pilott for the West Indies one Mt Marmaduke an Englishman. They mett
wt the Trér in the West Indyes, and determyned to bold consort shipp
hetherward, but in their passage lost one the other. He brought not any
thing but 20. and odd Negroes, w the Governo’ and Cape Marchant
bought for vietualle (whereof he was in greate need as he yitended) at the
best and easyest rat¢ they could. He hadd a lardge and ample Cofiiyssion
from his Excellency to range and to take purchase in the West Indyes.

Three or 4. daies after the Trér arriued. At his arriuall he sent word
p’sently to the Gou2no" to know his pleasure, who wrote to him, and did
request inyself Leiften*nte Peace and M* Ewens to goe downe to him, to
desyre [23] him to come vp to James Cytie. But before we gott downe
he hadd sett saile and was gone out of the Bay. The occasion hereof hap-
pened by the vnfrendly dealing of the Inhitant¢ of Keqnoughton, for he
was in greate want of victuall¢, wherew™ they would not releive him nor
his Company vpon any termes. Ile reported (whilst he staied at Keq-
noughton) that if wee gott not some Ord’nance planted at Point Comfort,
the Colony would be quyte vndone and that ere long: for that vndoubtedly

About the begynnyng of Septemb' J-apazous (the King of Patawamack@
brother) cames to James Cyty to the Governo’. Amongst other frivoulous
messagé he requested, that 2. shipps might be speedyly to Patawamack
where they should trade for greate stoore of corne. Herevpon (according
+ to his desyre) the Governo' sent an Englishman wt him by land, and in
the begynning of October, Capt Warde shipp and Somer-Iseland¢ frigate
departed James Cyty hether-ward.
Robte Poole being wholly ymployed by the Governo' of messag® to the

dance in o' ground¢ (for a more plentyfull yere then this, it hath not pleased
God to send vs since the beginning of this PlantaCon, yet very contagious
for syeknes, whereof many [2] both old and new men died) the Governo™
sent two men vnto him, who were returned w* frivoulous aunsweres,
sayng he never hadd any intent to come vnto him. The Gou9no™ being
iealous of them (the rath? because wee hadd many straggling Plantatons,
much weakened by the greate mortality, Poole lykewise proving very
dishonest) requested Captaine William Powell and myself (for Opachan-
kano pfesseth much love to me, and giueth much credite to my worde) to
goe in a shallopp unto Pomonkey ryver: weh wee did. Going vp that

wth Opaihankano, before or asone as any newes came to him eyther of

heathen) but after their message was delyuered, it was kindly taken, they
sent away lovingly, and Poole accused and Condemned by them, as an
instrum' that sought all the meanes he could to breake o" league. They +
seemed also to be very weary of him. ®& Opachankano much wondered

I would not goe to him, but (as I wished the messengers) they said I was
syck of an ague, wherew they was were satisfied. Wee hadd no order
to bring Poole away, nor to make any shew of discontent to him, for feare
he should pswade them to some myscheif in 0” corne feild¢, hoping to gett
him away by fayre meanes. So wee returned in greate love and amyty to

being very peaceable wth all the oth? Indyans, at their departure they T

List of Records No. 156
Most worthy knight,
After my sicknesses and miseries past, the Bona noua hath brought
me in particular one singular and cordial comfort namely the newes
of your being elected Treasurer: for nowe I am confident, that what
250 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

seruice soeuer I shall indeuour for the publique shall come to that hand
wt knowes howe to value it, and will not onely accepte, but esteem it.
The defect is (w® makes me sigh) that my sufficiencies from hence (heu
quantum est in rebus inane!) cannot in the thousand parte answere
yours euery way so complete, out of England. And though I had it in
my person, yet the place so newly inhabited wantes many helpes,
wherwt® those ciuiler partes doe abounde. Howbeit this yeare to come
(for the last was full of infirmities in all kindes) so it please God to con-
tinue my health as it is, being neuer more perfect in any place wheresoeuer
1 haue remained, I will rouze up my spirits to doe all that may be possible.
Neither shall the vneertainty of my being continued, or by some newe
gouernour thrust out of my place, any whitt dismay me from performance
of my duty for the Interim; for that is a stroke, though many times vnjust
and cruell, for w there is no sense. In this dispatche I haue sente you
enclosed in a letter of mine to the Counsell and Company, a copie of a
warrant from the Gouern’™: and Counsell here, for establishing my fees,
according as it was there ordered in courte, before my coming awaye.
Herein (as all of them can be my witnesses) I was not mine owne caruer
at all; but they in [1] mine absence, and w“out my suggestion, did order
mine allowance, as appeareth in the same copie. For the first whole yeare
from the time my comission was deliuered me, I receiued not a farthing,
and since that, very little, being faine to trust the most of those I doe
seruice for. If the Company shalbe pleased to confirme vnto me that,
w* all men of reason here do thinke to be but reasonable, I shall esteem
both my hazard and my paines well bestowed, although, do what I ean, I
feare me, that at my three yeares ende I shall skarce make a sauing voiage.
In suma sumard, whatsoeuer they in their wisdom and bounty shall
thinke fitte to allotte me I will rest contented.

Now in answere to your letter by the same ship. Your loue I do most
thankfully acknowledge; and I thinke Sir George Yeardley will not deny,
but he hath still cause to affect me euery day more and more. To that
noble Earle I am deeply bound, who cannot but testifie on my behalfe,
that when he employed me in his owne particular seruice I performed it
fully to his minde, and aboue his expectation, and will hope to do the like,
if ever I shall haue the honour to serue him againe. As it hath bene your
indeuour to maintaine his lo” good fauour toward¢ Sir George Yeardley,
FANUARY 18, 1619/20 251

so (as you will perceiue by somewhat that comes in this dispatche) it hath +
bene my care to nourish Sir George his duc respect. and worthy seruice
towards his lo”, and this also out of regard to the good of [24] Virginia.
It would grieue me, that any erro’ or disaster should haue any power to
worke any contrary effecte. But you knowe that humanii est errare, and
disasters what wisedome ean preuent? If his lo” be offended in ought, it
wilbe in respect of his more then ordinary affection towards Captain
Argall, whose faultes Sir George was bounde by comission, and for the
saluing of his owne reputation also, to discouer. Sir George Yeardley, I
thinke, would not robb Captaine Argall of my lordes loue, for he hath in
him to deserue muche; nor would he haue his lo? to haue spent so muche
loue upon any man in vaine; but onely doth wishe that Captain Argall
being riche, a Bachelour, and deuoid of chardge, would not so excessively *
intende his owne thrifte. As touching Sir George his intereepting of my
letters, his lo? I knowe (so noble is he) will not be implacable. And on
the other side, I knowe not howe he will interpret that w® hath bene
written concerning the Treasurer (w™ Argall called his ship, while she was
here) or concerning Spelmans vnaduised using of his lo”* name to Opo-
chancano. Meane while in the dangers wherein the Colony stood, Sir
George thought himselfe vnworthy of a remedy, vnlessc he had sett dewne
the truth of the case. What tempestes that answere of his by the Diana,
and those other letters then and since haue raised in your court, I doe
almost fear to think of. Without his comandement I did nothing [2]
and that w** I did, he viewed and reuiewed still to a syllable. All w®
upon the sending away of this dispatch we throughly perused, and he
constantly auowes and Justifies euery iota and title. Jacta est alea, and
some body must run the hazard of it. But if we be blamed for doing part
of our duty, then what should we haue bene, if we had done all? All that
I can say is, that whatsoever errours of mine be represented back hither
(for in the distemper I was ia, I could not ehuse, but coihitte some) I shall
be more willing to amende, then euer I was to comitte, and shall honour
them most, that read me my lesson most roundly. And whosoeuer do so,
shall in my conceipte do far better, then those others (who they were, 1
knowe not) that by the Marigolde putt this gouernour for the tine
(whenas I serued him w'' the greatest fidelity and zeale that was possible)
into so many violent needles Jelousies against me, which notw standing

*
252 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

had not the force to batter downe my patience of prooff. That lawe of
iustice and friendship so to doe right to one friend, as to beware of offring
wrong to another, I haue as duely obserued, as I could any way deuise.
And you shall well perceiue, howe I haue concurred with you to close up
the breache, w** was in danger to haue growen wyder. So haue I ever
since my coming hither performed the parte of a true friend, and that for
the publique good, wherin I pray god, we may all haue Joye. For per-
forming my requestes, w'*owt answering my letters, I most humbly [34]
thanke you. This far in answere of your kinde letter. I haue sente you
in Sir George his boxe of letters directed both to your selfe, and to his
brother, the copies of our two dispatches both by the Prosperous and the
Flemish man of warre, to the ende, that if you haue occasion, you may
make use of them, I haue sent you also inclosed w*" this, the copie of
my letter to you by the Fleming; and a copie also of my letter I write
nowe to my lord of Warwick, to the end you should from my part, be
ignorant of nothing wherby you may doe any good office between that
most noble lord and Sir George Yeardley, and for none other purpose.
This seeret I would not putt into §any§$ hand but yours, nor into yours,
but onely for that intent. I am to confident of your true worth, as I dare

inferiour. By the Bona noua I purpose to sende you copies of suche
graunts of lande, as we shall haue passed to the ende, that if you like not
the forme, you may be pleased to reforme it. If you receiued Sir George
his dispatehe by the Prosperous I would beseech you to viewe the general
petition $against Captaine Argall§ of those nine of James citty, §contained
in one sheet§ and to compare the original w“ the copie sent you nowe in
Sir George his boxe, and if you finde neuer so little difference between
them §though but a worde§ that you would vouchsafe to giue me notice
by the first, for it may concerne me. You may best doe it by correcting
the said copie by the original, and sending it back againe. More time I
will not presume to rob you of, that haue so many better wayes to employe
it. [8%] Mine humble duty and seruice I beseech you to present to your
noble and vertuous lady. And so wishing her ld°, your selfe, and your
generous ofspring all happines, I reste
Yours euer most humbly bounden to loue and serue you.

Postseript

Wheras in my letter by the Fleming I wrote concerning Poole the Inter-
preter, that Sir George would make him sure for telling any more false
tales to Opochaneano, if onee he gott him into his power; at Pooles coming
lately home we were quite of another opinion. For bringing the Kinges
picture as a messenger from Opochancanough, we counted him a pub-
lique, and as it were a neutral person, and so for not discontenting Opoe-
chancanough, w'* whom nowe we stand in termes of reconciliation, we
thought if no wayes convenient to call Poole to accounte.

One fauour yet I must humbly beseech of you, and that is, after this dis-
patche hath bene perused in the courte, you would be pleased to sende it
my lo: Carewe to read it ouer, and likewise if there be any thing w* his
lo® hath not seen in the last dispatche by the fleming.

At the sealing up of this I cannot finde the copie of my letter to you by
the Fleming, w*', it may be, you shall finde in one of the other pacquette.

Untill the last moment of sending away, I had forgotten to write you a
list of their names both Colony men & ether passengers that came in the
Bona nova, wherby it appeareth, there want three Colony men of the
number of an hundred. Nor doth it appear whether the passages of all
the rest that in the same note go vnder the name of Passengers be payd
for, or freely given by the Company. Captain Welden saith, the Com-
pany gave him passage for twoe, Thomas Smyth and Edward Kerby gen-
tlemen, w*' the Gouern’ will not accept of as a warrant sufficient to saue
him harmeles, w“out certificat from the Company. W two, together
w'» Adames that goes vnder the name of Mr Whitakers man, the Gouern’
will not lett passe for England; nor yet Mr Hansbies man in pledge of
George Eden that by your order is to go for Smyths hundred, till such
time as he receive other order from the Company, or vntill there come
three others in their roome

Once more give me leave to interrupt yo"§ in § answeringe an obiection
w™ some may make against 8" George Yeardley for pferinge to serve y°
Cépany in his place of his governem', for his three yeares in Case he be
continued gratis.

Against this some man may alleadge that he hath broke his proffer in
takinge this yeare a rente of Corne and tobacco, though not much, from
Martins hundred people, whom Capt Argall had placed on the G[overno]*
lande.

To this he answeres, first that what he received from them did not arise
out of y* labours of those fifty of his guarde, w** y* Company allowed him,
by whose labo" he hath not yet reaped a penny benefit, save onely and
meerely in Corne, w* he Cannot Converte into mony, because he muste
reserve yt for his next yeares provision. Secondly he is at least 800"
sterlinge out of purse by reason of this Chardgeable employmt and that
yf he should heale vp his estate againe out of y° Governo"™ lande, onely to
that suifie, and no farther, yet might he be sayd to serve them, gratis,
havinge made but owne of owne. But still he pfesseth as in his former that
he Conseerateth that expence wholly to y® service of y° Colony, that he
will not from henceforth rayse a penny proflit out of those mens labo™ that
remaine of his guarde. or that shalbe sent over for a farther addition, but
apply it wholly to y® buildinge and mayntaininge a fort at Point Comforte:
and lastly that he tooke that petty rente of Martins Hundred people, to
make them acknowledge by y® same act of theirs that Paspaheigho by? +
expresse wordes in y® greate Comission did belonge to y°? Governo™ and
that they had bene wrongfully seated by Capt Argall vpon that lande,
w both he had instructions, and 8* George Yeardley Comission to lay
out for y® Governo™ vse.

S' George adviseth not onely y* Adventurers for Smythes hundred, but
y? generall Company also, to send hither husbandmen truely bred (whereof
here is a greate scarcity, or none at all) both to manage y* Plough. and
breake o? oxen and horses to that busines. Besides he wisheth y* generall
Company would send greate store of Vignerons, and Vine plants of a good
race though growinge in England, albeit they woulde doe better to be had
of ffrance and Spaine. M*' Nicholas Leate y° Marchant hath vpon my

severall skills to y® plantinge and dressinge of a vineyard and to y* makinge
and preservinge of wines, whereof o" nation is ignorant, as needes must
wee have Vignerons frem from forraine partes: And vineyards beinge
once planted where such infinite store of caske may be provided, wee
might §for want of other coffiodities§ lade all y* ships that come, w‘" as
rich wines as ffrance or Spaine doth yeild. S* George brought hither some
plant¢ w° doe prosper passinge well, but his Vigneron being a fretfull olde
man is dead. And because Canary wine is y° most durable in all voyages
and Climates of anie, and so Consequently y° most salable and proffitable:
yt would doe passinge well, yf wee could get store of plant¢ from thence,

Right Honorable:
Being vnable to give my personall attendance ypon the Ll*, I have
presumed to addresse my Suite in theis few lines vnto yo" Honor. The
Citie of London have by Act of their Common Counsell, appointed one
Hundred Children out of their superfluous multitude to be transported to
Virginia; there to be bound apprentices for certaine yeares, and afterward
w'h verie beneficiall condiéons for the Children; and have granted more-
over a levie of five hundred pound among them selfs for the apparrelling
of those Children, and toward their charges of transportaéon. Now it
falleth out that among those Children, sundry being ill disposed, and fitter
for any remote place then for this Citie, declare their vnwillingnes to goe
to Virginia: of whom the Citie is especially desirous to be disburdened;
and in Virginia vnder severe Masters they may be brought to goodnes.
But this Citie wanting authoritie to deliver, and the Virginia Company to
transport theis persons against their wills: the burden is layd vpon me, by
humble suite vnto the Ll to procure higher authoritie for the warranting
thereof. May it please yo" Honor therefore, to vouchsafe vnto vs of the
Company here, and to the whole Plantation in Virginia that noble favou’,
as to be a meanes vnto their L** out of their accustomed goodnes, and by
their higher authority to discharge both the Citie and our Company of this
difficultie, as their L®* and you" Honors in yo" wisedomes shall find most

pray. And so I take humble leave: and rest

CV. Copy oF OPINION OF COUNSEL UPON THE PATENTS OF THE
VIRGINIA CoMPANY

May, 1620

Manchester Papers, No. 271
Document in Public Record Office, London
List of Records No. 170

Vpon Consideraéon of the patent¢ & of the questions move therevpon, I
am of oppinion as followeth.

1

That 8" Thomas Smithe is not so absolutely made Tier by the 2 patent as
that he is not removable by the lawes & orders of the company; either
vpon his owne Desire to surrender the place; or vpon other cause w® they
shall conceyve to be reasonable; ffor although yt may seeme a hard expo-
si¢on of the wordes (or other seu%all cecasions) that there wills shalbe
taken as an occasion to remove him; wttout expressing any lust cause in
certeyne yett when they haue removed him by a gen%all consent; it is not
now to be questioned (as I Conceyve) whether they had lawfull cause or
no; but there doing® are to be holden lawfull & iust: & §that by§ the
intenéon of the 2 patent w"out any helpe of the third; But when a Lawe
(by authority of the 3 patent is made) at a gen9all court by Consent of
the wholl Company that all officers shall cease at such a tyme & newe to
be chosen; that is byndinge, & makes this point wout question as I take yt

2

That by the clause of the 3 patent where the wordes are (we do give &
graunt to the sayd tier & Company & there successo™ foreu? by theis
pinté, that the sayd titer & Company or the greater nomber of them so
assembled (viz at the gen%all quarter Courte) shall & may haue full powe
& authority to choose Councillo™ & officers & to make lawes &e That in
this case the greater nomber of the Company w“out the tier may make
Lawes &e: & that as well when there is no tfer at all, as when he is absent;
ffor as I do conceyve this great & gen2all Quarter Court w"" is appointed
by the 3 patent onely may be held w*out any tier at all; and all thing¢
are to be dispatched there by the greater nomber of the company then
assembled, & that by the expresse wortes of the patent; ffor although the
268 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

graunt be to the sayd trer & Company for the doinge of theis thinges at
this Court, yett that is but for forme onely, because all graunt€ must be
made to them by there name of Corporaéon & yt is not requisite that the
t®er should be pinie or haue any voice in the makinge of theis Lawes; But
for the holdinge of the petty Court€ apointed by the patent, (& to be
suiiioned by the tier) the tier must be one by expresse wordes, but so it
is not here; Neither hath the trer any negatiue voice in the makinge of
theis Lawes, nor can hinder the doinge of any thinge w the greater
nomber of the Company at this gen%all Court will do; and therefore in
reason his {nce is not needfull, the rather seinge he is not appointed by
the patent to be plnte, as he is at the other Courte.

3

Iam of oppinion that the Company (wt*out the tfer) having power to
make Lawes at the gen2all Court, haue also power to repeall & abrogate
all or any former Lawes as yt seemes they haue done, for the Lawe of
repeall is a Lawe as well as the former & eodem modo quo Constituitur
Dissoluitur; And so the Lawes that were made for the degrees of estab-
lishing Lawes, & for elecéon of officers by the balladinge boxe, though
they were excellent & Comendable; yett being repealed by the same
authority they were made, they are gone & determined

4

S* Edwin Sandes cannott be Continued tfrer by the act of the company
vpon his former elec@on, for that is against the Lawe of the company that
all officers shall cease at the quarter courte Day in Easter terme yearely;
but the Company may then choose him anewe, as yt is likely they did

5

I thinke that the Company here hath no power by the wordes of the 2
patent either to punishe or pdon offences comitted in Virginia especially
in Capitall or criminall causes; 1 because they haue no power to pceed
here against any such offence, as the gou9no* there may do; & yf not to
peeed against it then not to pdon yt; 2 although that graunt of the patent,
be aswell to the t?er & Company & there successo™, as to the gou2no'; yett
the power is given to them accordinge to the natures & Limitt¢ of there
offices & places, respectiuely, that they shall & may w"*in the pleinct@ of
Virginia or in the way by the seas thither &¢: haue full power to Correct
MAY 1, 1620 269

punishe pdon gou9ne & Rule &&: Nowe when a gou9u0' is chosen & sent
thither he hath a kinde of Regall power to execute Lawes & to punishe
offenders there and also to pdon them yf he sce cause & that by the wordes
of the patent; w°" is more then the Company can do here; for any offence
Committed here, where the offence requires the punishm' of life or member;
muche lesse for any offence done there (as IT Conceyve) because they are
not to execute any Lawes there but by ther gou2no"; And besides so muche
may be gathered vpon the wordes of the 3 patent where the Company are
authorised to remaund & send backe offenders to virginia there to be
punished and pceeded against accordinge to the Lawes there established
for offences there comitted, and the reason is apparant because that by
those lawes nor by any other they Cannott be pceeded against here for
offences done there, nor pdoned here when they are pceeded against there;
And so I thinke that for all matters wherein the gou9no’ may peeed there
by lawes there established, & for matters pp to his Gou?nein', the Company
here haue no power to Controll his act@: And the clause of the 3 patent.
whereby the Company are authorised either to punishe misbehauio™
or Contempté or to send the offendo™ to virginia to be punished is to
taken seu%ally & distributiue reddendo singula singulis; that is for offences
that are comitted against the company here (& against w* they may
peeed) they may punishe the offenders here; But for offences done in
Virginia against the peculiar Lawes there established for that gou?nem’,
they must send the offendo™ thither to be punished or not at all; and being
peeeded against there by those Lawes, they are not to be pdoned here;
And this I take to be the playne meaninge of both the patent¢ touching
this point.

who have been here these 3 dayes, & since by Captain Wilkins, who came
this morning, that y" were very well. We expected this morning, that the
Bonaventure would have been come about: now they expect hir this
evening. And till then I am told that I may not stirr from hence, by
reason of som writings w* must have my hand unto them, ffor as for
my owne letters, they are readie to an haire: having spent in a manner
all my tyme here, in writing letters & Directions, to & for Virginia. ffor
I have left neither person, nor thing unanswered: nor omitted anie thing
to the best of my understanding, w* might serve for advancement of the
busines. So carefull have I been to be no example of negligence: w I
knowe o* people there would be too prone to imitate. This I knowe y*
will hold for a iust cause, & no exeuse, of my abode here longer then I
before had purposed. But would to God there were no other cause then
that. Then should I be free from as much sorroe, care, & feare, as I ever
endured for anie one thing in my life.

ffor my wife by reason of a fever, w°* seazed on hir last thursday, hath
had such an inflammation on the one side of hir neck, that it Shath§
excoriated hir throte on the inside, w* is most dangerous for hir life.
And although I humbly thank God, we hope it beginneth §now§ to hele:
yet dooth it deprive hir (beeing w' chyld) of all strengthning nourish-
ment, & thereby is as dangerous to hir & hirs another way. Twice she
hath been let blood, & one tyme purged: w* §also§ encreaseth hir weaknes.

All w® notwithstanding, such & so strong is hir affection, that she will by
no meanes $be§ persuaded to stay behynd me: so that on Thursday God
permitting we set out, entending to take leysure, & make it three days
woork. I have enlarged to y" these particulars, that ys may thoroughly
free me from blame. Besides in verification of the Italian Proverb, Il
mal non viene mai scompagnato; my Coachman going one eevening to
Sandwich, & falling into the hands of thiefs, was so grievously beaten &
wounded that hetherto we have very small hope of his life: though he be
dayly looked to by a good physitian & surgeon: w% enforceth me to be
bold w* som of my neighbo™ to borroe one. Howsoever, if I be alive,
looke for me on Saturday. Mean tyme, I pray y* keep Wendsday Coort:
though for no other busines, yet to revive the three Committees set on
foot before Easter.
MAY 7, 1620 271
The first, for examination of the Acts of the Generall Assembly in Virginia.

The second, for the prizes unpaid, & monie unbrought in of the Great

The third, for all the Debts yet due by the Companie.

On the same day I pray y* also not to faile, to begin yo" Accounts of this

By the Treasuror, Councell and Company for Virginia.

THE Treasuror, Councell and Company for Virginia, to the Gouernour
of Virginia, and the Councell of Estate there residing, Greeting. We haue
to our great griefe receiued aduertisement of the mortality, which this last
yeere hath there wrought vpon the People, to the consumption of diuers
hundreds, and almost the vtter destruction of some particular Plantations.
And although we cannot herein but with much humility acknowledge the
iust finger of Almighty God, by this seuerity of chastisement, to recall vs
and you from those grieuous transgressions, which draw downe, euen from
clemency itselfe, such necessary punishments; and accordingly aduise you,
together with our selues, to humble vs in due contrition, before his mereifull
hand; and by future amendment, in better attending the Diuine worship,
and more carefully obseruing his holy and iust Lawes, to worke a recon-
ciliation, and to entreate the renewing of his most gracious fauour towards
vs. Yet obseruing on the other side, that this mortality hath proceeded
from a disease in it selfe not mortall, and accordingly hath most wrought
vpon the new Planiations, who (contrary to our hopes and intended pro-
uisions) were destitute of those meanes, which should haue relieued and
cherished them in their weakenesse and sicknesse, of which the ancienter
Inhabitants being prouided, did recover: We therfore, according vnto our
place and Christian duty, taking into our carefull considerations the
redresse and preuention of these defects in all future times: That both the
Colony may better attend the seruiee of God, and that the people now sent,
and which hereafter shall come, may be the better prouided against that,
and the like sicknesses, (seing in the health of the People, consisteth the
very life, strength, encrease, and prosperity of the whole general! Colony)
doe with mature deliberation and vnanime consent, ordaine and establish
as hereafter followeth.
276 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

First, we ordaine and require, that in conuenient time, after the sight
and publication hereof, the foure ancient generall Burroughs, called ames
City, Henrico, Charles City, and Kicowtan, (which hereafter shall be called
Elizabeth City, by the name of his Maiesties most vertuous and renowned
Daughter,) as also the other seuerall particular Plantations, shall each of
them, at their common charge, labour, and industry, frame, build, and
perfect, with all things thereto belonging, a common house, to bee called
a Guest house, for the lodging and entertaining of fifty persons in each,
vpon their first arriuall. Of which houses, to be raised in due and whole-
some places, each shall be sixteene foot broad within, and nine score foot
long, (vnlesse it seeme good to diuide that length into two houses:) And
in each of them shall be set vp all along on the one side, fiue and twenty
Bedsteads of foure foot broad, sixe foot long, and two foot height from the
ground in equall distance, and with partitions of Boords betweene them:
And there shall be raised in each of th® in conuenient places, fiue
Chimnies. These houses we also require to be strongly built for continu-
ance, with windowes well placed for wholesomnes of aire. And although
it were reason that each Burrough should beare the charge of such an house
entirely, being for the health and safety of their people: Yet for their
better encouragement, we haue, and by these presents doe grant and giue
to each Burrough, in consideration and aide of that worke, two Kine or
Heifers, to be deliuered at our charges, for the beginning of a stocke of
cattell, for their common or Burrough Land, by vs formerly granted.

And to the end that the People, both present and to come, may be
faithfully brought vp in the true knowledge and seruice of Almighty God,
and so learne to frame their liues and conuersations, as not onely, not to
prouoke the Diuine indignation, which pursueth the faithlesse and diso-
bedient soules by sundry kinds of punishment to everlasting destruction:
but also by their good example, to allure the Heathen people to submit
themselues to the Scepter of Gods most righteous and blessed Kingdome,
and so finally to ioyne with them in the true Christian profession: We doe
hereby ordaine and require, that in euery Burrough there be prouided and
placed at the least one godly and learned Minister, to be chosen in each
particular Plantation by the seuerall Aduenturers and Planters; And for
the foure ancient Burroughs, to be prouided and nominated by vs, and our
Successors; As also for the Tenants and Inhabitants of the Companies
ALAY 17, 1620 277

Land wheresoeuer: Leauing alwaies to the Gouernour to prouide a Minister
for his Tenants, and to the Colledge for theirs. All which Ministers and
their Successors, we earnestly pray and require to apply themsclues with
all diligence, to the training vp of their charge in the way of righteousnesse,
as the same is now professed, and by Law established in this Church of
England, and other his Maiesties Dominions, auoiding all factions, and
needlesse Nouelties, tending onely to the disturbance of peace and vnity.
And whereas we haue ordained heretofore, that one hundred acres of
Glebe land be set out and allotted for euery Minister, besides other profits
out of the Inhabitants encrease: We doe hereby also orduine, that the said
Ministers be furnished, each with sixe Tenants, towards the occupying of
his Glebe land: whieh sixe, for the Ministers belonging to the publike
lands; that is to say, the Gouernours, Colledges, and Companies Land,
shall bee sent and furnished wholly at the conmmon charges of the Company.
And for the Burroughs, as well the ancient, as those of particular Planta-
tions, the Company is content to furnish out at their charges, three Tenants
for each, vpon condition that the seuerall Burroughs furnish out three
more: which sixe, for each Minister being once so furnished, the Ministers
themselues shall be afterwards charged each to maintaine that number at
the least, and so to leaue them to his Successor.

And for as much as it is apparant to all vnderstanding minds, that the
wealth, happinesse and stability of each particular Estate, is founded
vpon the strength and prosperity of the publike, (the publike hauing been
of late yeeres wholly decayed and ruined, to the inestimable losse and
detriment of the whole Plantation, we haue carefully endeuoured to restore
and set vp in greater height than cucr, as by the supplies of sixe hundred
persons for publike vse, now, and lately sent, will manifestly appeare:) We
therfore vpon assured trust and confidence, that not onely your xclues,
the Gouernour and Couneell, but the whole body of the Colonie, and euery
member therof, taking into due consideration, how much the life and
health of the publike Tenants may import them all, as well for their ease
of publike burthens, as for support of publike Iustice, good order & gouern-
ment, will by all meanes apply themsclues to the entertaining and prouiding
for them so vpon their first arriuall, as that not onely their liues and healths
bee not indangered as heretofore; but that also they may cheerfully set
in hand, with the workes and labours directed and prepared for them; doe
278 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

earnestly pray and require both you, and them all, that all other businesse
of lesse importance laid aside, they immediatly affoord all possible assist-
ance, for the raising of houses and conuenient lodgings for them, with
other necessary reliefe and succour: Wherein whatsoeuer they shall doe
louingly and freely of their owne voluntary accord, we shall with due
thankes accept it at their hands, (desiring that particular notice be giuen
to vs thereof) and for that which is to be done by them, aboue that pro-
portion, there shall be recompence made of as many dayes workes by those
publike Tenants, at the next possible opportunity; thinking it equall neither
to refuse any helpe for the publike, nor yet to charge the priuate aboue their
contents and abilities. And although we haue absolute power deriued
from his Maiesty, to establish and enioyne by order the performance
hereof: yet seeing this aide is to bee yeelded but this once, (the publike
Tenants being henceforward to prepare for all new supplies) we haue
thought better by request, to try the loue of the Colony, than their
obedienee by command.

Lastly, for as much as it is become very apparant (which we haue often
heretofore foreseene and forewarned) that the applying so altogether the
planting of Tobacco, and the neglect of other more solid commodities,
haue not only redounded to the great disgrace of the Countrey, and detri-
ment of the Colony; but doth also in point of profit, greatly deceiue them
which haue trusted to it: We therefore endeuouring to reforme this errour,
and to restore due reputation to that Land and people, haue with great
care and charge (assisted also with some particular Plantations) endeuoured
to set vp sundry reall Commodities, and other some we haue thought fit
to recommend to your care to prosecute. Furst, Iron, being of most
necessary vse for the Colony. For the making whereof, we now furnish
out 150. persons, to set vp three Zron-workes, with all Materials and other
prouisions therunto belonging. Secondly, for CorpaGce; we much com-
mend the order taken by your selues, for the planting of Silk-grasse there
naturally growing, which we desire may be in the greatest abundance
possible, as conceiuing it to be of chiefe importance both for vse and profit.
Thardly, for Prrcn and Tarre, we aduise and require, that the Polackers be
returned in part to these their works, with such other assistance as shall
be necessary. The like we shall desire for Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, when
there shall be fit store of hands to assist them: Requiring in the meane
MAY 17, 1620 279

time, that eare be generally taken, that Seruants and Apprentices be so
trained vp in these works, as that the skill doe not perish together with the
Masters. The Fourth commodity recommended, is Timpsr of all sorts,
with Masts, Plancks, and Boords, for prouisions of shipping, and sundry
other Materials of much vse and benefit. And to the ease and encrease
of diuers of those works, prouision is now sent, for the erecting of Sawing-
Milles, which may fill the whole Colony also with Plancks and Boords, to
their great ease and helpe in setting vp their Buildings. The fifth, is SILKE,
for which that Countrey is exceeding proper, hauing innumerable store of
Mulbery trees of the best. For the setting vp of which commodity, his
Maiesty hath been graciously pleased, now the second time (the former
hauing miscarried) to bestow vpon the Company plenty of Silk-worme-feed
of his owne store, being the best to be had; which together with such other,
as from other places we could procure, we haue sent to you by the DVTY,
at a seasonable time of the yere; requiring the same to be dispersed amongst
the Colony, with order for the vsing therof, and especially to keep the
Wormes from the aire of Tobacco, which is mortall to them. he sixth is
Vines, whereof the Countrey yeeldeth naturally great store, and of diuers
sorts, which by culture will bee brought to excellent perfection. For the
effecting whereof, diuers skilfull Vignerons heretofore, and some now are
sent, with store also from hence of Vine-plants of the best sort. And
here by the way we aduise and desire, that Men of those Sciences, which
are not naturall to vs, be extraordinarily cherished and encouraged in their
workes: seeing if they should faile, it would be difficult to supply them.
The last commodity, but not of least importance for health, is Saur: the
workes whereof hauing been lately suffered to decay; we now intending to
restore in so great plenty, as not onely to serue the Colony for the present,
but as is hoped, in short. time, the great fishings on those Coasts (a matter
of inestimable aduancement. to the Colony) doe vpon mature deliberation
ordaine as followeth: First, that you the Gouernour and Councell, doc
chuse out of the Tenants for the Company, 20. fit persons to be imployed
in Salt workes, which are to be renewed in Smiths Iland, where they were
before; as also in taking of Fish there, for vse of the Colony, as in former
time was also done. These 20. shall be furnished out at the first, at the
charges of the Company, with all implements and instruments necessary
for those workes. They shall haue also assigned to each of them, for
280 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

their oceupation or vse, 50. acres of Land, within the same Iland, to be
the Land of the Company. The one moyty of Salt, Fish, and profits of
the Land, shall be for the Tenants, and the other for vs the Company, to
be deliuered into our Store: and this contract shall be to continue for fiue
yeeres. Wee doe also hereby grant and ordaine, that if any of the old
Burroughs, or other particular Plantations, shall be pleased to coneurre
in the same workes of making Sali, and taking Fish, they shall be admitted
thereunto to the number of twenty persons or vnder, for euery Burrough
or Plantation, with the like Grants as before, & with the same Diuisions of
profit, betweene them and their Landlords, as is before set downe betweene
the Company and their Tenants. These being the commodities (for
Corne and Cattell we passe ouer, being onely for sustenance of the people)
which we desire to haue set vp with all care and diligence, as well for
necessary vse and profit, as for the honour and reputation of the Countrey
and Colony; and for the aduancing of which, we haue spared neither care
nor cost, which on our parts was requisite to our best vnderstandings: It
remaineth, that we earnestly pray and desire you, that you also on your
parts correspond with vs in the like. And if any thing (as in so manifold
businesse) shall happen on our behalfe, to haue been omitted or vnprouided,
that you endeuour to supply it with all sueh helpe as may there be had:
For vnworthy he were to be a member of that body, that would not lend
his hand to the setting vp of workes so necessary and profitable, and whereof
himselfe may in short time be a partaker. And whatsoeuer in that kind
shall bee done through our desire, we assure you, shall be acknowledged
and recompenced by vs to their iust content. Gzaen in a great and generall
Court held for Virginia, the 17. day of May, 1620. and in the yeere of the
Raigne of our Soueraigne Lord Lames, by the grace of God, King of England,
Seotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, &e. viz. of England,

Most Noble Lord

Having not had the good fortune to attain to y* L?* presence after
som-tyme attendance, & beeing now forced to retire for a few days into
the Contrie; I have presumed once again in these few rude lines to
prezent my most humble suit & service to y* L’.
JUNE 7, 1620 295

I understand, by the late boastings of S8' Thomas Smith «& his partizans;
of their sedulous endevo's, by a cloud of untrueths to make a fresh inter-
position between the most ioyfull light of his Ma"? favo", & the darknes
wherewith my self & my service rest yet obscured.

An attempt of strange malignitie: w* if I have deserved by anie offer of
the least wrong to him or his, I will beare it w'* patience; as the effect of
iust Revenge, though not mesured by Justice. But if (beeing resolved by
Gods Grace to wrong no man) I have not so much as offended St Thomas
Smith or his upholders, save only in one kynd, in that I have not yielded
to the abetting or cloking of those coorses in menaging the affairs of
Virginia, w w'> derogation of his Mat authoritie, & contrary to his
Royall Instructions (unworthily smothered), have been held from tyme
to tyme, to the dishartning of all Adventuro's, & perpetuall keeping down
of the Plantation that it might not prosper; & on the other side to the
enriching of themsclfs or som of them, by meanes so unlawfull as the
enhazerding of the destruction & utter extirpation of the Colonie: And in
that it hath pleased God also so to blesse my late labo's, that more hath
been doon in my one yeare, w lesse then Eight Thousand pounds, for the
advancement of that Colonie in People & store of Commodities, then was
doon in S* Thomas Smiths Twelve yeares, wt expence of neer Hightie
Thousand pounds; as by vieu of bothe ot Accounts (if yet his be an Account,)
dooth manifestly appeare: Then my good Lord, I humbly tender to his
Ma** Princelie Justice, & to y°? L°* favorable mediation this equitable
suit, that his Ma‘* upon this complaint against me may be graciously
pleased, to call me to my answer, before anie indifferent Judges to be
deputed by his Mat. And if 8t Thomas Smith or his abettors be able to
make good anie one of their materiall accusations against me; or if his
Matic should please also so to appoint, (though it be farr from my dispo-
sition to be an Accuser of anie man,) that I be required to make good
what I have here enformed to y* L’, & I faile in anie one materiall clause
thereof: I shall willingly submit my self to condign censures for bothe, &
from thencefoorth make utter forfeit of all hope of his Ma“* favo", beeing
that w of all worldlie things I most earnestly desire. It was the saying
of a wise man, that One good man dooth never hate another. Seeing
therfore this extreme hatred of me by S' Thomas Smith, dooth argue a
great defect of Goodnes in the one: let tryall I beseech discover the partie
296 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

that is in falt. The procuring of w* iust tryall, I shall ever acknowelege
as a singular & eminent favo" from y* noble L?: beeing the onlie meanes
remaining of dooing me right w* his Ma**. Touching the former busines
about the Place w** I held this last yeare for Virginia; as I wrate to y™
L? before, so now also I repeate again: If by y* Le® mediation, on wt I
wholy relie, my self & my service may be so accepted by his Ma**, as that
w't comfort & courage I may proceed in this busines, I shall willingly,
though to my great charge, & neglect of my owne estate, (for this Busines
is too great to admit anie concurrent w* it,) bestowe one yeare more in
foloing this service, if w his Mat‘ approbation I be called unto it: And
will also presume to offer a Proiect to his Mat, (w** though in som points
it may seem difficult, yet is unassured in none) of raising to his Mat
there a great & speedie revenue, w“out charge to his Ma's cofers, save
som small matter to grace the Action. But if his Ma‘: pleasure shalbe
otherwise, & so as to suspend me from this service: upon the least inti-
mation thereof from y*" L?, I shall of my owne accord so withdraw my
self from the Action, as no way to be occasion of hindering the choise of
anie other, whom his Ma‘ shalbe pleased to appoint or commend: beeing
wholy resolved for no worldlie respect whatsoever, either actively or
passively, so much as lyeth in my power, to be anie matter henceforward
of the least offence to his Ma**, trusting also that by this my willing
obedience & duetie, his Matis gracious hart may be one day moved, to
restore unto me the light & comfort of his Princelie favo", we? w** all loyal
humilitie I shall evermore seek & sue for. Amongst the manie great
grace wherewith God hath furnished y L?, this vertue of protecting the
throwne down from farther iniurie, & of expatriating the long exiled in
his Ma‘ favo, I hope shall not proove least in way of his Ma‘ service,
nor the meanest in meriting hono" to y** noble L?: upon whose Happines
the faithful service shall ever zealously attend, of
‘Ye L?* most humbly in all duetie at command,

Sir, having in breife as the tyme and buisines would give, leave, in
our publike letter to your selfe and the Counsell, given some answer to
the letters we have receaved, yett my selfe in pticular being so much
bound to you, as all your many favors have oblieged me, could not but
take some tyme by the opertunity of this ship the London marchant to
make §my§ excuse vnto you in that I have not written at large in answer
of all your letters w by these 4 ships I have receved, the w duty yf
God pmitt me lyfe and health I will not fayle to ppforme to the vttmost
I can by the next conveyance. There lying at this psent +sen vpon my
shoulders so great a burthen that I am not able to looke into all pticulars
so sodaynly as this Ship will depart, this great nomber of people also
ariving ex Enexpected it hath not a littell pusseled me to pvide for the
ledging of them, it being a thing of spetiall consequence and nessesity
for theire healths, but herein I must acknowledge your care and zeale for
the hasty and speedy erecting this good worke, in the sending so many
people for sondry pfitable employments in Each where of I doe here
passe my pmise vnto you, and hould my selfe bound to doe my best
endever, and had not your zealous desires over hasted you and the passage
at sea bin Soe unfortunate to the duty, whereby I had no warning at all
given to pvide for these people, I should have bine able to have done
much better then now I can, yett I beseech God to give a blessing to my
endevors, they are now all loged within good houses as this Country doth
afforde not one but lyeth vpon a bed stead high frd the ground and
have theire victualls well dressed and it is allso both amended and
enlarged [1] to theire full content, theire pvision w came with them
out of England being nothing but meale is very harsh for them to feed
vpon being new comers, therefore I have for varyety sake and in regard

defense of y* same Citty, and so of themselves; yet they repyned as much

Of these Iron workes so much affected by y? Company, neyther y’ Gov-
erno", nor wee of y° Counsell have any skill at all and must therefor be
slowe in delyvering o° opinions. Onely wee thinke, that so heavy and so
ymportant a worke, beinge fytt to exercyse y° most perfect, Comon weale,
should have taken moe tyme of delibtation there in England. But espe-
cially some skillfull man should have pvsed y° country for a whole yeare
before, and should have bene sure of some abundant Iron mine and fyt
places to worke yt in, Notw“standinge that heretofore there hath in many
partes of this Country bene gathered some quantety of that mine from
y® supfieyes of y° earth.

ffor Pytch and tarre, true yt is, that as some quantety hath heretofore
bene made, so may there be some made hereafter, but some here that have

By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia

After the many disasters, wherewith it pleased Almighty God to suffer
the great Enemy of ail good Actions and his Instruments, to encounter
and interrupt, to oppresse and keepe weake, this noble Action for the
planting of Virginia, with Christian Religion, and English people: It
hauing pleased him now contrarily of his especiall great grace, so to
blesse and prosper our late earefull endeuours, as well for the repairing of
all former breaches, as for supplying of the present defects, wherewith the
Colony was kept downe, that it hath as it were on a sodaine growne to
double that height, strength, plenty, and prosperity, which it had in
former times attained: We haue thought it now the peculiar duety of our
place, accordingly as it hath beene also ordered by a generall Court, to
Summon as it were by a kinde of louing inuitement, the whole Body of
the Noble and other worthy Aduenturors, as well to the conseruing and
perfecting of this happy worke, as to the reaping of the fruit of their great
expences and trauailes.

308 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

And first to remoue that vnworthy aspersion, where[2]with ill disposed
mindes, guiding their Actions by corrupt ends, haue both by Letters from
thence, and by rumours here at home, sought vniustly to staine and blem-
ish that Countrey, as being barren and vnprofitable; Wee haue thought it
necessary for the full satisfaction of all, to make it publikely known,
that by diligent examination we haue assuredly found, those Letters
and Rumours to haue been false and malicious; procured by practise, and
suborned to euill purposes: and contrarily disaduowed by the testimony
vpon Oath of the chiefe Inhabitants of all the Colony; by whom we are
ascertained, that the Countrey is rich, spacious and well watered; tem-
perate as for the Climate; very healthfull after men are a little accustomed
to it; abounding with all Gods naturall blessings: The Land replenished
with the goodliest Woods in the world, and those full of Deere, and other
Beasts for sustenance: The Seas and Riuers (whereof many are exceeding
faire and nauigable,) full of excellent Fish, and of all sorts desireable; both
Water and Land yeelding Fowle in very great store and variety: In
Summe, a Countrey, too good for ill people; and wee hope reserued by
the prouidence of God, for such as shall apply themselues faithfully to his
seruice, and be a strength and honour to our King and Nation. But
touching those Commodities for which that Countrey is proper, and which
haue beene lately set vp for the Aduenturors benefit: we referre you to a
true note of them, lately deliuered in a great and generall Court, and here-
unto annexed for your better information. By which and other approued
informations brought vnto vs, We rest in great assurance, that this
Countrey, as it is seated neere the midst of the world, betweene the
extreamities of heate and cold; So it also par[3]ticipateth of the benefits of
bothe, and is capable (being assisted with skill and industry) of the richest
commodities of most parts of the Earth. The rich Furres, Cauiary, and
Cordage, which we draw from Russia with so great difficulty, are to be
had in Virginia, and the parts adioyning, with ease and plenty. The
Masts, Planckes, and Boords, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and
Sope-ashes, the Hempe and Flaxe, (being the materials of Linnen,) which
now we fetch from Norway, Denmarke, Poland, and Germany, are there to
be had in abundance and great perfection. The Iren, which hath so
wasted our English Woods, that it selfe in short time must decay together
with them, is to be had in Virginia, (where wasting of Woods is a benefit)
JUNE 22, 1620 309

for all good conditions answerable to the best in the world. The Wines,
Fruite, and Salt of France and Spaine; The Silkes of Persia and Italie, will
be found also in Virginia, and in no kinde of worth inferiour. We omit
here a multitude of other naturall Commodities, dispersed vp and downe
the diuers parts of the world: of Woods, Rootes, and Berries, for excellent
Dyes: of Plants and other Drugges, for Physicall scruice: of sweet
Woods, Oyles, and Gummes, for pleasure and other vse: of Cotten-wooll,
and Suger Canes: all which may there also be had in abundance, with an
infinity of other more: And will conclude with these three, Corne, Cattle
and Fish, which are the substance of the foode of man. The Graines of
our Countrey doe prosper there very well: Of Wheate they haue great
plenty: But their Maze, being the naturall Grae of that Countrey, doth
farre exceede in pleasantnesse, strength, and fertility. The Cattle which
we haue transported thither, (being now growne neere to fiue hundred)
become much bigger of Body, then the [4] breed from which they came:
The Horses also more beautifull, and fuller of courage. And such is the
extraordinary fertility of that Soyle, that the Does of their Deere yeelde
two Fawnes ata birth, and sometimes three. The Fishings at Cape Codd,
being within those Limits, will in plenty of Fish be equall to those of
New-found-Land, and in goodnesse and greatnesse much superiour. To
conclude, it is a Countrey, which nothing but ignorance can thinke ill of,
and which no man but of a corrupt minde and ill purpose can defame.

Now touching the present estate of our Colony in that Country, We
haue thought it not vnfit thus much briefly to declare. There haue bin
sent thither this last yeere, and are now presently in going, twelue hundred
persons and vpward, as particularly appeareth in the note aboue specified:
and there are neere one thousand more remaining of those that were gone
before. The men lately sent, haue bin most of them choise men, borne
and bred vp to labour and industry. Out of Deuonshire, about an hundred
men, brought vp to Husbandry. Out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire,
about one hundred and ten; and out of Sussex, about forty; all framed to
Tron-workes: the rest dispersedly out of diuers Shires of the Realme.
There haue beene also sundry persons of good quality, much commended
for sufficiency, industry and honesty, prouided and sent to take charge
and gouernment of those people. The care likewise that hath beene taken
by directions, Instructions, Charters, and Commissions to reduce the
310 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

people and affaires in Virginia into a regular course, hath bin such and
so great, that the Colony beginneth now to haue the face and fashion of an
orderly State, and such as is likely to grow and prosper. The people are all
diuided [5] into seuerall Burroughs; each man hauing the shares of Land
due to him set out, to hold and enioy to him and his Heires. The publike
Lands for the Company here, for the Gouernour there, for the College, and
for each particular Burrough, for the Ministers also, and for diuers other
necessary Officers, are likewise laid out by order, and bounded. The
particular Plantations for diuers priuate Societies, are setled in their
Seates, being allotted to their content, and each in conuenient distance.
The rigour of Martiall Law, wherewith before they were gouerned, is
reduced within the limits prescribed by his Maiestie: and the laudable
forme of Tustice and gouernment vsed in this Realme, established, and
followed as neere as may be. The Gouernour is so restrained to a Counseil
ioyned with him, that hee can doe wrong to no man, who may not haue
speedy remedy. Each Burrough, and each particular Plantation, partly
hath, partly is bound to haue in short time a sufficient Minister: for whom
maintenance is ordained, to each of two hundred pounds a yeere value.
Which orderly proceeding there, by direction from hence, hath caused
the Colony now at length to settle themselues in a firme resolution to
perpetuate the Plantation. They fall to building of Houses, each for his
owne priuate; and the Generalitie to the rearing of publique Guest-houses,
for entertaining of new men vpon their first arriuall. They fall to set vp
their Ploughes; to the planting of Vineyards; to the pursuing of the Staple
Commodities furnished and commended from henee. In summe, they are
now so full of alacritie and cheerefulnesse, that in a late generall Assembly,
they haue in the name of the Colony presented their greatest possible thankes
to the Company, for the care that hath beene taken for the set[6]ling of
the Plantation. Neither is it to be omitted, the care which hath beene
had here lately at home, for the reducing of all the proceedings and affaires
of the Company, to an orderly course of good gouernment and Iustice.
Wherein to begin with the fountaine thereof, his Maiesties authoritie and
pleasure, there hath beene a collection made of all the branches of the
same, dispersed in his Letiers Patents, now three times renewed: as also
out of other Instructions proceeding from his Maiestie. Out of both
which, together with such other Orders as (authorized by his Maiestie)
JUNE 22, 1620 sil

the Company themselues haue thought necessary to make, hath beene com-
piled a booke of standing Orders and Constitutions, approued by the generall
consent of all the Company: whereby both the company here, and the
Colony in Virginia, haue their businesse carried regularly, industriously,
and lustly, euery man knowing both his right and duty, to their generall
great content, and the great aduancement of the Action. And whereas
the Colony likewise haue beene often Sutors in effect, to reduce into a
compendious and orderly forme in writing, the Lawes of Kngland proper
for the vse of that Plantation, with addition of such other, as the nature
of the place, the nouitie of the Colony, and other important circumstances
should necessarily require: a course is likewise taken for the effecting of
this worke; yet so as to submit it first to his Majesties view and approbation ;
it being not fit that his Maiesties Subiects should be gouerned by any
other Lawes, then such as receiue the influence of their life from him.

And now to come to that which concerneth the Aduenturors in particular,
by whose charges, care, and labour (next vnto his Maiesties especiall
grace) this famous Plan|[7]tation hath not onely beene vndertaken, but
through so many difficulties vpheld and continued: we should be very
greatly iniurious to them, if we should not acquaint them with this season-
able time, for the reaping of that benefit and reward which is due vnto
them. We therefore let them know, that in this last yeare now ended,
there haue beene granted by the Company vnder their legall Seale, eleuen
seuerall Patents for particular Plantations; and more are in hand to be
passed this next Quarter-Court. It is not vnprobable that vpon each of
these Patents, diuers hundreds of persons will soone Plant in Virginia:
there haue beene already transported vpon the first, aboue three hundred
men. These and other like Planters, hauing priority of time, will haue
priority also in choise of the Seat of their Plantations. Seeing therefore
the onely matter of retribution to the Aduenturors, is by a faire proportion
of Land to them and their heires; namely of one hundred acres for euery
share of twelue pounds & ten shillings, vpon a first diuision; & as much more
vpon a second, the first being peopled; with fiftie acres for euery person,
(to be doubled in like manner) which at their own charges they shall
transport to inhabit in Virginia before the 24. day of Tune 1625. if he
continue there three yeeres, either at one or scuerall times, or die after
he is shipped for that voyage: It standeth them vpon, who are not willing
312 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

to be the least in the benefit to be partaked, not to be the last in setting
foorth to the choise and peopling of their Land. Wherein what fauour or
assistance may by vs be giuen them, they shall be well assured of it, in
equall proportion with our selues, as their charges and long expectance
haue well deserued. And to the end that not onely the Aduenturors now
liuing, but the Heires also of the de[8]eeased, may take certaine notice of
the seuerall proportions of Land, which ratably to their Aduentures in mony
are due and belonging to them: And likewise that posteritie may truely
know, by whose charges this Plantation (next vnder his Maiestie) hath
beene happily founded, maintained, and continued: We haue here, ac-
cording to an Order of Court, set downe in an Alphabeticall Table the
names of all the Aduenturors, with all their seuerall summes aduentured.
Wherein if by errour, or other mis-accident, there haue wrong be done
to any man; if within one twelue moneth after the date hereof, he giue
notice and make proofe thereof to the Companies Auditors, he shall be
set right, and the Table reformed: there being not any thing more deere
vnto vs, then to doe right vnto them, with all Iustifiable curtesie, who haue
beene beginners and continuers of this glorious worke, tending so much
to the propagating of the true seruice of Almighty God, to the adding of
greatnesse and honour to our King, and to the benefit of our whole Nation
in disburdening their multitude. 22. Lunij. 1620.+

there, diuided in foyle onely, but {till participating in the religious and
happy gouernment of this their natiue Countrey, may continue alwayes
as one and the fame people with vs, according to the moft Princely direc-
tion of his Maieftie: We haue thought it very neceffaric for the feconding
and forwarding of thofe fo noble Defignes, not onely to publith them to

the fame, but alfo to fet downe fuch particularities requifite, as whereby
the preparations of all forts needfull, may vpon this timely warning, both
better and more feafonably be made and compaifed.

Firft therefore we haue thought fit, to make it publikely knowne, that
befides the great ftore of particular Plantations now in prouiding, and like
very fhortly in large proportion to augment, the Company haue refolued
in a late generall Court, by the bleffing of God, to fet out this yeere at

of the qualities enfuing: Firft, foure hundred, to be Tenants of the general
land of the Company, to make vp the number of thofe Tenants ful 500.
wherof 200. to be placed at Hlizabeth Citie, with the Companies Deputie:
100. at Henrico, 100. at Charles Citie: And at fames Citie there are a
hundred and more already. Secondly, one hundred, to be Tenants to fueh
Officers, &e. as the Court already hath, or fhall thortly appoint: vz. 10.
for the Deputy of the College, [17] 40. for the Companies Deputy: 20. for
the Secretary: 10 more (befides 50. already fent) for the Minifters: and
20. for the Phifitian: their care for the eafe and profperity of the Colonie,
being fuch and fo great, as to caufe them to endowe thofe Offices and
places, (as they haue formerly done others,) with faire pofleffions, furnifhed
with Tenants and other fit prouifions: that the people may haue the
benefit. by them, and yet be freed from the burden. Thirdly one hundred
yong Maides to make wiues for thefe Tenants as the former 90. which

likewife to the publike Tenants. Fiftly, one hundred feruants to be

offered to defray their charges with very great thankes. And although
by reafon of the preparations already made, the difficulty may be well
conceiued to be in great part ouercome, and the profit much more neere,
and more eafie to come by, yet the Companie wholly affecting the peoples
profperity, haue determined to deale both as fauourably in the Contracts,
314 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

and as bountifully in all forts of furniture and prouifions with the Tenants
which fhal now goe, as they haue done with thofe, which haue beene
formerly fent. Which conditions it hath beene thought fit here to reinfert
and publith.

kre man tranfported into Virginia, with intent there to inhabit, as Tenants

to the Commen land of the Company, or to the publike land, /ball be freely
landed there at the charge of the Company: And foal be furnifbed with pro-
uifions of victuall for one whole [18] yeare next after his arriuall, as alfo of
Cattle: And with apparell, weapons, tooles and implements, both of houfe and
labour, for his neceffary vfe. He fball enioy the ratable moytie of all the
profits that fall be raifed of the land on which he /ball be Planted, as well
Corne and Cattle, as other commodities whatfoeuer: the other halfe being due
to the Owners of the Land.

He fall be tyed by Couenant, to continue vpon that Land for the Terme of
feauen yeares: which being expired, it/bal be in his choyfe, whither to continue
there or to remoue to any other place, at his owne will and pleafure.

Of thefe perfons, one hundred and twenty (fuch as are to be Tenants) are
to be flipped here for Virginia, by the midft of Auguf? now at hand: and
the reft in January and February enfuing.

The next preparations are of Cattle of diuers forts: whereof there are
intended in the next Spring to be fent thefe enfuing. One hundred Kine,
for this addition of 500. Tenants. One hundred Kine more, to remaine
in a perpetuall ftock vpon the Companies Land, to be lent to new Planters,
as hath bin formerly ordered. Foure hundred Goats, twenty Mares,
fourefeore Affes to be procured from France: The care of prouiding which,
is commended to diuers felect perfons by parts, and the whole to the
ouerfight of the generall Comitties.

The laft prouifions appointed to be made, are for the fetting vp, or increafing
of diuers principall Commodities. For Szike, there is prouifion to be made,
of great ftore of Silke-worme-feede about Michaelmas [19] next: as alfo of
men skilfull in the ordering as well of the Wormes, as of their Sake, which
are to be fent away in a Pinnace, in O@ober betimes. For Hempe and
Flaxe, Pot-afbes and Sope-afbes, Pitch and Tarre, there is a Treaty already
on foote, for procuring of men skilfull in thofe Trades from the Hafterne
JUNE 22, 1620 315

parts: befides the Polekers yet remaining in Virginia. Vor Wines, it is
alfo ordered, that men skilfull be procured in the planting and drefling
of Vines, out of France and from the Rhene: and from thence alfo and
other parts to procure Plants of the beft kindes. For Oyle, befides great
quantitie to be made out of the Walnuts, growing naturally in Virginia
in great abundance, Olcue-Planis are to be prouided from Marfeilles and
Ligorno. Yor Fie, which on thofe Coafts are taken in great plenty, and
in worth much better then in New-found-Land, there is care and a courfe
taken, to preferue the Companies Liberties, and to fet vp the VFifhings in
better fort then heretofore. For Salt, order is giuen for the making of it
in abundance, and after the manner of thofe hotter Climates, which may
prooue a great helpe to increafe the Plantation. For Iron, there is sufficient
done alreadie.

And for Sawtng-Milles, befides thofe already gone this Spring, there are
lately come from Hamborough, diuers Workemen very skilfull, to be fent
in the next fhip. And that nothing may be wanting for the Companies
Tenants, there is a Pinnace already, and other Boates {hall be prouided,
to remaine there at the Deputies commaund, to trafiique and trade for the
Company and their Tenants vnder his charge.

[20] Thefe large fupplies of men, Cattle, and Commodities, as they tend
to the accomplifhing of this great worke of the Plantation: fo can they
not be themfelues effected, without large prouifion of money, being the
finewes and mouing Inftruments in thefe great Actions.

To which end wee defire the noble and worthy Aduenturors, to be aflifting
to vs, by fuch meanes as they fhall pleafe: efpecially that the remaine of
all promifed Aduentures, may in Michaelmas Terme next be paid in
without faile, which we truft will now be done cheerefully on all parts,
the inuitements of this yeere being well confidered: that as the prefenting
of their firft payments, hath been the beginning, fo the performance of
the later, may be the perfecting and finifhing of this worke, fo glorious
before God and man.

And here by the way, for the clearing of fome feruples and errors through
miftaking of our writings lately publifhed, we are to aduertife, that the
Alphabet of Aduenturers and fummes aduentured, neither then conucniently
316 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

could, nor was intended to extend any further, then to fuch fummes as
haue been paid in to the Treafurors of the Company, and to Sir Bapti/t
Hicks, by {peciall order of Court. And whereas diuers other bils of Aduen-
ture, haue bin heretofore deliuered, partly vpon perfonall aduenture, and
no money paid in, partly vpon gift from the Company, in regard of deferts,
partly for fummes paid to other men, whofe Accounts hang yet vncleared
(and not to the Treafurors) and partly for goods which neuer came [21]
within the Treafurers Accounts, but of other inferiour Officers, into whofe
hands they were deliuered, for which notwithftanding bils of Aduenture
haue been deliuered, mentioning as if it were money paid to the Treafuror:
Ii the Aduenturors fhall be pleafed within the time prefixed, to put in
their iuft claimes, by thefe or any other wayes whatfoeuer, there fhall be
right done to them, and a new Alphabeticall booke fhall be publifhed,
embracing exactly all kinde of Aduenturors, with their feueral fummes
either really aduentured, or otherwife accepted, allowed or beftowed, be
it vpon what caufe, or in what kinde foeuer.

Now if the Aduenturors be thus requefted, with much greater reafon are
all Accountants to the Company to be prayed and required, to prepare and
make perfect their feuerall Accounts, and to pay in thofe monyes, which
fhall remaine due to the Company: that fo all parts concurring with their
duties and endeuours, the worke may proceede with generall ioy.

Laftly, as heretofore, fo we now alfo declare, that the perfons to be admitted
to goe, as the Companies-Tenants, and with the forefaid conditions, fhall
be no other then good men, that is to fay, of good Trades, of skill in
husbandry, or induftrious labourers; and fuch of thofe as fhall be commended
for their honeft conuerfation: which perfons repairing to the Citie of
London, to Mr. Ferrar, Deputy to the Company, his houfe in St. Sithes
lane, in the beginning of Augu/?, and in the middle of fanuary, next,
according to the feuerall numbers at thofe times to be fent, fhall from
thence-forward be entertained, at the Companies char- [22] ges, til fueh
time as they be fhipped for Virginia: there being efpeciall care likewife
taken, for the prouiding of good Commanders and Directors of their
workes.

Giuen in a Generall Court held for Virginia the eighteenth of Iuly, 1620.

Courts.

i

There are foure great generall Courts, commonly ealled Quarter-Courts,

IIl.

Every Wednesday fortnight, reckoning from the great Courts, shall also
be held an ordinary Court for this Companie, for dispatch of ordinary and

vnlesse there be fiue of the Counseil there (the Treasuror or Deputy being
one) and fifteene of the Generality.

TV.

It shall be in the power of the Treasuror, or the Deputie in his absence,
vpon extraordinary cause to call an extraordinary Court.
1620 341
V.

It shall not be in the power of any other then a Quarter-Court, to make
any contract whereby to binde the Company for any continuance of yeares.
In which case it shall be proposed also in the Preparatiue Court next
preceding.

VI.
[57]
Pvblique businesse shall haue the precedence in the Courts before priuate,
vnlesse there be extraordinary important cause to the contrary.

VII.

If any thing ordered in an ordinary or lesser Court, be afterward reuersed
in one of the great and generall Courts: [It shall be from thence-forward as
though it had neuer beene so ordered.

VIII.

All Courts shall begin at two of the clocke in the afternoone, and dissolue
at the rising of the Treasuror, or of the Deputie in his absence.

1

Nothing shall be put to the question after sixe of the Clocke in the after-
noone,

xX,

In regard of the great businesse for Virginia yearely encreasing, It shall
be in the power of the Treasuror, (if hee see it so necessary) to assemble
the Quarter-Courts both in the fore-noones and after-noones of the dayes
appointed for them.
AL

The Companie shall be summoned to the Quarter-Courts, and Courts
extraordinary, by the Off[58)cer: But of the ordinary Courts themsclues
shall take notice. And the Secretary shall keepe a booke of the proceedings
of the Courts: who with the Booke-keeper, Husband, and Bedle, shall at alt
Courts giue diligent attendance.
342 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

XII.

It shall be lawfull at a general Court, and with consent thereof, to dispence
with all meetings in long Vacations, or in such part of them as may be
spared; vnlesse some extraordinary matter befall, in which case may be
called extraordinary Courts.
SUITE,

The Treasuror and Compante, being a Body and Commonaltie perpetuall,
shall haue one faire and common Seale, to be kept by the Treasuror; and
not to be affixed to any Grants or Instruments whatsoeuer, otherwhere
then in publike Courts, or by warrant from thence.

XIV.

The Treasuror and the Counseil, or the Court, haue power to admit any
into this Society.
Elections.
XV.

At the great and generall Court, commonly called the Quarter-Court, in
Easter Terme, all Offices [59] of this Companie (excepting the Counseil)
shall be voyde: And the Court shall proceede to an election of new Officers,
in manner following.

XVI.

The Treasuror in the beginning of the Court, at the giuing vp of his Office,
shall declare by word or writing the present estate of the Colony and
Planters in Virginia. And deliuer into the Court a Booke of his accounts
for the yeare past, examined and approoued vnder the Auditors hands:
Declaring withall the present estate of the Cash.

XVII.
After the choyse of a Treasuror, a Deputie shall be chosen; then the Auditors
and Comattes; and lastly the Secretarte, Booke-keeper, Husband, and Bedle.
XVHI.

At the choise of each Officer, the persons nominated for the election, shall
withdraw themselues till the party chosen be publiquely so pronounced.
And generally no man shall be present in the Court, whilest himselfe or his
matter passeth the iudgement of the Court.
1620 343
RIX.

In regard of the weighty and manifold businesse of this Companie, which
is also like daily to encrease: [60] No man shall be chosen Treasuror of the
Companie of Virginia, who at the time of his election is Gouernour of any
other Company; but vpon condition that before the next Quarter Court
hee effectually resigne that other Goucrnement: except it sceme good for the
behalfe of both Companies, that the same man be also Gouernour of the
Somer Ilands Company.
XX.

It is for weighty reasons thought very expedient, that no man continue
in the place of Treasuror or Deputie, aboue three yeeres at once.

XXI.

For the auoiding of diuers inconueniences, It is thought fit, that all elections
of principall Officers in or for Virginia, as also of the Treasuror and Deputie
here, be performed by a Ballating box, as in some other Companies,

XXII.

Every Officer as he is chosen, shall openly in Court take his oath: or if he
be absent, at the next Court he commeth to.

XXIII.

The Treasuror, Deputie, Auditors, and Comitties, hauing no certaine allow-
ance for their cares and labours: the reward of these former Officers accord-
ing to their deserts, is referred to the pleasure of the Court wherein new

Officers are chosen.
[61] Treasuror.

XXIV.

The Treasurors duety is to keepe the ordinary Courts of Virginia: and vpon
cause extraordinary, to call Courts extraordinarily. And in all Courts,
and other meetings, hee is to haue a casting voyce.

XXV.
He is to moderate the Courts in qualitie of a President: And to cause
grauitie, decency, and good order to be obserued: And for breach thereof,
344 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

after a graue admonition first giuen, and not preuailing; to proceede to
reformation by the iudgement of the Court.

XXVI.

He is to propound and put all things to the question which the Court
requires, vnder paine of being immediatly put from his Office, if he refuse.
In which case the Deputie shall doe it, vnder the like paine. And if he
refuse, then any of the Counseil there present.

XXVII.

Whereas the Treasuror is to put to the question all things which the
Court requires: It is [62] explained to be intended of such things as are not
contrary to his Maiesties Letters Patents or Instructions, nor to the standing
Lawes and Orders of the Company.

XXVITI.

He is to haue care that the extraordinary Comitties appointed by the Courts
to seuerall busines, doe prosecute the same; and giue seasonable account of
their doings to the Court.

XXIX.

He is also to haue an especiall care, that no Grant or Patent doe passe from
the Companie, but vpon examination thereof by a select Comittie, who are
exactly to obserue the Orders made concerning them. And to this end,
with diuers others, he is to haue a vigilant eye on the Companies and
Counsetls Seales, that they be not wronged by abusing of them.

XXX.

The Treasuror, vpon receipt of publique Letters from or concerning
Virginia, shall assemble at least foure of the Counseil to impart them to
them; and by their assents shall cause them to be read in Court, vnlesse
there be some cause of secresie: In which case he shall communicate them
with the Counseil onely. In like sort the publique Letters and Instructions
to be sent to the Gouernour, Counseil, or People in Virginia, or otherwise
concerning them, hee shall cause to be publiquely read and approued by
the Court, or Coun[63]sezl, as the case shall require. And neither he, nor
any other, shall of his owne head or authoritie, write or send any directions,
1620 345

swaruing from such as the Court or Conseil shall giue, vpon paine to be
dis-franchized.
XXXI.

The Treasuror shall assemble the Counsetl vpon all weightie oecasions
requiring serious deliberation: And shall haue care with them, that the
Lords of his Maiesties priuie Counsetl be acquainted with all matters of
extraordinary and greatest importance concerning the State.

XXXII.

July .1620.||

There is in Virginia and is like to be shortly .3000. people, And the greatest
want they complayne of is good drinke, wine beinge too deere, and barly
chargeable, w though it should there be sowen, it were hard in that
Country beinge soe hote, to make malt of it, or if they had malt to make

good beere.
1982335

366 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

Theis .3000. people I accompt beinge eb most labouringe men, and the
country very hote, will drink one w an other a wine pottle a day, w® for
.3000. people is .23. tunne and .28. od gallons accomptinge .4. hoggesheads to
the Tunne and each hoggeshead to contayne .64. gallons wyne measure.

There shalbe shewen a way to make an artificiall wyne of a vegetable w%
there growes plentifully w°" any manner of charge or labour in plantinge
w artificial drink shall not cost accomptinge all charges of gettinge the
said comodity and makinge it into drink above vj* a Tunne, w® is .xij? a
barrell accomptinge .6. of our beere barrells to a Tunne.

Each houshold if they please may brewe it themselves, wherin they cannot
miseary as vsually they doe in makinge of beere or ale.

This artifitiall wyne beinge as cleere as any well-fyned wyne w any
hipostesis, grounds or lees, shall be as harty, holsome pleasinge and com-
fortable for the body as any beere or wyne whatsoever.

This kind of drink shall not growe flat decay or sower, though it be kept
a wholl yeare, w* all sorts of beere and wyne are subiect to, especially in
such hot countries.

Though there be never soe much drunk of it at a tyme, it will make noe
man drunk.

It is an excellent p'servative against the sear scurvy and other diseases,
and infections w* are incident to people at the sea in longe voyages, there
being many in a shipp, As also very medicinable for all such as live in
lowe marshe grounds subiect to many vnholsome fogs and damps.

It may be caryed to sea in longe voyages insteed of water beere or wyne,
for neyther heat nor cold nor any alteraGon of the ayre or contry will
cause it to putrify decay or growe sower.

This artificiall drink is as good the first day it is made as ever after, wheras
beere or ale newe brued, or wine in the must, requyre tyme, as well before
their grounds or lees be sepated, as also before they come to pfection.
And then being come to pfeetion they keep not longe, but growe hard,
eager, sower and lastly turne to vineger.
JULY 5, 1620 367

It maketh noe body heart burnt at sea, as sharp, eager and sower wyne
or beere doth.

If there were in the collony ten tymes as many people, they may have
sufficient of this drinke at the foresaid rate.

The makinge of this artificiall wyne may here be showne either in a Tonne
or .10. tonne, or what one pleaseth: we have likewise of that comodytie
in England.

The propounder desireth vpon demonstraéon of it here to the company
that he may have but .1000" besides the benefit in Virginia of serving the
collony, wt the said artifitiall drinke at the said rate of vj* the Tunne.

Agreed' wt some litle varyaéon wt M' Russell: the Aemunist & chimist.

of very countenance in them w™ trample upon us, is to me a sure arguinent

Virginia all I trust stands well. ffor I have written of all things at large,

But for my owne private, things are not so well as I could wish, ffor my
wife hath been in danger: & hir midwife sent for. Yet now she goeth on:
Yet will not be able to travail before she be lighted. This will keep me
longer from y", & sore against my will. But what my mouth cannot
performe, my pen shall supplie.

T pray y" therfore desire M* Carter to forbeare the pre laying in of beer
till he heare from me again, unles it be such as will be good at Alholemtide.
The enclosed is from Captain Nuce to 8 J. Davers, to whom I pray y*
commend my entire affection. Pray Mt Carter to send me down 1000.

wholl gou9nem* of all our people and affayres ioyntly by one other Comis-
sion vpon yourselfe and M* Tracy accordinge to the tenor of the former to
captayne Woodleefe, makinge noe doubt of your prudent vsage therof,
pfitably also for yourselves and vs: wherin if difference in execuéon arise
betwene yee we have taken order for vmperinge therof, as by other
Covenant quadrip"® amongst vs may appeare, wherof one pte is sent
for you to seale and returne agayne to vs by this ship.

We pray you forget not to procure an effectuall tre or other declaraéon
from §' George Yardley that he wholly wayveth any entermedlinge in our
plantagon or affayres, vnder or by colour of that Indenture w* we here-
tofore passed in his name and our owne, w we suppose he will readily
doe, as vnwillinge to pay in redy mony in England .450" w*" his fifth
pte at least cometh to, with the wages for hire of this Ship and of the Mr
and maryners: His last tres give vs also a kynd of assurance therof.

ffor many respects we hold it expedient to vse expediton in passinge
our patent from the company here for th’ inheritance of our land or some
pte therof, wherfore we pray you to get the same measured bounded and
plotted (w Thomas Kemis vndertaketh out of his owne sufficiency
exectly to pforme) And to pcure from the governor such certificat as the
nature of that busines and the vsage of the country there doe requyre,
wherin we pray your best diligence [130] and myndfullnes and returne
therof by this ship: for which by our Ch™ pty we are to pay for six
monthes hire, though shee returne in shorter space.

Your care also must be to peure a certificat from the gou9nor and secre-
tary of the arryvall of the fifty psons (or more) w*" we nowe ship for
plantaéon, and are pticularly menéoned in the certifieat of the mayor of
Bristoll, wherof Mt Tracy hath a copy; we pray you to be carefull in the
receipt of such materialls, tooles and implements of husbandry and other
furnitures and provisions, aswell nowe sent in this ship as w°" were sent in
the former to our and your owne excessive charges, and to cause exact
Inventories therof to be made the better to requyre due accompts from such
as vnder you shall have the charge of them.

In pformance of the last years pmise made by you and ourselves to Tho:
Coopy your Carpenter, we nowe send over his wife and sonne and daughter
for whom he hath twice specially written, the same also beinge by her
much importuned at our hands; wherin in regard of our charges (loosing
also therby the transportaéon of .3. laboringe men) such Condiéons are
to be made w™ the husband as may retribute to vs a competent satisfacéon,
w* we refer to yourselfe and M* Tracy, be the same in augmentaéon of
the years of his, her and their sonne and daughters services, or in increase
of his rent for the land he is to receyve of vs at the end of his .3. years or
otherwise as in your wisdomes you shall thinke more fittinge.

We send you a copy of our agreem' w'* Richard Smyth and six others,
who are our first tenants or vndertakers to the halfes in that kynd: If
they fynd respect and pformance from you of what we have pmised (w®
is most just they should) vpon their tres (w* covertly or openly they will
send over to their frends and neighbors) dyu9s others (by their private
agreem') will be like affected and sutors to vs: And therfore howe you
like of those Condiéons or wherin you wish any variaén or addigon, we
desire (for our better instructon in the future) to have your advice by
this ship.

ffive of our servante have written to their frends, and some of them to
ourselves, by Ires dated in ffebruary and March last to have two servants
the peece sent over for their owne pryvate benefit and imploym* by this
Ship pmisinge apparell and dyet out of their meanes in your family and
that country, Wherin as none of their[131] request¢ are by vs or their frends
yet satisfyed (because the desire seemeth somewhat strange) yet we would
not have you to leave them without assurance of our favor and satisfacéon
of their reasonable request€ in our future returnes and supplyes, if you
and m? Tracy shall signify the same to be convenient, But to have satis-
fyed one and not all would have begot murmur or discontent in the neg-
lected psons: herein we pray you carry a tender hand, because they are
all of the better sort: phaps also your vnexpected (yet welcome) cominge
amongst them, may have buryed in them that humor or desire.

We must pray you to bend your vtmost care and diligence to subsist, as
much and assoone as is possible of yourselves: for theis great supplyes are
400 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

insupportable in longer contynuance, as more pticularly by this or the
next Ship that cometh from England, you will both in our generall and in
your pticular accompt vnderstand from me John Smyth.

Markhams and Goovges booke of all kynd of English husbandry and
huswifry, and .2. others for the orderinge of silk and silkwormes are nowe
sent, w"* take into your owne hands from Thomas Lemis, otherwise you
will bee defrauded of them.

We have sent you also a great quantity of the best seeds for a kitchen
garden, and of the most vsefull kynds, wee need not comend to you the
effectuall care of them, because a great pte of the food of your family must
aryse from them: With them cometh also a reasonable quantity of the
seeds of cotton wooll, wt Thomas Combes your ptener hath peured in
London.

M* Smyth hath this day drawne out of his nurseryes a great number of
yonge stocke and of apple trees grafted with pippens, pearmaynes and
other the best apples, w°t he hopeth for his owne humor and affecéon sake
therin you will have somwhat the more care of, as also of the bagg of
abricote damosell & other plumstones he nowe sendeth.

We hoped of your tres from the way of newfoundland from whence dyu?s
ships are arryved at Barstable & Bristoll .6.3 and two dayes nowe past, as
by pte of the newe fish we nowe furnish appeareth, but till the date hereof
cannot heare from you or of your arrivall.

Wth our affectionate comendaéons we bid you hartely farewell and rest

Good Mt? Ferrar: I knowe y® will partake w” me deeply in my sorroe, not

& danger of my deerest: whose coorse was this.

On Thursday, the 7‘ of this instant, the Bona Nova w' hir Pinnace set

I hope to doo. I have written also to M' Barbor to that effect: & have

the parts allotted them.

Aboue all have in remembrance the matter of Silk woorm seed, that it
may be sent by D. Bohun, who they say goeth in October.

I pray y* also let the Secretarie & M*‘ Carter be directed, for the making of
the three Catalougs of the severall Adventuro's indebted: that in the
beginning of the term they may be delivered as is appointed to their
severall solicito's. MM Carter may not alege that he knoweth they have
paid all, ffor the demands must be made according to the Companies
books: otherwise there wilbe manie a 12! 10° buried in other mens purses.
These demands also wilbe a great meanes of dooing that right w'" we so
much desire, & of bringing to conclusion those untoward Accounts.

The enclosed to D* Gulston, concerning the safetie of my poor wife, I
knowe y® wilbe carefull to see delivered w™ speed: & desire M* Carter to
solicit him for his answer, that it may not faile to come downe by this
post. Desire Mt Carter also not to acquaint anie of my wifes frends wt?

The robbing of o" house there, hath put my frends to trouble: & we doubt
of more losse then is conceived.

ffor Mt Carter writes nothing what roomes he brake into, whereby we
can not coniecture what goods are gone. I am much beholden to M*
Melling for his pains. I pray y* desire him to continue the pursuit, that
at my Coming I be not distracted from the busines y" so well affect. I
will not request yo? help herein: w** I presume of in most effectual sort if
occasion so require.

This yeare in me dooth verifie the Italian proverb: Il mal non vien mai
scompagnato

My wife desires M’ Carter, that there be a fire in the great chamber of
Cole, & in the little dining chamber of wood, by 3 of the Clock on Saturday
at afternoon: & that Nurse Judith or hir Sister be there then to attend hir.
I desire M* Carter also to commend me kyndly to D™ Gulston: & let him
knowe that his letter by M* Linde is lost, (w° much grieveth my wife:)
I sent to him to Canterburie. His answer was that he delivered the letter
to Pike that * * * to deliver it to Pauson. I sent then to Pauson:
who saith he heard of none.

One thing hath been often in my mynd: & now I will put it into yo". My
L. Chamberlain hath not had an account yet of his monie for the Summer
Hands, for ought I knowe. I pray y" that it may be readie to be presented
to him, ffor I shall have cause to move him concerning Virginia. So in

In which enter prize to tell how great things manie of vs have suffered
through hunger alone, would bee as incredible as horrible to reporte to
yo" sacred eares, which difficultie, wee by the fauo" of God haueing in
some sorte overcome, and brought our selves to some abilitie of substance
without anie other helpe from England, but onelie by course of Mer-
chandize, are now like to be returned to the same or worse difficulties, by
the sinister practize of principall persons of our Companie at home, who
Ptending yot Mate proffitt, but intending their owne more, have gone
about to blowe vs vp at once, with a pelaifiaéon which they haue peured
from yo" Mat (as wee hope, vpon some false grownds) prohibiting our
Importaéon of tobace®, the onely CoModity which wee haue had hetherto
meanes to rayse toward¢ teward€ the aparelling of o" Bodyes and other
needfull supplem**, Other thinge of more reall valewe and constant sale
requireing more time §in§ the growth then our necessities would allowe,
and more helpe to practize then wee (till of late) have beene furnished
withall, By w° course wee are plunged in so great extremities that now
remayneth neither helpe nor hope, but that wee must all here perish for
want of clotheing, and other necessaries, such as both our natures some-
times, and breeding maie require, whereby yo’ Ma" shall not onelie loose
so manie good and loyall Subiects, as haue hither adventured theire liues
and substance in Gods seruice and yot Ma‘: but with them the hope of
a Territorie as large and as opulent to bee made, as anie of those King-
domes you now possesse.

Maie it therefore please yo" Ma" out of yo" Princelie Compassion (since
wee are assured, that you tender the lives and wellfares of yo™ Subiects
beyond thouzands of gould and silver, and yo" Royall word ratified by
yo’ great Seale, farr above both) either to revoke that Proclamaéon, and
to restore vs to our ancient liberty, or otherwise to send for vs all home;
and not to suffer the Heathen to triumph over vs and to saye Where is
now their God? So shall wee all (as wee allredie are in dutye bound)
praye for yo" Maties long life and happie Raigne.

Whereas, at the humble suit and request of sundry Our louing and well
disposed Subiects, intending to deduce a Colony, and to make a Planta-
tion in Virginia, Wee, for the inlarging of Our Gouernment, increase of
Nauigation and Trade, and especially for the reducing of the sauage and
barbarous people of those parts to the Christian faith, did incorporate
diuers Noblemen, Gentlemen and others, aduenturers in the sayd Plan-
tation, and granted vnto them sundry Priuiledges and Liberties; amongst
which, for their better helpe and assistance to raise some competent
summes of money to prosecute the same Plantation to a happy end, Wee
did grant them licence to set foorth, erect and publish Lotteries, to con-
tinue for one yeere after the opening of the same, and further, during Our
pleasure; which liberty hath been by the same Company put in vse diuers
yeeres past. Now forasmuch as We are giuen to vnderstand, that although
Wee in granting the sayd Licence, had Our eye fixed vpon a religious and
Princely end and designe, yet the sayd Lotteries, hauing now for a long
time been put in vse, doe dayly decline to more and more inconuenience,
to the hinderance of multitudes of Our Subiects,

Wee whose care continually waiteth vpon the generall welfare of Our
people, haue thought it expedient, for the generall good of Our Subiects,
MARCH 24, 1620/21 435

to suspend the further execution of the saide Lotteries, vntill vpon further
deliberation and aduisement, We shall be more fully informed of the
inconueniences and euils thereby arising, and may ordaine due remedy for
the same, without any conceit of withdrawing Our fauour in any degree
from the said Company or plantation, and good worke by them intended.

And therefore We doe heereby expresly charge and command the sayd
Company and their successors, and all their Officers, Ministers, and
Seruants, and all others, That from hencefoorth they desist and forbeare,
to vse or execute any manner of grant or Licence from Vs, for the keeping
and continuing of any Lotterie, or to keepe or continue any Lotterie,
within this Our Realme of England or the Dominions thereof, vntill such
time as Wee shall declare Our further pleasure therein. And Wee likewise
require all Justices, Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, from hencefoorth,
diligently and carefully to see this Our pleasure executed, and to punish
the infringers thereof, as contemners of Our Royall command.

Giuen at Our Palace of Westminster the eighth day of March, in the
eighteenth yeere of Our Reigne of Great Britaine, France and Ireland.
God saue the King.

Not any waye moved with the power of your place, Right Noble 8,
although I hartelie wish such honno™ might euer be so worthelie conferd:
but as I must confess invited, naye incited by those inward beautyes,
pietie, and pittye w do so loudlie speak you to the world more then
man, did I adventure to present vnto your gentle acceptance the free
offering of my willing services: how curteouslye itt pleased you to intertaine
them I was certefyed by verball relation from M’ Hudlestone, he farther
intimatinge, that if there had not bynn some differences betweene our
Gennerall S' George Yeardley, whome you much respect, and my self,
you had vndoubtedlie amplified your favours in a larger measure: although
your least of loue is farr beyond my best of merritt, yett so ambitiouslie
covetous am I of your good repute, that I beseech you thinke it not
ymptinent, if to remoue such vnpleasinge obstacles I somewhat dilate
vpon those occurrences. St Paules affection against Alexander the Smithe,
doth sufficientlie argue the lawfulnes of a complainte, wherein deliberate
discretion inquireth after the matter not the man, for we must not haue
the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the god of glorie, with respect of
persons, least we coMitt sinne, and be convinced of the law as transgres-
sours. there is a woe pronounced against the world because of offences,
APRIL 12, 1621 437

but that woe pertaines vnto that man by whome the offence commeth, in
the determininge whereof qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera
equa licet statuerit haud equus fuit, for that is to be partial in our sclues,
and to become iudges of euil thoughte: but the rule of amitye commende
vnto vs a good opinion of those we effect, so doth the lawe of charitie
coMaunde vs to be well minded toward¢ all men, especialie strangers
causes of necessitie and cases of incertaintie: Yett both of them are
limited with this prove as vse, ad aras amicus. I will not saye but that
itt is much to be desired, that either good men were cofviaunders or els
that commaunders were good men but He that plucketh the mightye one
from his seate plainlve shewes that Error may sometimes sitt regalie
inthroned x x x Auri nobilitas luteam si vestiat ollam, hane tamen
haud sequitur non minus esse lutum for we are all by nature the sonnes
of wrath: servinge the prince of the aire, w’ is the spirrit that rules in the
hartes of the disobedient But I will no longer insist vpon this poynte,
houlding itt no good plea for any one to seek excuse through an others
guilt: nor indeed ean I otherwise (Noble 8") but ingeniouslye acknowledg,
that there is nothing herein sayed, that any waye ptaines vnto your self,
whose satisfaction I onlye aime att for so much vprightnes of hart, and
sinceritie of iudgment, hath bynn manifested by those letters you sent
over concerning theis occasions, that itt evidentlie appears, those admir-
able vertues whereby Innocencye is mightelie defended, and Justice
ympartialie distributed, haue an innated residence within you. I will
therefore cast about againe, and steere some other course to harbour my
self from theis seas of trouble, to the effecting whereof I will onlie request
so much of your humanitye, as not to conceave me of so ill a disposition
either by ill nature or worse nurture, to desire contention with any, much
less with my superior, I knowe, that ludere cum sanctis, est nihil aliud
qua lupum auribus tenere, and might thereby hope to be charitablie
adiudged, that I would not idelye Diis bellum gerrere but leaving that,
I will wholie relie one your wisdomes apprehension when itt shalbe trulie
given you, how those differences were begun and ended, when I doubt
not but my desires will appeare without any straine that maye merritt
the ymputation of a vice, In the meane time, for that I well knowe you
haue had no smale hand in the removinge of those greevances, I cannot
but thankfullie wish you maye happelie receave that blessed reward of the

goodnes toward me, for those differences being ended, I hope there is
* * * any thing left that cann raise a wale of sepation betweene your
favour and my fortunes, and because I knowe my desert@ are verie weak,
and that theye who attend the Bridegrome worthelie must haue oyle in
theire lampes, I will onlie now report this vato you w® I haue noted
amoungest theis Savadges. The greate Werowance Powhawtan in his
annuall progress through his pettye provinces cofiing to Patowamack, was
there as in other places intertained with the greatest honnor that Nation

vndaunted valours [14] theye had achieved against theire Ennimyes the
Massoamacke and the wilde Beastes of theire fforest, euery one strivinge
to strayne his actions highest therebye expecting the greater reward and
commendations. Amoung’st these he whose lott was last though not of
least account havinge noted his ffellowes in theire extraordinarye boast-
inges, to devoure even more then all that might be sayed to any purpose
in that kinde, cofiinge forth and with a stoute and decent behaviour
making his obeseyance thus related And I my Lorde went this morninge
into a great Marshe and there valientlye killed six Muske Ratte, wc?

Right worp!

I wrote unto you by Cap: Hamor of y° receite of thos men w I
receaved out of y* London Merchant y* Jonathan, and y* Triall with a
list of their names, and how ill provided I was to receave them. I have
since taken better order both for thos y' are yet remaining with me, and
for thos which shall be hereafter sent finding y* number of sixe in one
hous (as I had at first placed them) to be to many I have doubled y°
number of houses, and put but three to one hous, and for y° new men
which are to come I[ have alreddy built a guest hous of forty foote long,
and twentie foote wide to receave them at there first landing, and have
placed an ould woeman in it to wash their clothes and keep the hous
cleane and have built a little roome for y* surgeon yt he may be ever neere
and helpfull to them: and am now in building more houses upon y* ground
where I meane to seate thes men them which are to come, y' they may
at first (if I ean) enter upon there owne portion with out any stay or long
expecting of what shall become of them. Since y° writing of my last
letter I have receaved ten young Kine, they thrife very well and I thinke
are all with calfe, I have railed in for them with a firme substantial rale
two hundred acres of ground. Concerning y* ould men I wrote nothing
to you beeaus I had not then receaved them home which were putt out,
the names ef names of thos yt are both living and dead are herein inclosed:
Afer I had gathered in y® Cropp I enquired of 8" George what his pleasure
was I should doe with it, and he answered yt he thought you did expect
442 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

nothing from them §tenants§ this yeare, becaus some of them offered to

pay into y® stoare so much as was there owing and divide the rest amongst
them, There was owing into the stoare for fiveteen hundred of fish, at
three pound fifteen shillings y° hundred, for woodden platters, spikes, iron
pots §and§ kans foure hundred and fourescore waight of tobaceo, y°
tobacco which was due unto them that died for y° time they lived, he gave
unto me, for which I thanke you and him unto whom I have many waies
been behoulding, whos life, goverment, and proceedings I Can not but
admire, the fish he sent to me with y° newe men becaus there provisions
of meale and oyle were short: £ reeeaved ene ¥¢ I have for this yeare
caused as many to worke upon other trades beside y° ground as I Could,
both for y® hansomer building in my plantation, and benefit of y* Colonie,
and myne owne ess ease: I have appointed foure Carpenters, three
sawyers two Smiths three tailors [1#] Y° rest plant Corne and Tobacco,
for vines we can not goe about it with courage untill such time as we h
may have such plants as we knowe are good and will be worth our labour,
which we expect out of Ingland, it is with out question, that they will
prosper exceeding well, by y° next yeare I thinke 8" George will be able
to furnish some of us out of his owne vineyard as also with silke-worme-
seede. I have both y*® last yeare and this yeare planted some young
nurceries of vines which live and growe, but I can have no confidence in
them, that they should ever make good wines thes and other coffiodities
of y* like kind are to be ripened by time, and multitudes of people. thus
with my hartie thankes to you for your love and kindnes to me I humbly

either to employ him againe (whose faire carriage toward the people here

At the arriual of the seruants of Sir Lawrence Hyde, & Mr" Nicolas
Hyde his brother, I could not deuise, how to doe them better seruice,
then by recofiiending their men & the prouisions they brought to the
eare of M* John Boys Warden of Martins hundred, where those twoe
worthy gentlemen were to haue their diuidendes. Of these seruants of
theirs coming in (as others did) in a most feruent & contagious time, some
are dead. And howe & upon what termes those that remaine aliue are
disposed of, appeareth by the note inclosed, w though it be very rude
and muche blurred, yet because it is the handwriting of M* John Boys
himselfe, I thought good to inclose it. Their wages sett downe in the same
note I holde to be reasonable, and doe think, that being but newe men,
they might perhaps (ouer & beside a greater hazard of their liues) not
attaine so muche, if they were at their owne disposing. Against another
year they may haue full experience in the country; and then if it shall
please their M'™ to adde more company vnto them, I shalbe ready to giue
them the best assistance I can to settle them upon their owne lande;
about the laying out whereof I will take order w M* Boys who hath not
yet assigned any land at all for any particular aduenturer remaining in
England, and shall appoint those twoe gentlemen their diuidends w the
MAY 16, 1621 451

first. The reason why I haue bene so slowe in doing it is because we haue
neuer a surueyour in the lande and by that meanes cannot performe suche
a seruice to any purpose, but might therein muche wronge either the
owners, or suche as should be their next neighbours. And besides the
vndertakers at Martins hundred would thinke themselues muche wronged,
if any other should be sctt on worke to diuide their groundes. Besides, if
that company intende (as I doe heare) to buy out the Indians of Chi-
schiack, those twoe worthy gentlemen might perhaps speed a great deale
better by chusing them a seate in those partes. Thus muche I thought
good to signify in answer to M' Nicolas Hydes letter written to yo" Selfe
in England; and so recomending &e. I rest

Yo" very ready at your seruice

Noble Sir

by your last with the Margaret and John I have receaved exceeding great
content vnto my mynde, perceiving thereby how that you are pleased still
to continew my constant and faythfull Freind, notwithstanding the very
warm opositions of my enymies and that therein you have allso bine
pleased to suffer much for my sake, as I playnly see, For with your Love
as allso for all other your noble Favors shewne me in all my occassions, I
am not able in words to explrjesse my trew thankfullnes, But wil rather
endeavor By gods grace and assistance, to pforme yf possibly by man,
some service acceptable, and worthy the requitall of soe Noble a Freind as
I both doe and shall ever esteeme your selfe to be, and withall I humbly
beseech you not to suffer any either false slanderous reports or undermyn-
ing Machevill villaynes, either frd hence in wryghting or at home by
malitious reporting to your eares any thing w may seeme distastfull, to
beget in you any ill opinion of me who am and shall ever desire to be a
faythfull servant vnto your selfe, And although it hath pleased you to lay
many Crosses and afflictions of this busines w‘ I know yet desire soe much
to see psper, yet I doubt not but that in dew tyme we may with gods helpe
recover whatsoever by that meanes we have lost, and soe I rest upon your
pmisse in your Letter. The great content and beniffitt w" T have by the
meanes of the Company of these too worthy gent Capt Thorpe and Capt
Nuce, doth noe less invite me, then you have trusted, to giue most harty
thanks both to your selfe and to all these who were assistant to the sending
of them, you [illegible] pmisse of taking care to pvide me such a sucssesor
as may be equall to thesse in the ranke of his place, I must acknowlege
therein your singular Love to me, but for my part as formerly I have
desired soe I wish still that one of these (who either of them wil wel dese[rjue
it) may have the place, being men all ready espetially for the one wel
seasoned to the country

That my most Hono>* Lorde doth please still to conceave well of me, doth
yet in the midst of all thesse Crosses revive me, and doth me thinkes
MAY 16, 1621 453

kindell and quicken anew my desire and corage to enterprise some what that
may be acceptable, wherein I beseech allmyghty god to assist me. what in
my Letters I wrott that myght give Lesse satisfaction then was expected
sure I am I was enforced soe to doe, and shall ever desire to wryght and
speake the truth, the wth I know in the end when you find it to be soe,
you will aprove of, yett wil I strive by my actions to ad to that satisfaction.
I must allso retorne most gratefull Thankes vnto my Freindes who acord-
ing to request have resolved not to emportune me any longer to haue my
place of Governour, to heare of the Choyse of my sucssesser wil be most
welcome newes unto me. That order of the Company for an acount of
the [* * * Jeering of the Goverment and plantations I shall be obedient
vnto, and have yet hope before my full tyme be expired to heare of some
thing worth the setting doune and for this your seasonable warning doc
rest thankfull to you. I have saluted the gent’ in your Letter named,
except Capt Blewet, and M* Nelson. Francis Newman before the receipt
of your Letter as you shall understand by the answer of the petition I
receaved frd you concerning him, dyed at Henriko Capt Nuce having
letters fr6 Freinds eoncerning the busines, I have caused both the servants
and theire pvisions to be delivered into his possession who pmiseth both to
be carefull of them and to give acount to his Freinds of the suesses there
of. For other matters it wil be needless for me to writt vnto you by these,
being you shall vnderstand of all thinges at full by the generall dispatch,
w I hope wil give you some satisfaction of most thinges, for this tyme
there fore I shall cease to troble you any farther humbly beseeching All-
myghty god to give you long lyfe and hapines with health to the good of
this Noble plantation, and soe with my and my wyfes best service both to
yourself and your good Lady I humbly take my Leave of you and wil

Hot!e Ss"

Although I haue now written to my L. of South’ and the Coun-
cell in gen9all: w°® tres I knowe come not last to yo" view: yet yor"
manifold favo" conferrd vpon me, and yo" Contynuall paynes and care
for the good of vs all here, I thought might iustlie Challenge my more
perticuler regard. And therfore, though in my gen%all tres I haue
playnely accordinge to my nature delyverd such thinge as I thought fitt
for them to take notice of: yet I shall be bold to goe a lyttle further with
you, in boltinge forth my pryvate Conceipt ef the Country Sof thing?e not
vnnecessarie for you to knowe$ since it must be §a§ true informaéon
from hence that must confyrme or reetyfie yo" iudgment¢. You will
Consider I haue not had tyme to see much, and therefore IT will not
passe the bound¢ of myne owne observaéon.

The Country, if wee Consyder the ayre, I Coneeaue to be of an indifferent
tempature, and such as younge and stronge bodies may well away with
all. But men stricken in years, or Corrupted in their blood€ by Nature or
disorder will finde a feirce encounter. If wee Consider the earth, I iudge
it also very fruytfull and apt to pduce any thinge w England affords:
and yet haue wee ¥e# very little of yo" Corne or other graine: and I gesse
the reason to be, for that seldome any of our seed@ Come kyndly or
seasonablie hether. ffor I my self this springe puttinge sondry * * *
sorte of gardaine seed¢ into the ground, finde not one of them to come vp.
But aboue all it would be wisht that our Corne might here be found to
psper: and that wee had here more Cattle both for the plough and payle:
for I assure yow the people kere lyve very barely for the most part:
havinge no other foode but bread & water and such mann? of ineate as
they make of the Mayze: we" I would to God I Could say they had in
any reasonable plenty. I assure yow the world goes hard with many
even at this tyme. The labo" is infynite that they are here putto for
Corne yeerly. In so much that it takes vp att y* least three part¢ of our
handé. w* if you Consider, yow will not wonder that so great work€ as
456 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

yow expect to be done haue so slowe pgresse. The Gou9not hath stayed
the Dutch[1>]men yet awhile to see if any fitt water may be found for
their tourne (for yet they mecte with none) ffor to send them home
without doeinge that they were sent for would tourne to yo" dishonours
and the Countries discreditt. In the mean tyme they are so disheartned
with the entertaynment they finde here, that they are growne very
ympatient of stay. And these men when they fall to worke, must haue
all their help from the Companies people: and it may ffall out to be in
such a place that all yow haue yet will not satisfie. And Show$ shall
they doe that and look after their own lyvelihood? The Collony will
afford no help toward@ it, since (as they say) the benefitt thereof goes
to y° Company. Iam in a straite. How so many people sent hither of
late yeers haue bene lost, I cannot Conceaue vnies it be through water
and want, partly of good foode, but cheifly of good Lodginge: w haue
bene the onely Causes of the death of so many as came with me, if the
Coneeipt of their 7. years servitude did not help them on: w*® Course,
I am of opinion, yow should doe well to alter. The half yeere, for w™
onely wee were victualled, since our landinge, is now allmost expyred;
sure I am, our pvisions are expended, and yet wee here of no supplie.
Tn so much that yf the Edwin had not stood vs in some stead by fetchinge
vs corne forth of the Bay (wher now we haue good and free trade) wee
had bene distrest. ffor yo" pvisions fall exceedinge short, w'" is not my
Complaint alone.

ffor myne owne part I will be bold to say that none could ever be more
honestly or thriftily issued, yet if many men had not died wee had bene
Jonge since in want. I ymmagine I should haue wronged my self and
abused the Company, if I had not said somethinge in my tres eoncerninge
Huddlestone, in whom you haue bene deceaued, for he ys a dissemblinge
Companion. I haue giuen yow but a touch of his behavyo™ out of my
respect to M' Deputy: with whom I haue dealt freelie. Though he
deserue not the best from me, yet I could eazely disgest that, had he
discharged his dutie otherwise. Thincke not therfore I beseech you that
I mallice his person. I haue more to saie then I haue tyme to vtter.
Now therefore hopeinge that you and my good Ladie haue had no worse
health +he# then I and my wife (I prayse God for it) haue hitherto enioyed,

[22] St, I had allmost forgotten to tell yow houe farre wee thinke those
Commodities men@oned in yo" booke, vndervallued. Especially Silke Codde:
wherin to deale, the people are now very much discouraged. Howbeit I

who hath no other waie but to digg and dealue.

Sure they thought themselues in Italie, Spayne, or flraunce: Countries
plentifull and populous: wher are thousands of women and children and
such ydle people to be hyred for }" or ij2a day. Tam enformed that 20.

Nay, men here in that season are not to be gotten at any rate: for the

tending to the peruerting or delaying of Justice: Wee praie you also to
haue espetiall Care that no iniurie or oppresion bee wrought by the English
against any of y® Natiues of that Countrie, wherby the present peace
may bee disturbed and ancient quarrells (now buried) might bee reuiued.
Provided neuertheles that y° honor of ot Nation and safety of o' people
bee still preserued and all maner of Insolence committed by the natiues
be seuerely and sharpelie punished.

8 Item that you cause o" people to applie themselues to an industrious

Copy of a tre to the Governo™ and Counsell of State residinge in Virginia.
July 25% 1621
After ot harty Comendaéons, we received yo" letters by the Bona Noua
so lately, as we haue not had leasure to peruse them, beinge opress[ed]
w't a multitude of bussines, that night and day employes vs. Wee shall
therefore by this letter only touch some principall point¢ reservinge o*
selules] to a time of more leasure fully to deliberate and giue youe answere
referringe youe for a supply of matters therein omitted, to 07 generall
instrucéons, w°> we desire youe diligently to peruse and punctually to
obserue. Wee haue sent youe (S" Francis Wyatt) to be the future Gov-
erno’, to whom we require all respect and obedience be given. m' Sandys
we haue ellected o* Treasuro’, and Stated his place, and given him authority
to see and cause all o" orders concerninge staple comodities to be putt in
executon. m’ Davison is chosen by the Quarter Court for Secretary.
Theire dispatches haue wholy possest vs for a night; and we hope that
by the addition of such able ministers, youe wilbe enabled to performe
what we pticulerly enioyne: the want of able officers haufe] beene here-
tofore pleaded for the cause o* directons haue beene no bette[r] obserued.
Wee desire that these gentlemen may be well accomodated att theire
landinge, and theire people well lodged. Wee haue likewise sent youe two
sufficient preachers: m‘ Haut Wyatt; who is to be Preacher to the Gov-
erno™ Tenjits: and m" Bolton, whom wee haue consigned to Elizabeth
Citty, to inhabitt w Capt Tho: Nuce to whom we recomende him, vnd*-
standinge that m" Stockton is otherwise seated. And for supply of the
Phisitions place we haue sent youe Docto" Pott, w™ two Chirurgeio[ns]}
and a Chest of Phisicke and Chirurgery; not doubtinge but youe will
enterteine and supplie him well att his landinge, wt all necessaries
and accordinge vnto the Companies promise, giue him helpe for the speedy
buildinge of a house imediatly vppon his arivall: the Twenty Ten*nt¢ form-
486 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

erly sent must be deliuered him, and the Land belonginge to his place sett
out, and what are wantinge of the number of Twenty, are to be supplied out
of the Companyes Ten*nt¢ w wee doubt not but may be done w theire
very good sattisfatio[n] Itt is 0” expresse will that the Ten*nt¢ belonginge to
every office be fixed to his certaine place vppon the Land sett out for itt, for
wt mt Cleyburne is Chosen to be o* Surveyo', who att the Companies very
great charge is sett out as by his condition of agreement youe may perceiue.
Great hath beene the care of the Company to sattisfie yo" desires that they
haue spared for no paines nor charge: The Publique land¢ sett out, and that
w belonge to publique psons; his next employment must bee to sett out
land@ belonging vnto pticuler Plantations, and then that of private per-
sons: for the publique, he is to do by vertue of his place w“out other
then the former Salarie; neither may he exeed when he is employed by
any private psons the rate of vj° the day, w'* some must be duly paid
him in good and valuable Comodities. And for that we find by experience
that notw*standinge o* stric[é] comand¢ to the contrary, diu™ Shipp€ sett
out for monthly wadges, mos{é] long and vnnecessary staies, to o" excessiue
charge; and that for want of due care shipp€ come so vnsufficiently
provided, as we haue reason to feare that some of them haue foundred in
the Sea, and also to prevent the frau|ds] and abuses of m™: of Shipp¢, and
Mariners in detention of good¢ sent to the Planters, and in sellinge theire
goodé att excessiue rates. Therefore Wee haue ellected m™ John Pountis
ot Vice-Admirall, provisionally for one yea[re] till by a Quarter Court his
place may be confirmed vnto him, and seated w Ten*nt¢, beinge assured
that by his sufficiencie, integrity, & indust[ry] these and many such
growinge mischeifes wilbe prevented.

[154] With great difficulty wee haue erected a private Magazine, men
beinge most vnwillinge to be drawne to subscription to be paid in smoke,
yf therefore youe expect for the future any such place, it must be yo"
principall care the Cape-Marchannt be not constreined to vent his Comodi-
ties att any sett price, and in pticuler not to be enforced to take Tobacco
att any certaine rate; and that youe be aidinge aswell to this as to the
former Magazine for the returne of Debt€. Wee require that the Markett
be opne for all men, that the charitable intention of the Adventurers be
not abused, and turned into privat gaine: therefore we desire youe to haue
principally in yo" care, that a strict Proclamation be sett out, to prohibitt
JULY 26, 1621 487

such engrosseing of Comodities, and forestalling the Markett, thereby
to vent it to the poore people at exessiue rates: such oppression and
grindinge of the poore wee in o° heart¢ abhorr, and require youe severely
to punishe; assuringe youe nothing can be more pleasing vnto vs, then
the exemplarie punishment of such Monsters as devo" theire brethren by
this wiked and barbarous course, especially if such wickednesse should be
exercised by men in place of authority.

The advancement of the Iron Workes wee esteeme to be most neces-
sarie, by pservinge whereof we esteeme the Plantation is gained: Wee
therefore require all possible assistance be given to m™ Berkley, now sent,
and all furtherance to his Ging, espially good enterteinment at theire
Landinge, that they may be well lodged and cherished w* such comfort-
able helpe as yo" place will afford, wt we will thankfully requite to any
that shall advance this o* so much desired Worke.

And here againe wee renue againe ot former Comendatons of m™ Lapworth
and that in very effectual manner.

In the next place we Comend vnto yo' care o7 Saw-Mill€, a worke of such
importance as it deserues yo" speciall furtherance, and therefore we desire
the Dutchmen sent for the fabricke of them may be extraordinarily well
vsed, & carefully provided of apparell out of the new Magazine, w™ we
would haue paid for by the Companies Tobacco: as for such other neces-
saries as they want especially beere w*® cannot now be shipped for want
of time and Tunnage; wee haue desired S* Francis Wyatt to supply them
w'®, wt he shalbe repaid: and thus supplied wee hope they wilbe encoraged
to bringe that so much desired worke to its pfeeéon

Wee exeedingly approue yo" course in takinge in of Indian families as
beinge a great meanes to reduce that Nation to Civility and to the imbrace-

And to youe m™ Thorpe wee will freely confesse, that both yo" letters and
endevo's are most aceeptable to vs: the enteringe vppon those Staple
Comodities of wyne, and silke, wee highly cofiend: and assure youe it

if either the Clergie heare supply o* Stocke, or a returne from the Colledge
Tennt@ shall enable vs. In the meane while they desire youe to proceed
in these noble courses, assuring youe of all loue and respect. The vesselle
of earth youe sent wee haue not as yett received; when tryall is made
youe shall heare from vs: And we pray youe all in generall that such
extraordinary Oare, or Earth, as yee find youe send vs over in plentie;
for that w™ was sent by youe, Capt Nuce, was in so smale proporéon,
as we hardly could make any triall thereof; we conceived it to be terra
Lemnia, and it is exceedinge good for the flix, youe shall therefore do
well to bringe it in vse in the Colony: wee desire youe Captain Newe
therefore to send vs over three or foure Tunn of the said white earth;
And we desire youe the Governo™ and Counsell to haue an especiall care
that no greater proportion thereof then we from time to time direct youe
be brought over: for if it be brought over in greater quantity it will not
pay the fraight. This Comodity is intended to be apropriated to the
generall Company, and if any benefite shalbe raised thereby it shalbe
employed in fortificaéons, and other publique, and pious ases work¢, for
the advancement of the Colony. And for that the Comp’: conceives of
youe Capt Newe as great hopes as of any theire publique instrument,
and haue by yo" letters received great sattisfacton, therfore [16] They haue
in bountie added to yo" former proportion of Land 300 acres w™ is to be
appropriated to yo" place for ever: for manuringe w they by Quarter
Court haue ordered, that youe shall haue ten men sent over the next yeare,
only they desire that youe wilbe so provided of Corn and other necessaries,
as they may be only at the charge of transport, armes, apparrell and work-
inge tooles; and not for victuall¢, because their stocke is exhausted. We
haue sent b¥ a Shipp of Cattell from Irland, whereof we desire that Cap‘
Newe be first served w* his pmised number

The hopes youe haue putt the Company in of a trade of ffurrs to be had
in Hudsdons and De La Ware River, haue made many private Adventurers
of great worth and well affected to the Plantation, to sett out a Shipp to
that pticuler end, to w* we desire youe to give all possible furtherance

The vioadges and discoveries already made w"*in the Land, as also vppon
the Sea Coast, we highly Comend; and desire a constant course be held
therein, for in that consist¢ the very life of the Plantation. we comend
JULY 26, 1621 489

to yo" care especially the buildinge of Guest-houses, w™ we stricktly
charge youe to be brought to pfecton: we conceive that bussines would
haue beene effected, if half so much care and time had been taken to do
it, as hath beene spent in givinge reasons to the contrary. The plea of
impossibility we admitt not; the Discontent we assure o° selues is rather
a bug-beare, then an essentiall cause of forbearance; the spoile of o° goude
by often remoues is a weake allegation: but that it should be a more
regulated kind of killinge of men (as some haue beene pleased to writte)
wee deeme strange error of iudgment. Wee cannot conceale from youe,
that it is heare reported, that contrary to the publique faith given, not
the sicke, but the ablest men are lett out to hire and theire provisions
converted to private vses; And where it is pretended this placinge them
w* old planters is for theire health, they are so vnmercifully vsed that it
is the greatest cause of o* Tennt¢ discontent, and dislike of theire Tenancy
by halues: and though we hope this is not in all parts true: yett can we
not conceive such vnwillingnes to proceed in this worke, should they not
haue some other ground¢ then is alledged: lett it therefore be yo" worke
at yo" first generall Sessions of the Counsell, to effect this bussines, and it
shalbe o' care to provide for the well orderinge and furnishinge of them.

We comend vnto youe Capt Wm. Norton, who is now sett out by the generall
Company, and many private Adventurers for the erectinge of a Glasse
heuse Glasse worke: we desire he may be placed w his Ginge, in the
Guest house that Liuetennt Whittakers hath erected; there to reside till
he hath found a convenient place to erect his furnace, In the choise whereof
we desire youe to giue him yo’ best assistance, and especially haue a
care to seat him neare some well inhabited place, that neither his Ginge
be subiect to surprize, nor the Comoditie of glass and beade@ be vilified by
to Comon a sale to the Indians

And wee canot forbeare to deliu' ynto you the good opinion the Company
has received of Liuetennt Whittakers for the good accompt given by him
of his charge, but especially of his obedience to theire direc@ons, in erectinge
a guest house; for reward whereof they haue confirmed vnto him that w
S George Yeardley last yeare gaue him, and promised two servant¢ to
be transported next yeare: thereby to encorage him and others to proceed
in vertue and continue in their obedience, whereof the Company and
o'selues much like their argument¢ and discourses.

August 12** 1621
After o* harty Comendaéons &e In o° last letters sent youe by the George
we promised a full and sattisfactary answer to all yo" propositions, but
AUGUST 12, 1621 493

by reason of the absence of the most part of the Counsell, as also that
bussines dayly beyond o* expectacon infinitly inereaseth, we are con-
streined only to touch vppon some few pticulars reservinge o° selues for
more oportune tyme, when w** a clearer iudgment we may fully deliu’
our mind€ to you. You shall receiue by the hande of m' Leech now
bound for Virginia in the Marmaduke a Copy of o° last letters, together
w a Duplicat of the Instructons and Comissions, sent by the new Gov-
erno' S* Francis Wyatt, by whose happy arivall we hope you are informed
what care we haue taken to giue you full sattisfacéon in most or all of
yo" demand¢: and therefore we will hope fer of the like respectiue pfor-
mance of of desires from you. There are gon and in goinge from hence
many Shipp¢ for Virginia and we eanot but apprehend w great griefe
the sufferings of these multitudes at theire first Iandinge for want of
Guest houses wherein they might haue a while sheltred themselves from
the iniuries of the air in the cold season; w" omission and defect we hope
and very earnestly desire you will supply by a curteous and Christian
entertainment of them in yo" owne howses, till they may conveniently
provide themselves; and that against the next yeare you will haue erected
in the foure severall Boroughs as many Guest houses capable to receiue
those great numbers.

Wee send youe in this Shipp on Widdow and eleven Maide¢ for Wiues for
the people in Virginia: there hath beene especiall care had in the choise of
them; for there hath not any on of them beene received but vppon good
Comendacons, as by a noat herew sent youe may perceiuc: Wee pray
youe all therefore in generall to take them into yo’ care; and more espe-
cially we recomend them to youe m* Pountis, that at theire first landinge
they may be housed, lodged and provided for of dict till they be marryed:
for such was the hast of sendinge them away, as that straightued w™ time
we had no meanes to putt provisions aboard: wt defect shalbe supplied
by the Magazine Shipp: and in case they cannot be presently Marryed
we desire they may be putt to severall housholders that haue wiues till they
ean be provided of husbandé: There are neare fiftic more w*" are shortly
to come, are sent by o' most hono>' Lord and Treasuro™ the Earle of
Southampton and certaine worthy gentlemen, who takinge into theire
consideration, that the Plantaton can never flourish till families be planted,
and the respect of wiues and Children fix the people on the Soyle; therefore
12823333
494 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

haue given this faire begininge; for the reimbursinge of whose charges, itt
is ordered that wke every man that Marries them giue 120" waight of the
best leafe Tobbacco for each of them, and in case any of them dye that
proportion must be advanced to make it vpp vppon those that surviue;
and this certainty is sett downe for that the price sett vppon the boyes
sent last yeare being 10" w*" was so much mony out of purse here there
was returned 66‘ of Tobacco only and that of the worst and basest, so
that fraight and shrinkage reconed together w™ the basenes of the Com-
oditie, there was not on half returned: w iniury the Company is so
sencible of, as they demand restitution, w*" accordingly must be had of
them that tooke vppon them the dispose of them, the rather that no man
may mistake himselfe in accomptinge Tobacco to be currant 3* sterling
the pound contrary to o" expresse orders: And though we are desireous
that mariadge be free according to the law of nature, yett would we not
haue these maid@ deceived and married to servant¢, but only to such
[174] freemen or tennt€ as haue meanes to manteine them: wee pray you
therefore to be fathers to them in this bussines, not enforecing them to
Marrie against theire wille; neither send we them to be servante, saue in
case of neeessitie extremitie, for we would haue theire condigon so much
bettered as multitudes may be allured thereby to come vnto you: and you
may assure such men as marry those weomen that the first servant€ sent
over by the Company, shalbe consigned to them; it being o" intent to
preserue families, and to preferr married men before single psons: The
tobacco that shalbe due vppon the mariadge of these maides we desire
m' Pountis to receiue and to return by the first; as also the little quantitie
of Richard Pace the Copie of whose bill is here returned. To conclude
the Company for some weighty reasons too long to relate, haue ordered
that no man marryinge these weomen expect the proportion of Land
vseually alotted for eu’y head: w** to avoid clamo' or troble hereafter you
shall do well to giue them notice of.

In the next place, Wee comend vnto yo" care Capt W™ Norton and his
Italians together wt the rest of his Company, to whom we pray you to
be helpfull at his landing, to convey his people and goodé vp to the guest-
house of Liuetennt Whittakers; It is the only body in this Shipp the
general Company hath interest in, and therefore we will expect yo" best
helpes and advice, especially in making choise of a healthfull place to
AUGUST 12, 1621 495

plant himself in neare to the best inhabited towne, either in Charles Citty
or Henerico, but by no meanes lower then James Cittie, nor remote from
people; and in case Cap* Norton shall dy we pray you m™ George Sandys
to vndertake the oversight of the worke; and if he should faile by any
misaccident (w" God forbidd) then we intreat you m" George Thorp
and m* Jo: Pountis to take it into yo" care and in yo" absence to appoint
some trustie person to ou’see that bussines, for w°* curtesie the generall
Company, and private Adventurers wilbe very thankfull to you.

The makinge of beade is one of Cap'* Nortons cheife employmente w™
beinge the mony you trade w* the natiues we would by no meanes haue
through to much abundance vilified or the Virginiane at all pmitted to
see or vnd'stand the manufacture of them: wee therefore pray you seriously
to consider what proportion of bead¢ can be vented and their worth not
abated, and intimate the proportion to Capt Norton and his Italians, and
certifie the same to us in yo" next letters, that accordingly we may limitt
the quantitie that shall from time to time be made: Vppon sight of Capt
Nortons Invoice you shall peeive, what large provisions he is sett out w"*,
w'" in case of his failing we desire may be earefully preserved for his
people. And here we cannot hide from youe an information that is lately
given vs that such provisions as we send w‘* new men are taken from them
& Indian corne given them instead thereof, the extreame labo" of beatinge
thereof, being no smale disharteninge to the new comers; and this sud-
daine change of diett is affirmed confidently to be the eause of the flix in
oF men to o irreparable losse; we desire youe the whole body of the Coun-
sell, to take care that these abusses be reformed for the future.

The Adventurers of Martins hundred intend to proceed in theire Planta-
tion they haue sent twelve lustic youths in this Shipp w*® supplie they will
second w™ a greater of fourty more in the Magazine Shipp very soddainly to
followe: theire governo’ m' Harwood is enioyned to acequaint youe wt his
Instrucéons, to whom wee pray youe accordingly giue yo" best assistance.

Wee cannot but condempne the vse that is made of o° boat that are only
employed in trading in the bay for Corne almost every letter tell€ of that
trade w* wee only approue in case of necessitie; for we conceiue it would
496 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

be much better for the Plantation and more hono' for you and o° nation,
that the naturall@ should come for theire provision to you; then you to
begg yo' bread of them, we shall w a great deale more content heare of
Store-houses full of corne of yo" owne growth, then of a Shallopp laden
w* Corn from the Bay: wee pray you therefore that a larger proportion of
ground be assigned to every man to plant then formerly hath beene, and
that severest punishment¢ be inflicted vppon such as dare to breake yo"
constitutions herein; and that officers be not spared, nor theire tennt€ nor
servant€ dispenced wt. Our Magazine is soddainly to follow this [18]
Shipp, wherein there are much greater proportions of thing? sent then was in
the last: And though o° factot of the last Magazine was either by importu-
nity pswaded, or by constreint inforced, to part w his good@ at vnd" valews
to be paid in tobacco at 3° p T (w*" here, all charges deducted was sould
for lesse then then 204 p pound) yett will not the Adventurers be so in this
wrested; for they are determined to accept of tobacco at no certaine price,
nor will sell theire Comodities vppon trust, till that wicked phras[e] and
conceipt be rooted out of the mouths and hart€ of the Planters that any
thing is good enough for the Marchant. how vnworthy we and the Com-
pany are of this contempt we appeale to yo" selves, yet hath it not been
resented by you, nor the insolencie punished, but seeing 0° care and charg
is repaid by such monstrous ingratitude we desire you to giue notice to
the Collony that after this yeare they expect no further supply of any
necessaries to be exchanged wt them for theire darling tobbacco: wee haue
given them a yeares notice before hand, that they may fall vppon some
other course. And beinge sensible of the great losse the Adventurers still
sustenith by yo" roule Tobaeco made vp w"" fillers (as the terme is) itt is
by vs and the Adventurers ordered that the Cape marchant accept of
none but leaf Tobacco: wee pray youe to publish this o° order throughout
the Collony, that they may be provided to exehang w'* o' Cape Marchant
non but leaf: and such as wilfully transgresse this havinge notice, if they
suffer for it, it shalbe no part of o" care: There is an intention to send on
an exellent Shipwright w' a ginge of thirty or fortie Carpenters and
boatwright¢; The Company is in treatie w him, and the rowle of Adven-
turers is almost full; so that youe may certeinly expect him the next
Spring: in the interim we pray youe that great number of trees of the
white and black oake, growinge in wett ground¢ be felled and many more
AUGUST 12, 1621 497

barked to season by standinge. The time most fitting to fell and barke
yo" trees is in November and December, and the begininge of Januarie.
In the choise of the place we pray youe to haue respect vnto the nearenes
of the Iron worké, and of the Saw Mill€; most especially we pray your best
asistance in the pfectinge of those two worke, the profitt will redound to
the whole Collony, and therefore it is necessarie that you extend yot
authoritie to the vtmost lymitt¢, to enforee such as shall refuse theire help
to a bussines, so much tendinge to the generall good: yf those worke be
not pfected the body of the Shipwright¢€ wilbe of no vse, and if this oppor-
tunity be lost, mens hearte€ wilbe discoraged from further adventuring:
wee haue to sattisfie yo" desires and to supplie yo" necessities entred vppon
this proiect, wee therefore expect yo" best help to perfect yo" owne worke
whereby youe shall do a thing, glorious in it selfe, benefitt for yo" selues,
and the whole Collony; acceptabl to vs and the whole Company; and
being pfeeted it wilbe the securitie, reputation, and defence of yo" litle
Coffion Wealth, w° now in his infancie must be supported by fame and
hope of such Comodities: And so desiringe god to blesse youe and all
yo’ good endevo™ tendinge to the advancement and establishing of yor
Collony, Wee bidd you farewell.

Sent by the Warwicke

September 11‘ 1621

After o very hartie Comendaéons: you shall now by this Shipp the
Warwicke and the Pinace that cometh along wt her receiue those supplies
that we formerly in o' letters by the George and Marmaduke promised;
the setting forth of w hath beene of so exceedinge troble and labo" vnto
vs, being but a very few on whom so great a burthen hath lien, as we haue
not been able to intend any thinge else: wherefore in that regard, as also
that the noble Earle of Southampton, is not yet returned to London nor
those eminent psons, wttout whose Councell, and authoritie we thinke it
not fitt to proceed to resoluéon in so waightie bussinesses: o" letters and
dispatches by the Bona Nova, and the Margrett & John must yett remaine
vnanswered; but by the Dutie w about the Midle of the next month is
to depart, wee hope you shall receiue full sattisfaeton; w'* Shipp shall
bring w" her store of Silke worme seed and abundance of vine planté¢, for
both w we desire not only that generall pperatons be made, but that
timely notice, and order be given throughout the whole Colony that every
pticuler man may make provision for the arrivinge of some quantitie of
them both; and that a straight charge be given for the preseruing of vines
and Mulbery Trees, w°® we vnd'stand are w'® others promiscuously de-
frayed: and because the skill of handling them, is only derived from the
ffrench men, we canot but here recomend them to yo" fauo™ and
regard, that they may be kindly vsed and cherished: we haue as
by the Invoice youe shall pereeiue sent them and the Duch-men
(the delay of whose most necessarie workes is w'® much indigna-
tion here resented) diu®’ provisions of victuall@, as also a Cloth to
make them apparrell; for hose and shooes and other such matters
we desire they may be supplied by the Companies stock there,
SEPTEMBER 11, 1621 503

out of the Magazine w™ comes now along in the Warwicke large and
abundante in all vsefull and necessarie Comodities: for as for vanities
and supfluities, although we find they yeeld most profitt in Virginia; yet
we haue thought it most vnfitt to norish by such supplies that evill humo®
of prid{e] and ryott w°* we wish were vtterly extirpated: and this o° eare
therein hath had an eie rather to the benefitt of the plantation then the
profitt of the Adventurors; we shall not we hope proue preiudiciall, but
rather breed a willingnes and desire in the whole Collony to make vs
a speedy and profitable returne of the stock now sent (& not as hitherto
evill and disgracefull word¢ for 0° zeale of theire welfare, and nothing att
all or at least lesse then the principall laide out) for theire relief and
comfort: for youe shall vnd'stand, that (not only of the ould Magazine
w was about 7000 pound, we cannot hope to see much aboue half and
hitherto to haue not received any one peny) but even the new Magazine
sent last yeare by m' Blany is returned backe w*" losse of the principall
it self, after almost two years time and so many hassard€ born and yett to
beare; a thinge so vnkindly and distastfully taken here, as if the aecompte
had been sooner knowne we much fear thet supplies now sent had beene
farr short of what they now are: But that we may not now againe incurr
the like vnworthie damages; we desire you by whose wisdome and integ-
ritie, wee expect a generall redresse, to be by all lawfull and iust fauo™
aidinge and asistinge to the bussines it selfe; and to o° facto™ m' Blany,
that both his pson and the good@ may be safely & conveniently provided
for and accomodated; and that the sellinge and bartering of them be left
free to his diseretion, and accordinge to the prices and instruetons he
hath here given vnto him by the Adventurers, whose vnanimious resotuéon
and charg is not to accept of tobacco at 3° p pound; findinge besides all
former losses that neare 40 thousand waight sent home last yeare for the
generall Company and Magazine, the better half hath not yeelded xviij4
p pound, and the rest not aboue ij* to w*' prices there is no possibilitie that
they should ariue this next yeare: so that there must be an abatement of
the price of tobaeco there; neither can we yield (w** is by some planters
propounded) but by the whole Company, not only the Adventurers of
the Magazine denied to continue the ould rate of 3° per pound, and to ad
vallew as much in the good¢ sent hence, as the tobacco is esteemed lesse
worth then that rate for although for matters of profitt, it might go currant
much alike; yet thereby we should manteine [194] the Collony in theire
504 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

overweening esteeme of theire darlinge Tobacco, to the ou’throw of all other
Staple Comodities, and likewise continue the evill will they haue conceived
there, and the scandalous report€ here spread of oppression, and exactons
from the Company, selling all theire Comodities for three tymes the vallew
of what they cost, vppon w® fond and vniust surmises they thinke itt
lawfull to vse all maner of deceipt and falshood in theire tobacco, that
they put of the Magazin w* is the next thing wherein we desire yo"
care and favo', being assured from o* factot in Holland yt exept the
tobacco that shall next come thence, proue to be of more pfecéon and good-
nesse then that was come home last, there is no hope that it will vent
att all, for albeit itt passed once yett the wary buyer will not be againe
taken, so that we heartily wish that youe would make some provision
for the burninge of all base and rotten stuff, and not to suffer any, but
very good, to be cured, at least sent home whereby certainly there would
be more advanced in the price then losse in the quantity: howsoever we
hope that no bad nor ill condi¢oned Tobacco shalbe by compelling author-
itie (abusing it power given for publique good to private benefitt) putt
vppon o° facto": and very earnestly desire that he may haue the helpe
of iustice to constreine men to pay theire debt¢ vnto him, both remaining
of the last yeares accompt, and what shall this yeare grow dew, and that in
Comodities of the same vallew and goodnes as shalbe by him contracted
for. The ingrossinge of some of the principall Comodities in the last
Magazine is here much distasted, as a wrong to the stocke, to be deprived
of theire best Comodities at a low rate: but principally to the whole
Collony who were thereby made to pay dearer, and forced to take other
Comodities that they needed not: These disorders we point at and are
so long and earnest in this bussines of the Magazine, not out of the private
interest. w°* some of vs haue therein, but out of a true and sincere care
and zeale of the generall good of yt Plantaéon, w*" we are asured will
receiue notable advancement by a good and speedy returne for that will
much help, if it come to the fitt Markett of this stock now adventured, the
good peeed whereof will encourage and confirme the good mind¢ of the
ould Adventurers, by many losses almost beaten out, and draw in many
men into the Company, and w* most of all phappe concerneth the Collony,
establish a constant and larg trade w*® them, whereby not only all theire
wante, but even theire desires, wilbe at all times plentifully furnished: but
on the contrary if this succeed like the former, it is in vaine eu’ to hope
SEPTEMBER 11, 1621 505

for like suplies from hence: for want whereof if the Collony fall vppon
any calamitie or miserie, theires be the shame and guilt whose fault it is;
as for vs, it wilbe our comfort@ neither to haue failed in abundance of
charitie hitherto, nor in timely advise and warningt now given.

By this Shipp and Pinace called the Tyger, we also send as many maidé
& yong weomen as will make ypp the number of fiftie, wt those twelue
formerly sent in the Marmaduk; w*" we hope shalbe received w'" the same
Christian pietie and charitie as they are sent from hence; the providinge
for them at theire first landing, and disposinge of them in Mariage (w*" is
o cheife intent) we leaue to yo" care & wisdome to take that order as may
most conduce to theire good, and sattisfacton of the Adventuro™ for the
charges disbursed in settinge them forth, w°? coming to twelue pounds &
vpwards they require one hundreth and fiftie of the best leafe tobacco
for each of them; and if any of them dye there must be a proportionable
addition vppon the rest; this inerease of thirty poundé€ weight, since those
sent in the Marmaduke, they haue resolued to make finding the great
shrinkage and other losses vppon the tobacco from Virginia will not beare
lesse; w°' tobacco as it shalbe received, we desire nay be deliuered to m’
Ed: Blany who is to keepe thereof a pticuler accompt. We haue vsed
extraordinary dilligence and care in the choise of them and haue received
none of whom we haue not had good testimony of theire honest life and
cariadge, w together w' theire names we send here inclosed for the
sattisfacéon of such as shall Marry them; for whose further encoradgement
we desire youe to giue publique notice that the next spring we purpose to
send over as many youths for apprentices to those that shall now Marry
any of them and make vs due sattisfacéon: this and theire owne good
desert@ together w*" yo" favo™ and cares will we hope marry them all vnto
honest and sufficient men, whose names will reach to psent repayment:
but if any of them shall vnwarily or fondly bestow her self (for the libertie
of Mariadge we dare not infrindg) vppon such as shall not be able to giue
pisent sattisfaeton; we desire that at least as soone as abillity shalbe they
be compelled to pay the true quantitie of tobacco proporeoned, and that
this debt may haue peedence of all others to be reeovered: for the rest
w® we hope will not be many, we desire yo" best furtherance for providing
them fitting services, till they may hapne vppon good matches; and are
here perswaded by many old Planters that there wilbe maisters enow found
506 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

there who will readily lay down what charge shalbe required, vppon
assurance of repayment at theire mariadges w* as iust and [20] reasonable
we desire may be given them. But this and many other thing@ in
this bussines we must referr to yo" good considerations and faithfull
endevo’, hopeinge a worke begun here out of pittie and tending so much
to the benefitt of the Plantation shall not miscarry for any want of good
will or care on yo" parté.

The Society of Martins hundred whose designes by many misfortunes as
well here as in Virginia haue beene hitherto checked, do now againe go
forward cherefully; sendinge a supplie of people largly furnished with all
necessarie provisions; the succouringe, and cherishinge of them and theire
proceeding, we in effectuall man’ recomend vnto you, desiringe youe to
be by all possible favo" aidinge and asistinge vnto them: and in pticuler if
the Inhabitant€ of Wolster-Holmes Towne, theire old tenanté@ shall vn-
kindly refuse to enterteine for a while these new Comers in theire howses,
we desire that by yo' Comand they may be billited amongst them, and
they compelled to so charitable and bounden a dutie; as likewise if they
shall vse any aversnes or remissnes in the deliuty of such cattle as by the
Adventurers is here ordered, we desire you by your authoritie to make the
devision, and not to pmitt the people now sent to suffer any preiudice at
all for the want of them: The Comand and ou'sight of these people they
haue comitted to m' Richard Keane now resident in Virginia.

The Company is by diu™ waies informed that there is great want of
worthie Ministers in Virginia wherefore they haue enterteined, and now
send along, m' Thomas White a man of good sufficiencie for learning, and
recomended for integritie & vprightnes of life and of so good zeale to the
Plantaéon, that he is content to go w'* that smale allowance the Com-
panies stock is able now to aford him, and to put himself vppon such pre-
ferrment there, as he shall deserue, and you shall be able to accomodat
him w'®, w" if it be of the places belonging to the Company, we haue
promised him here an addic@éon to the smale allowance he hath now re-
ceived: and likewise that yo" godly care and wisdomes will provide for
him in some competent maner, till he may be furnished w‘* the full number
of tenante belonging to the Ministric; w°" for him and all others shall we
hope in the begininge of the Spring be accomplished: If he find enter-
teinment from any private hundred; then we shall expect from them the
SEPTEMBER 11, 1621 507

restitution of o* charges, that is six poundé for his passage and eight pounde
deliu'ed him toward¢ the making of some provisions. as for bookes we
doubt not but you wilbe able to supplie him out of the lybraries of so
many that haue died.

There are two ffrench youths now sent to Capt Tho: Nuce part of those
Ten promised him the next Springe; this anticipation although in a very
difficult time for want of mony, we haue yeelded wnto, vppon 8" John
Davers his motion, that Capt Nuce might be so much pleasured. Wee
send likewise one Miles Prickett to be employed in the Companies service
and especially in making of Salt wt we are informed he heretofore prack-
tised in Virginia, he is to serue till Allhollantide in the yeare 1622 w"out
any reward at all, w’" is here before hand paid him by his passage and
apparrell given him.

The releases of diu' psons here graunted we pray you to make good the
Condiéons seu'ally specified, as also to giue yo" best furtherance for the
accomplishment of all such bussines as by pticuler letters or pettiéons
vnd'written are recomended vnto youe, from the Counsell and Company,
whose last and ioynt request is in the behalf of Capt Guy and the Maister
of the Warwick, that vppon the good pformance of theire vioadg as well
kindly vsinge and cherishinge the Passengers, as safely deliu'inge all
theire good¢, they may be dispatched from Virginia; and what theire
necessities shall require may speedily and curteously be supplied; and if
you send any good¢ home in this Shipp or any other we pray youe to take
bond for the deliu'y of the same; and giue them order to stay at the Ile
of Wight or the Downes w‘out breakinge bulke, till they receiue direcéon
from hence at what Port they shall vnlade at. And so wishinge a happy
begininge and prosperous success in all yo" waightie affaires, we at psent
betake yo" and the whole Colony vnd' yor charge to the blessing of Gud

That whereas his Ma‘’* hath been pleased to graunt vnto the Tret & Com-
pany of Virginia diuers tres Pattents, togeather wth many gratious pviledges
& loueing instrucéons as well for the good gou9m' of the said Company
as for the advancemt of the plantaéon, all wth graunts being made to a
Treasurer his deputy fiue Counsello's and 15 eemittees Coffion’s they are
tyed to make their lawes aswell by the said graunts as by the Kings in-
structons according to the lawes of England, wth incoragements stirring
vpp many to adventure their moneys yo" peticon’ was induced by the
noblenes of the Acton to vndertake to be the first planter of a priuate
Colonye there, To wh end he caused a Pattent of free trade to be obteyned
from the Company vnder wh he intended to plant: Now so it is that St
Thomas Smyth late Trér of the said Company, and others practizemg w'h
him to worke their owne ends, haue contrary to his Mat said Pattent &
royall instrucéons framed a Tiranicall gouerment to be imposed on his
Ma: subjects in Virginia as by this booke printed by his direcéons may
appeare, By means whereof many pore people in Virginia were depriued
of their liues and goods & many were brought into Condemnaéon & slauery:
And whereas the sayd §' Thomas Smyth did formerly mallice yo" said
peti@oner wthout any just cause, yo" Orato’ now found himself his estate
and those he imployed (by means of priuate instrucéons giuen to the Gou9-
nor in Virginia) inthralled by this Tyrrany and thereby was made the
Anvill of the mallice & greedy desyres of the Gou9no’s both here and there
for whereas by the said Pattent, all things that pass from the said pattentees
are passed by most voyces in the name of the said Comf at the least 15
Comon's & 5 Counsello's whereof the Trér or Deputy being one, are able
to make any lawfull act, The said $' Tho. Smyth Alderm? Johnson and
others in an answeare on their oathes equivocating vppon the word Com-
pany they make it threefould the first being the Company ordeyned

meeting in the Trérs Chamber, This Company being the ground of all
the mischeefs that befell the plantaéon, may aptly be tearmed his Conclaue,
This second Company begat a third to witt a Company of ffacéon by frame-
ing a joynet stock tearmed the Magazine founded on a Contract made wth
S' Thomas Dale, which ioynt stock being tyed to set prizes, was at the first
ordeyned but as a seruant to the Comp, and had not any power giuen her to
doe any lawfull Act, but she afterward being able to carry the most voyces,
now of a seruant beeas (haueing the Trérer to frind) became the mistress
of the Company ordeined by the King, and so publique good was foreed
to serue priuate gane. By this means all the rights p'viledges and lib9tyes
togeather w‘h the gou%ment of the law is layd asside & had noe power to
worke all free trade is barred to any but the Magazine, The Planters goods
after 9 or ten yeares seruice in this former slauery being taken from them,
are sould and bought before their faces, and the prices contracted for wth
S' Tho Dale are sunck and raised at the will of this Conelaue, And whereas
heretofore there was eight or ten staple comodityes brought from Virginia
nothing comes home now but tobacco & sassafrass to fill Alderman Johnsons
shopp, and there goeing .8. or .10. shipps to Virginia in one yeare, all of them
comes home emptye except the Magazine shipp, by wth meanes the very
name of the Plantaton [2] in Virginia was brought into detestaéon here
And the Planters here groaning vnder the oppression of their gow2no's
here, write ouer lres to nue Patrons complayning of their wronges, and yo"
Peticon's free trade being bard And afterward by deteyning of his goods &
the passengers that came home in his shipps as well at the first coming as
afterwards when yo" peticon' had two shipps & 100 men in pay vpon a
second voyage which shipps they desyring to stay that the Magazine
might take away theit Trade before yo" Orato's shipp came to Virginia, the
deteyning his goods being the means to doe it, Yo" Petiéoner findeing him-
self so besett by them that he had noe way to escape them but by putting
himself to the Company thinking that fiue Counsello's & 15 Cofiion’s could
hardly be founde that would doe him so much wrong To his ou?throw he
felt that this conclaue consisting of two buyers and three sellers Alderman
Johnson being the buyer and seller of a great part of yo" Petiéon's goods to
himselfe was the Companye they intended whereby they deceiued yo"
Peticon' to the vallue of 3000", stayed his shipps putting them into a winters
voyage were the death of the most of hismen The Mariners sould his shipps

tleman his ptner had the voyage ouerthrowne w‘h cost as it appears by their
Acc? neer vypon 3600" and this was donn in the name of the Company,
This there vniust dealings much greiuing some of the noblest of thadventu's
who seeking aswell to redress these wrongs as to call 8" Thomas Smyth and
Sor§ his Casheires to aee® for the moneys he [he] hath reéd vppon adven-
tures, lotteryes and other means graunted by the King for the good of the
said Plantaton, But by the sequence it appeares, they traduced him to his
Mat, and ioyning w'h certaine sole importers of tobacco, vnder a Couller
of their being the onely husbands to the King they sought to make them-
selues or some of their frinds Gou9no's thereby to keep the said Plantaton
in slauery, and to smother there iniurious dealings which Gou?norship
although they failed in it the Company not induring them yet the sole
importaéon of tobacco being gained by the Projecto's they haue banished
the bringing home of Virginia tobacco, whereby the Plantaéon is vadonne
by them, that setting a price onely of tobacco and sassefrass made it alone
to be planted there: All wth wrongs & iniuryes afforesaid yo" Petitoner
hath thought fitt to make knowne to this honorable assemblye humbly
desyring that the said 8t Thomas Smyth may declare wherefore he hath
not ruled the Compa & Colony in Virg. according to his Ma" Lres Pattents
& instrucéons, but by +he lawes directly contrary to the same, And fur-
ther that he and his Cash Keps may be forthwith Compelled to pay into
the now Trér so much money as they haue any way re@d for the said Com-
pany, & can shew noe true or iustifiable ace? or discharge for the same, And
likewise to consider how much the Plantaéon hath been dishonored thereby,
And lastly that he and his associates may make satisfacton to yo" Petiéoner
of all such hindrances as he hath by their vniust practizes susteyned

The humble Aunsweare of St Thomas Smyth kn* and Robt Johnson
Alderman vnto the Petiton of John Bargraue exhibited in way of
Complaint to the Honorle Assemblye the knights and Burgesses,
Committees for greiuances of the lower house of Parliam'

In all humble manner Letting pass all vaine & imptinent matter to the
first point materiall that S" Tho Smyth hath framed a Tiranicall gofiment
ymposed vpon the people in Virginia ete

Thomas Smyth sayth that the Comissions giuen by him as Treier &
the vestt} rest of his Ma** Counsell for Virginia vnto 8* Thomas Gates &
other the Goiino™ sent to Virginia were neuer otherwise, but expresslye
to rule and gouerne so neer as might be according to the lawes of England
as by the said Commissions ready to be shewed may appeare: But if any
of these printed lawes and articles to w"" the said Bargraue referreth, may
seem too seueare as vppon paine of death to be obserued (howsoeu? being
rightly weighed they are iustifiable by the lawes of England) yet they
were not framed by 8" Thomas Smyth as most vntrulye aleaged, but by
those worthye Gofino™ in Virginia as the very title & printed preface to
the book itselfe setts downe; w lawes and articles 8° Thomas Smyth
was so farr from frameing or making them as in his letters written to
Captaine Martine, one of the first Plainters, and a speciall man at that
tyme in Virginia, he signifyed his dislike of the strictnes thereof fearing
it would discourage men from gocing to the Plantaéon, yea, all the said
Gotino™, viz the Lord Lawarr and 8" Thomas Dale disceased, as also 5”
Thd Gates & Captaine Argall successiuely, now liueing, and readye to
witnes did see such a necessitye that the said lawes should be made and
published in some cases, ad terrorem, and in some to be truely executed,
as w"out w the Colony consisting then of such debayst & irregular psons
could not possibly continue: And it is a bould slaunder that 5° Thomas
Smyth and others practizeing wt" him did print the said book and practize
522 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

those things for their owne ends, first nothing being donne by him in the
practize & execuéon thereof and secondly the printer yet liueing can witnes
that he was directed to print it not by St Thomas Smyth alone but by
sundry of his Mas Counsell for Virg: whereof many are very hon>!e LL
& kn, now liueing & of this honorte house

And the said S* Thomas Smyth and Alderman Johnson doe joynetly say
that to their knowledge the said Bargraue had noe nominaéon in any
Pattent to make a priuate Plantaéon nor neuer made any, much les the
first as he vntruelye alleageth but they beleiue that wthout Comission
from the Companye he sent thither his Deputies, a very disordered Crew,
that intruded there vppon the Lands of other Planters & Comitted outrage
and rapine vppon the pore Indyans, as Captaine Martine, then in Virginia
now in London vnder the testimony of his hand complayneth & is ready
being called to iustifye. Neither doe the said 8° Thomas Smyth nor
Alderman Johnson beleiue, nor know, nor is it by their meanes that he
hath suffred those supposed daffiages, of one thousand pounds in one
voyage to Virginia, by reason of the 75‘? and other Articles executed
there, but they say confidentlye, that if by Captaine Argall then Goiinor
in Virginia the said Bargraue was hindred in his designes, it was to eisye a
punishment for such to be onely Curbed & restrained of their euill courses
whereof Captaine Argall now resident in London complayneth «& is ready
to iustifie against Bargraues Deputyes & others that vnder Couller of goeing
to trade w'® the Indyans did for their priuate lucre vnfurnish the Colonye
of necessary prouisions and furnish the Indyans wth Armes, or rob them
of their [2] corne, and also to approue that the afforesaid article, restrayning
all men on paine of death without leaue to take & Carry shipps and vessells
out of the Riuer vnder pretence of Tradeing, whereby many played the
Pyratts and took their courses to rob and spoyle, was very iust and
necessarye.

And they vtterly denye, as faleely suggested by the said Bargraue and
most imptinent that euer they ioyned with the sole importees of tobacco
or that they sought to deteyne the gofiment, wth by 8" Thomas Smyth
was absolutely refused, and in open Court denyed to be putt in elecéon,
neither did they bannish the bringing home of Virginia tobacco, that
being donne by those that succeded after he had left the Gotiment, w™
if it be a iust ymputaéon, it resteth vppon them.
NOVEMBER (AFTER 22), 1621 523

And they doe further say and thereof doe humbly desyre this honorable
Comittee to be informed that this Bargraue being at pute 500" ix indebted
by his bond long forfeited to the Virginia Aduenture™ for tobacco bought
of them; This bond was put in sute by S' Thomas Sinyth S* John Wol-
stenholm and Alderman Johnson to whome it was made by order from the
said Aduent® Bargraue remooued the Cause into Chancerye wt? a
rayling bill against those three and others. Now forasmuch as in the
said bill he lyeth downe the staying of his shipp, deteyning of his goods,
Combinaéon of Alderman Johnson and others to defeat him of an other
bargane w'® all the rest material! conteyned in his petiéon to this hono?
Committee, vnder couller of w° vniust complaint he detaines the Cause
in Chancery, and keeps the 500'' in his hands, many witnesses are exam-
ined vppon oath of both sydes the cause being ready for tryall, diuerse
dayes in sundry tearmes haue been appointed but by his moéon and
suggestions putt off, and now a finall day being sett the 10" of this pnte
Nouember 1621 o* Counsell feed and all thyngs ready for hearing the said
Bargraue minding nothing less, eirnestly mooued and obteyned a day in
the next Tearme, vnder couller of further examining a witness already
sworne & examined. Which Course in Chauncery being of his owne
choosing if himself will now deelyne by this his appeale, then they huinblye
pray that he may be inioyned first to dismis his bill in chauncerye and to
pay them such Charges & moneyes as he hath so vniustly detyned and
caused them to spend in following his dilatory course, and they shalbe
willing to submitt themselues in a#¥ any thing that this honorable Comittee
shall think fitting. But if he shall so refuse, then the sayd S' Thomas
Smyth and Alderman Johnson doe further certifie this honor’? Comittee,
that notwthstanding there many yeares paynes for the good of Virginia
their owne disbursm* & great ingagements euen to this day in the greatest
disasters of that PlantaGon many yeares before Bargraues name was
knowne in that worke, as is ready to be witnessed by many against him,
and those, by whome he is animated to this Complaint, & notwithstanding
they neuer wronged the said Bargraue by the least word or deed, yet he
ceaseth not in all places & by all deuises of tongue & pen to pursue them
in such reproachfull tearmes & manner as is intollerable for instance,
charging S* Thomas Smyth w vntrue and uniustifiable accoumpts & his
goverment to be odious, the aecount aping by Audito™ to be 500" indebted
524 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

to him, and not he to it, and his painfull gouerment comended & rewarded
w*? shares of land in a great Court and gefially approoued of all

And Chargeing the sayd Alderman Johnson w* indirect dealing & in plane
tearmes as may be shewed vnder his owne hand w** coosenage, w‘> abuse
of his malitious tongue sounded so lowde and wide as by some means it
came to his Ma"® sacred Eares, for w° his Ma‘’ not long since was pleased
to call the said Alderman Johnson to his presence, relating to him ver-
batim the pticulers, & required his answear in writing, w™ within [3] few
dayes he brought and delified to his Ma‘’® vnder the testimonye of a
generall assemblye of Thadventurers which so fully cleared him in euery
perticuler that his Ma’ pvsing the same & seing him so abused, vppon
his humble peti¢on caused a refference to the now Atturney Gefiall for
the examining the sayd Bargraue and one Melling his associate and to
determine of some Course in Starr Chamber to punish their scandelous
tongues, w°* Course hath been yet forborne with pacience, expecting their
amendment whereof in this Bargraue they see noe hope at all, but still in
open Court, in Paules, in ye streets and in all places without cause, vsing
vile and scandalous speeches and behauio'’ against them

And therefore they pray this honor’'e Comittee to determine some way
for Correcting this course and eising this their greiuance w may be any
mans ease to be so abused if he be suffred wthout punishment.

After o' verie hartie Comendaéons: Our last vnto yo" were by y° Warwick
and Tyger, w departed hence about the midle of September w* a Maga-

we hope are long ere this safely arived w'" yo", we were then so ample in

at psent to enlarge any thing concerning them, further then w" all earnest-
nes to desire yo" serious cares and vttermost endevo™ for the accomplish-
inge of thing in such maner, as they were then recomended vnto yo';
w will not only be here of vs and the Company very gratefully accepted
as a pledge from yo" selues and the Collony, of that mutuall good-will
and respect w** o° affeetéonate loue and zealous care of theire welfare doth
deserue; but vndoubtedlie produce many great matters, highly to the
benefitt and advancement of the Plantation: for what may yo" not expect
that a iust and faire pformance of thing¢ will bring to passe, when the
expectation only and confidence thereof haue done so much, and caused
so many kind¢ of Adventures, one whereof, and one of the principall is,
the trade of Furrs now by the Discouerie to be attempted, and we hope
by gods blessinge shalbe happelie effected, if yo" serious cares and endevo”
be bestowed therevppon: w™ although we nothing doubt of in a matter
of so great hono', and excedinge profitt to the Collony as this is like to
be, and wherevnto we haue so often and earnestly been by them invited:
yett we canot but againe and againe desire yo" to giue all favo" and assist-
ance therevnto, and that in all earnest and effectual maner.

The hope of Silkeworme seed whereof we are yett disapointed, hath kept
the Shipp longer then we meant, and later then phapp¢ were fitt for the
two vioadges she is to be employed: that neither of them therefore may
miscarrie, we pray youe to take order, that she may w'® all expediton
NOVEMBER 26, 1621 §27

proceed on her ffurr vioadge, and not to suffer any time to be lost, either
by default of the Marriners (if they should be negligent) or for want of
such supplies as they are to receiue from yo". the Aduenturo™ of South-
ampton hundred (who out of a noble disposition to forward the bussines,
haue wt great charg und'tooke it thus in theire Shipp) haue very abun-
dantly provided her w*> all thing necessarie; yet if there be any thing
whereby shee may be strengthned or accomodated, we desire yo" to furnish
her therew: and in pticuler that yo" lett them haue the brasse peeces
w were sent in the Charles.

If likewise the Shipp¢ Company shall seeme to weake we desire yo" to
make supplie out of the Collony, of such men as are most fitt, and in
especiall that yo" putt in two or three skilfull in the languages and maners
of the Indians, and expert in those places, wherein the trade is to be,
that may serue for guides and Interpreters.

The Adventurers had purposed to haue sent some quantities of beanes
and pease for trade but the Shipp¢ hould (the ordinarie calamitie of Vir-
ginia vioadges) proues to scant, and they haue beene further informed
that those graines are not so acceptable as the Virginia Mase: wherefore
we desire yo" to furnish them w** such quantities of maze as they shall
need as likewise w'® whatsoeu’ else may be to the furtherance of the
acton: In w what soever psons or good¢ shalbe employed, the Adventurers
are willinge, that a due sattisfation may be made them thereone.

They haue desired vs to send yo" both the Invoyces of theire good¢, and
the Coppie of the Instructons w*" they haue given vnto Cap' Jones;
whereby yo" may pceiue how much they relie vppon yo" Counsell and
assistance, w°® as well for theire owne sakes (that so much deserues) and

carefull and solicitous thereof, that thing¢ may be so contrived w"* tudge-

St: This week, by the help of God, I intend to be w® y": but it wilbe Satur-
day first: for we must make small iournies: my wife beeing the weakest
creature I suppose, that ever took such a iournie, at so unscasonable a
tyme. But such is hir hart, that she will not stay behynd me. At my
coming I shall give all my discreet frends satisfaction, that the cause of
my absence hetherto hath been iust & necessaric. I cannot sufficiently
prize the love of my frends there: who will not forsake me, though frowned
on by so great persons. And I would that to frowne on me were the
woorst they ment me. But God forgive the wrong dooers, & receive them
that are wronged into his protection: w* is my hope. I knowe not what
service I can doo there when I come: but my hart shalbe to doo the best.
But in another matter of service, the treatie between the East Indi litigants,
as the tymes now stand, my mynd giveth me that I could doo som good.
And if other men were of that opinion, I should willingly accept of the
service. Commend me I pray y* to M' Barbor: whose desire I shall
satisfie: Excuse me to M' Melling for not writing in this great haste:

After o' very hartie Comendacons, Wee writt vnto you very lately by the
Discouerie, whereof Capt Thomas Jones went Maister: we haue since
received certaine advice, that there are newly gon from Amsterdam for
the same trade of ffurrs and the self same places, two smale Pinaces, the
one of 40 Tunn w'* foure, and the other of 80 Tunn w* six peeces of cast
Ordinance double manned, and exeedingly well provided wt* Comodities:
wherefore it will very much import that the Discouerie be instantly expe-
dited from Virginia, w those necessarie supplies of men and provisions,
that we haue intreated you to furnish her wt, that she may not com
either to weak or to late, or any way vnfitt for the pformance of her
bussines; for the pticularities whereof we referr yo" to o* former letters,
the topics whereof we here inclosed send yo". Now we only in the most
effectuall and earnest maner that we may againe recomend it to yo"
most serious cares and zealous furtherance. ffor the supplies of the
Magazine and Maide formerly sent in the Marmaduke, Warwick, and
Tyger; we assure o° selues thing@ are in that forwardnes of a good
return (through yo" prudent cares and favo'’) as we haue more cause
to giue yo" hartie thanke, then need to intreat yo" asistance therein:
yett because no diligence in so waightie matters, can be thought supflu-
ous; we haue at the intreatie of the Adventurers, here inclosed sent
yo" the Copie of that dispatche, to reviue thing€ in yo’ memorie,
and thereto do now againe adioyne o* most earnest intreatie for the
continuance of yo" care, and iust fauo', till the full acecomplishinge of
all those businesses in such maner as is desired, and indeed deserved, by
such free and worthie mind@, as those Adventurers moue from. Wee will
not recapitulate, what wee haue amply in o* form® letters expressed, how
iust and necessarie it is (the Companies stock beinge vtterly exhausted
and no meanes of supplie but from private purses) that a good and profit-
able accompt should be returned of these many Adventures; we will
only add (w*" to generous mind@ is of no smale force) that by yo" wise
DECEMBER 6, 1621 531

cares and just favo" it is expected; and in that confidence, but principally
out of a singuler zeale to advance the Plantacon and accomodate the
Planters, although the Adventures alreadie sent, haue been so many and
so large, as o'selues cannot but wonder, yet haue the self same psons
newly vnd'writt nere a thousand pounde for the sending of Shippwrighte
and house-Carpenters; and so farr is the busines alreadie proceeded in, as
we may asure yo", and yo" the Collony, that by God¢ blessing, they shall by
the end of Aprill at the furthest haue this necessarie supplie amongst them:
In the meane space we desire that fitt preparations may be made for the
enterteining of them, that shall after make preparations for others; In
w regard we giue yo" this timely notice: and also that yo" might be
ptakers w'* us of the comfort and encoragment, w we dayly receiue by
the continuance and increase of those free and worthie Adventurers,
wherein we w all thankfull humilitie do acknowledg the gratious provi-
dence of God, in so much enlargeinge (vppon the failinge of the publique
revenues) the heart of private men, in a verie difficult time, and after so
many vnfortunate Adventures made in the like kinde, to pforme these
great work, so advanteageable and necessarie vnto the Plantation.
There is one thinge likewise that hath lately hapned vnto us, not great in
itself but of great good hope; the gentlemen and Mariners of the Royall
James belongeing to the East India Company, being mett at Cap Bona
Speranza by some English Shipps outward bound, and certified of the
prosperitie of Virginia, did there (vppon the exhortation of M’ Copland
theire Minister) bestow the sume of 70" towarde the buildinge of a free
schoole in Virginia; w“ pious guift hath lately received an addiccon of
304 by an vnknowne pson. The maner of employeinge the mony w* the
Company hath resolued vppon, we send yo" here inclosed, desiringe that
yo" would likewise take it into yo" considerations: We likewise send yo"
the Copies of some Court¢, whereby yo" shall vnd'stand, what hath lately
passed cone™ning the bringeing in of all o" Tobbaeco; w% we doubt not but
yo" haue and shall heare of by many waies; otherwise we should haue been
loth to mingle any thing vnpleasant amongst so much ioyfull and comfort-
able as we haue before related; but such is the composition of all worldly
affaires: for o'selues we are not, and desire yo" likewise not to be dis-
coraged, att any difficulties that do or may arise: w*" we interprett onely as
the tryall of ot patience and vertue, whether we be worthie to be the Instru-

ment¢ of so glorious a worke as this Plantation is, so we wish and desire yo"
to conceiue, and to go on cheerefully in yo" waighty charg¢, according to the
instruccons we haue given yo", and in especiall that yo" vse all possible
dilligence and industrious care, to further and accomplish those great and
many designes of Salte, Sawinge Mills, and Iron, not letting slipp those
oecacons, w*? phapps will hardly be ever recovered; nor neglecting the
pfectinge of those thing@ w** yo" haue, and ever shall haue, a certaine
necessitie of, and but an vncertaine asurance of from vs: wee desire yo"
therefore very earnestly to endevo™ the setting vp of those and other
staple Comodities, and by example and by pswations to make the whole
Collony capable, [214] what necessitie lieth vppon them, to make a good
store win themselues, of all vsefull Comodities, rather then a smale
advantage of p'sent profitt. Wee haue by this Shipp and the Discouerie
sent you diu™ sort€ of seed¢, and fruit trees, as also Pidgeons, Connies,
Peacocke Maistiues, and Bechiues, as you shall by the Invoice pceiue;
the preservation & encrease whereof we recomend vnto yo". We haue
sent vnto yo" likewise some Vine cutting¢ and a very smale quantitie of
Silkworm seed, of both wt" we had hoped to haue sent you abundance,
and in that regard deteined the Discoverie so long; but of thing@ so farr
remote we are not absolute maisters, we are put in howerly expectation
thereof, In the mean while, we pray yo" that these now sent, and those
yo" formerly had, may be improved to the most; and the skill of the
Frenchmen diffused amongst many, though they haue not much matter
to exercise it in.

There haue been nyne several Pattent€ granted at o° last Quarter Court,
and aboue 1,000 people vnde'taken to be transported by them this next
Spring, we desire yo" therefore that those due provisions of Guesthouses
(so often sollicited by vs) may be made, and abundance of Corn planted
to supplie them at fittinge prices, in regard that through the great rayse
of grayn here, they are like to come slenderly furnished hence. And
further we commend vnto yor care and charitie the enterteim' of those
p’sent Planters, that at their first landing, they may haue yo" best further-
ance for the lodgeing them in howses; and also in setting out of theire land
in convenient places, together w yo' best assistance and direccon in their
courses, at their first arivall, that they may by yo" curteous vsage be
encoradged to stay wt yo", and others invited to come vnto yo": and
DECEMBER 6, 1621 533

amongst these in pticuler wee cannot but cofiend m* Copeland¢ three
Tennt¢, he having merited that favor of the Company. Wee haue dilli-
gently laboured but not yett able to effect any thinge towardé yo" helpe in
the matter of Fortification: yet are we not out of hope to do something
shortly In the meane while, we desire you not to be any thing remisse,
in whatsoever may tend to yor saftie, to w°* no gaine can be comparable,
but to be alwaies so prepared as in imminent danger, and especially to
supplie w abundance of care and vigilancie, what yo" want in strength.
The coniectures of the Southwest passage and the peece of Copper w™
yo" sent us, wee gladly saw and heard; for since yo" now begin to discover
the Cuntrie, and enquire after Comodities we doubt not, but yo" shall find
what yo" seeke, or better; wherefore we earnestly desire yo", to continue
and proceed herein, according to yo" best meanes; and to send us from
time to time the Carde@ of such places as yo" shall discou'; and larg
quantities of the Comodities that yo" find, for the Sayes of thinge are not
easily nor certainly made in smale quantities: The place of Copper holde
nothing else, but is so pfect good, that if it might be gotten w" so easie
labo" as the Indiané relate, there were no mine could equall the riches
thereof: what further yo" haue vnd'stood thereof, we desire by the next
to heare, that we may both sattisfie o'selues and others, and either begin
or leaue so rich a hope.

The last thing we haue at p'sent to writte, is that these Shippe the Bona Nova
& Hopewell both in 07 owne, and the Companyes name, may be seriously
recomended vnto yo", that they may be speedily dispatched from Virginia,
and neither by yo" deteined, nor suffered themselues to trifle out the time.
In w we especially require the care of m* Pountis, whom in of last Quarter
Court, we haue chosen Vice Admirall, and purpose, God willng, wi the
first opportunitie to estate the place w" twelve Tennt@. Thisor whatsoeu’
favo' or eurtesie yo" can aford vnto these Shippé, in furtherance of theire
intended fishinge vyoadges, wee pray yo" effectually to pforme, for so
both the vnd'takers and setters out of them do deserue at yo™ and o°
hande; and the good or ill successe of this bussines doth very highly
importe the Collony w* we doubt not but yo" fully und'stand: And so

TO THE HON™"™? COMPANIE OF VIRGINIA.

Right Honorable and Worthy:

The fame of our late vnhappy accident in Virginia, hath spread it selfe, I
doubt not, into all parts abroad, and as it is talked of of all men, so no
question of many, and of most, it eannot but be misreported, some carryed
away with ouer-weak lightnesse to beleeue all they heare, how vntrue
soeuer; others out of their disaffection possibly to the Plantation, are
desirous to make that, which is ill, worse; and so the truth of the Action,

1 The copies in the John Carter Brown Library and the Newberry Library contain, folded in,
the broadside “The Inconveniencies that have happened”, ete. (List of Records No. 292; see
p. 577, post.) The New York Public Library has it in separate form.

2 No copy seems to contain this ‘‘Note.” Apparently the broadside “The Inconveniencies,”
etc., was a substitute for it,

which is only one, is varied and misreported. J haue thought it therefore
a part of some acceptable seruice in me towards you, whose fauors haue
preferred me to be a member of your Company, to present you with these
my poore labours, the Collection of the truth hereof, drawne from the
relation of some of those that were beholders of that Tragedie, and who
hardly eseaped from tasting of the same cup, as also from the Letters sent
you by the Gowernour and other Gentlemen of quality, and of the Councell
in that Colonie, read openly here in your Courts: That so the world may
see that it was not the strength of a professed enemy that brought this
slaughter on them, but contriued by the perfidious treachery of a false-
hearted people, that know not God nor faith, No generous Spirit will
forbeare to goe on for this accident that hath hapned to the Plantation,
but proceed rather chearfully in this honorable Enterprize, since the
discouery of their bruitish falshood will proue (as shall appeare by this
Treatise following) many waies aduantageable to vs, and make this
forewarning a forearming for euer to preuent a greater mischiefe.

Accept it from me, I most humbly beseech you, as the first fruits of my
poore seruice. Time may happily make me able to yeeld you some other
worke whose subiect may bee Ioy, as this is a Theame of Sadnesse: Meane-
time, I commit You and the Noble Colony to Gods good blessing, as he
that shall alwaies be

1622 543

Although there haue been many and sundry Treatises writ of Virginia,
and the Commodities thereof; whereat malitious men may take occasion
to cauill, but godly men will finde good cause to praise the Almighty,
whose wonders are seene in the deepe, through the which we haue sailed
to the discouery of this good Land: Yet I haue not thought it aniisse
(since T am to expresse some late Accidents) before-hand to summe vp the
benefits of that Countrey; partly because they daily encrease by new Dis-
coueries made, to the glory of our most gratious King, and euer renowned
to all posteritie, for the founding and supporting of this most Royall and
blessed work of Plantation, to the great honor, wealth [2] and happinesse
of his most famous Kingdomes; and partly, because such is the customary
daintinesse of Readers, that they seldome take the paines to gather together
all that hath beene written of any subiect, that so they might take the whole
businesse into their consideration, (which is the onely way to make a true
iudgement,) but vsually content themselues with one or two Bookes set
out occasionally, and with reference to some former Treatises, whereby
they gaine but a lame and parcell-knowledge, and so oftentimes both
preiudice themselues and the truth.

The Countrey called Vircinta (so named by the late Virgin-Quceene Hliza-
beth of blessed memory) being the rightfull inheritance of his Maiesty, as
being first discouered at the costs and charges of that most prudent Prince
of famous memory, King Henry the Seauenth, his Maiesties great Grand-
father; The Patent whereof still extant to be seene, was granted to John
Cabot and diuers other of his subiects, who went thither with sixe Saile
of Ships, and discouered as farre as from Cape Florida to New-found-land,
all along the Coast, and tooke possession thereof to the Kings vse, about
that time when Ferdinando and Isabella discouered the Westerne Indies:
(by which title of first discouery the King of Portugal and Spaine hold
and enioy their ample and rich Kingdomes in their Jndies Kast & West:)
A coast where King Edward the Sixt after planted his fishing to the New-
found-land by publike Act in Parliament, and of which Philip Amadas
and Arthur Barlow tooke againe possession to the vse of the late Queene
Elizabeth: and after them, [8] Sir Richard Greenfield, Sir Ralph Lane, and
Sir Walter Rawleigh; at what time seuerall Colonics were there placed.
And since his Maiesties most happy comming to the Crowne, being an
544 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

absolute King of three of the most populous Kingdomes (which Charles
the Fift was wont to tearme Officina gentium, the shop or forge of men,)
finding his Subiects to multiply by the blessed peace they enioy vnder
his happy gouernment, did out of his high wisedome and Princely care of
the good of his Subiects, grant a most gratious Patent to diuers Honour-
able persons, and others of his louing Subiects, authorizing them thereby
to goe on in the Plantation of this his lawfull and rightfull Kingdome of
Vircinia, which by the blessing of Almighty God is growne to good
perfection.

This spatious and fruitful Country of Viren, is (as is generally knowne
to all) naturally rich, and exceedingly well watered, very temperate, and
healthfull to the Inhabitants, abounding with as many naturall blessings,
and replenished with as goodly Woods, and those full of Deere and sundry
other beasts for mans sustenance; and the Seas and Riuers thereof (many
therein being exceeding fayre and nauigable) as full of excellent fish of
diuers sorts, and both water & land yeelding as great variety of fowle, as
any Country in the world is knowne to afford. The situation whereof
being neere the middest of the world, betweene the extremities of heate
and colde, seemes to partake of the benefits of both, and therby becometh
capable of the richest commodities of most parts of the Earth. From
whence ariseth an assurance [4] that (by the assistance and skill of industry)
those rich Furres, Cordage, and other Commodities, which with difficulty
and danger are now drawn from Russia, will be had in Vireinta and the
parts adioyning, with ease and safety. And the Masts, Plancks, and
Boards, the Pitch and Tarre, the Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes, the Hempe
and Flaxe, which now are fetched from Nerway, Denmarke, Poland, and
Germany, will there be had in abundance. The Iron, which hath so wasted
our English Woods, (that it selfe in short time must decay together with
them) is to be had in Virarnta (where wasting of Woods is an ease and
benefit to the Planter) for all good conditions answerable to the best Iron
of the world, whereof proofe hath beene made. The Wines, Fruits, and
Salt of France and Spaine: the Silkes of Persia and Italy, will be had also
in Virarnr4, in no kinde of worth inferiour, where are whole Woods of
many miles together of Mulberry trees of the best kindes, the proper food
of the Silke-worme, and a multitude of other naturall commodities. Of
Woods, Roots and Berries, for excellent Dyes; of Plants and other Drugs
1622 545

for Physicall seruice; of sweet Woods, Oyles and Gummes, for pleasure
and other vse; of Cotton-wooll, Silke-grasse and Sugar-Canes, will there
be had in abundance, with many other kindes. And for Corne, Cattell,
and Fish, (which are the substance of the food of man) in no place better:
the Graine also of our owne Country prospering there very well; but their
Maize (being the naturall Graine of Virarnia) doth farre exceed in pleasant-
nesse, strength, fertilitie, and generalitie of vse, the Wheat of England.

{5} The Cattell which were transported thither (being now growne neere to
fifteene hundred) doc become much bigger of body then the breed from
whence they came. The Horses also (through the benefit of the Climate,
and nature of their feeding) more beautifull and fuller of courage. And
such is the extraordinary fertilitie of that soyle, that the Does of their Deere
(a kinde differing from ours in England, yet no way inferiour) yeeld two
Fawnes at a fall or birth, and sometimes three. And the Fishings along
our Coasts are in plenty of Fish equall to those of New-found-land, and in
greatnesse and goodnesse much superiour, and twice in the yeare to be
taken, in their going and returne, which is not else-where found in such
plenty and varietie; So as there went this yeare from diuers parts of this
Kingdome, neere thirty Saile thither, who are well returned and richly
fished.

To conclude (but out of certaine aduertisements so often reiterated from
thence, as well as by the constant relations of many hundreds now yearely
comming & going) they auow, that it is a Country which nothing but igno-
rance can thinke ill of, and which no man but of a corrupt minde & ill
purpose can defame, which as it paralelleth the most opulent and rich
Kingdomes of the world, by lying in the same Latitude with them, so doth
it promise richer Mynes of the best and most desired mettals with them,
when the Colonie shall be of sufficient strength to open and defend them.
And for the Passage thither, and Trade there, it is free from all restraint by
forren Princes, whereunto most of our other accustomed trades are subiect:
there is neyther danger in the way, through [6] the encountring of the Enemy
or Pyrate, nor meeting with Rockes or Sholes (by reason of the fayre and
safe passage thorow the maine Ocean) nor tediousnes of tourney, which by
reason of better knowledge then in former yeares (the fruit of time and
obseruation) is oftner made and in fewer weekes, then formerly it was wont

to be in moneths; which (with the blessing of God) produced in the last
Summer this effect, that in the Fleet of nine Saile of ships, transporting
aboue seauen hundred Passengers out of England and Ireland, for the
Plantation, but one person (in whose roome another at Sea was borne)
misearryed by the way. And for them after ariuall, there are conuenient
lodgings now in building, and carefull attendance in Guests-houses
prouiding, till those that ariue can prouide for themselues.

In the three last yeares of 1619. 1620. and 1621. there hath beene prouided
and sent for VIRGINIA forty two Saile of ships, three thousand fiue hundred
and seauenty men and women for Plantation, with requisite prouisions,
besides store of Cattell, and in those ships haue beene aboue twelue hundred
Mariners imployed: There hath also beene sent in those yeares nine ships
to the Sommer Hands with about nine hundred people to inhabite there, in
which ships two hundred and forty Mariners were imployed. In which
space haue beene granted fifty Patents to particular persons, for Plantation
in VIRGINIA, who with their Associates haue vndertaken therein to trans-
port great multitudes of people and cattell thither, which for the most part
is since performed, and the residue now in preparing, as by the seuerall
Declarations of [7] each yeare in their particulars, (manifested and approued
in our generall and publike Quarter-Courts) and for the fuller satisfaction
of all desirous to vnderstand the particularities of such proceedings, hath
beene by printing commended to the vnderstanding of all.

The Letters written from the Gouernor and Treasurer in VIRGINIA in the
beginning of March last, (which came hither in April,) gaue assurance of
ouercomming and bringing to perfection in this yeare, the Iron-works,
Glasse-works, Salt-works, the plentifull sowing of all sorts of English graine
with the Plough, hauing now cleared good quantitie of ground; setting of
store of Indian Corne or Maize, sufficient for our selues, and for trueke with
the Natiues; restraint of the quantity of Tobacco, and amendment. of it in
the quality, learned by time and experience; The planting of Vines and
Mulberry-trees neere to their houses, Figg-trees, Pomgranats, Potatoes,
and Cotton-wooll seedes,‘ Pocoon, Indico, Sugar-Canes, Madder, Woade,
Hempe, Flaxe, and Silke-grasse; and for the erecting of a fayre Inne in
lIames-Citie for the better entertainment of new commers, whereto and to
other publike workes, euery old planter there offered freely and liberally

to contribute. I write the words of their Letters. And how in a late
Discouery made, a few moneths before by some of them to the South-
ward, they had past thorow great Forrests of Pines, fifteene or sixteene
miles broad, and aboue threescore miles long, very fit for Mastes for ship-
ping, and for Pitch and Tarre, and of other sorts of woods fit for Pot-ashes
and Sope-ashes, and came vnto a most fruitfull Country, blessed with abun-
dance of Corne, [8] reaped twice ayere (within the limits of VIRGINIA)
where also they vnderstand of a Copper-myne, an essay whereof was sent,
and vpon tryall here found to be very rich; and met with a great deale of
Silk-grasse there growing, which monethly may be cut, of which kindes, and Mt Heri! in hin
Cotton-wooll, all the Cambaya and Bengala stuffes are made in the Kast- ae a
Indies: and of which kindes of Silke-grasse was heretofore made a pevce of
Grogeram giuen to Queene Elizabeth. And how that in December last they
had planted and cultiuated in VIRGINIA Vines of all sorts, (as well those
naturally growing, as those other Plants sent them from these parts of
Europe) Orenge and Lemon-trees, Figge-trees, Sugar-Canes, Cotion-
wooll, Cassaui Rootes, (that make very good bread) Plantanes, Potatoes,
and sundry other /ndian fruits and plants not formerly seenein VIRGINIA,
which at the time of their said Letters beganne to prosper very well: as
also their Indico-seedes, for the true cure whereof there is lately caused a
Treatise to be written.

Furthermore, they write that in a Voyage made by Lieutenant Marmaduke
Parkinson, and other English Gentlemen, vp the Riuer of Patomack they
saw a China Boxe at one of the Kings houses where they were: Being
demanded where he had it, made answer, That it was sent him from a
King that dwelt in the West, ouer the great Hils, some tenne dayes iourney,
whose Countrey is neare a great Sea, hee hauing that Boxe, from a people
as he said, that came thither in ships, that weare cloaths, crooked swords,
& somwhat like our men, dwelt in houses, and were called Acanack-China:
and he offered our people, that he would send [9] his Brother along with
them to that King, which offer the Gouernor purposed not to refuse; and the
rather, by reason of the continual constant relations of all those Sauages
in VIRGINIA, of a Sea, and the way to it West, they affirming that the
heads of all those seauen goodly Rivers, (the least wherof is greater then
the Riuer of Thames, and nauigable aboue an hundred and fifty miles,
and not aboue sixe or eight miles one from another) which fall all into one
548 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

great Bay, haue their rising out of a ridge of hils, that runnes all along
South and North: whereby they doubt not but to finde a safe, easie, and
good passage to the South Sea, part by water, and part by land, esteem-
ing it not aboue an hundred and fifty miles from the head of the Falls,
where wee are now planted; the Discouery whereof will bring forth a most
rich trade to Cathay, China, Iapan, and those other of the Hast Indies,
to the inestimable benefit of this Kingdome.

But for the further proofe hereof, and of the North-west passage thither
by Sea, I referre the Reader to the Treatie annexed at the end of this
Booke, written by that learned and famous Mathematician, M' Henry
Briggs, which I hauing happily attained vnto, haue published for the
common good.

Moreouer, the Letters of Mr. John Berkley, sometimes of Beuerstone
Castle in the County of Glocester, (a Gentleman of an honorable Familie)
likewise certifie, that a more fit place for Iron-workes (whereof he was made
Master & ouer-seer) then in VIRGINIA, both for wood, water, mynes, and
stone, was not to be found: And that by Whatsontede then next (now past)
the Company might relye vpon good quantities [10] of Iron made by him:
which also by Letters from Mr. George Sandis the third of March last, was
confirmed, with this farther description of the place (called The falling
Creeke) to be so fitting for that purpose, as if Nature had applyed her selfe
to the wish and direction of the Workeman; where also were great stones
hardly seene else where in VIRGINIA, lying on the place, as though they
had beene brought thither to aduance the erection of those Workes.

The Letters of the French Vignerous or Vine-men, procured out of France
& sent ouer into VIRGINIA, did likewise assertaine, that no Countrey in
the world was more proper for Vines, Silke, Rice, Oliues, and other Fruits,
then VIRGINIA is: and that it farre excelled their owne Countrey of
Languedocke; the Vines of diuers sorts being in abundance naturally ouer
all the Countrey: and they hauing planted some cuttings of Vines at
Michaelmas last, in their Letters affrme that these bare Grapes already
this Spring, to their great wonder, as being a thing they suppose not heard
of in any other Countrey. <A taste of Wine made of the wilde grape, they
last year sent, with hope to send a good quantitie this next Vintage; and
that the Mulberry-trees where they abode were in wonderfull abundance,
1622 549

and much excelling both in goodnesse and greatnesse those of their owne
Country of Languedocke: and that those Silke-wormes they haue, prosper
exceeding well, and some Silke they hope to send this yeare, there wanting
nothing to set vp that rich Commodity but store of hands wherewith
England doth abound. Of the fruit of which Mulberry-trees (as of a Plum
there plentifully grow[11]ing) they would make wholsome drinkes for the
Colony and people there.

The Letters of M' Porey (verified also from the Gouernor and Councell)
aduertised of a late Discouery by him and others made into the great Bay
Northward, (reseruing the sounding of the bottome thereof for a second
Voyage,) where hee left setled very happily neare an hundred English,
with hope of a good trade for Furres there to be had. From thence was
brought by Lieutenant Perkinson, in his voyage, some of that kind of
Earth which is called Yerra Lemnia (there to be had in great abundance)
as good as that of Turkey.

By this (though it be but in part) the Reader may vnderstand the great
riches and blessings of this excellent Countrey, which euen ordinary
diligence and care must needes strangely improue. But that all men may
see the vnpartiall ingenuity of this Discourse, we freely confesse, that the
Countrey is not so good, as the Natiues are bad, whose barbarous Saua-
genesse needs more cultivation then the ground it selfe, being more ouer-
spread with inciuilitie and treachery, then that with Bryers. For the land
being tilled and vsed well by vs, deceiued not our expectation, but rather
exceeded it farre, being so thankfull as to returne an hundred for one. But
the Sauages though neuer Nation vsed so kindly vpon so small desert,
haue in stead of that Haruest which our paines merited, returned nothing
but Bryers and thornes, pricking euen to death many of their Benefactors:
yet doubt wee not, but that as all wickednes is crafty to vndoe it self,
so these also, thorow our sides, haue more wounded [12] themselues then
vs, God Almighty making way for seueritie there, where a fayre gentlenesse
would not take place. The occasion whereof thus I relate from thence.

The last May there came Letters from Sir Francis Wiat Gouernor in
VIRGINIA, which did aduertise that when in Nouember last he ariued
in VIRGINIA, and entred vpon his Gouernment, he found the Country
setled in a peace (as all men there thought) sure and vnuiolable, not onely
550 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

because it was solemnly ratified and sworne, and at the request of the
Natiue King stamped in Brasse, and fixed to one of his Oakes of note, but
as being aduantagious to both parts; to the Sauages as the weaker, vnder
which they were safely sheltred and defended; to vs, as being the easiest
way then thought to pursue and aduance our proiects of buildings, plant-
ings, and effecting their conuersion by peaceable and fayre meanes. And
such was the conceit of firme peace and amitie, as that there was seldome
or neuer a sword worne, and a Peece seldomer, except for a Deere or Fowle.
By which assurance of securitie, the Plantations of particular Aduenturers
and Planters were placed scatteringly and straglingly as a choyce veyne
of rich ground inuited them, and the further from neighbors held the
better. The houses generally set open to the Sauages, who were alwaies
friendly entertained at the tables of the English, and commonly lodged in
their bed-chambers. The old planters (as they thought now come to
reape the benefit of their long trauels) placed with wonderfull content vpon
their priuate diuidents, and the planting [13] of particular Hundreds and
Colonies pursued with an hopefull alacrity, all our projects (saith he) in a
faire way, and their familarity with the Natiues, seeming to open a faire
gate for their conuersion to Christianitie.

The Country being in this estate, an occasion was ministred of sending
to Opachankano the King of these Sauages, about the middle of March last,
what time the Messenger returned backe with these words from him, That
he held the peace concluded so firme, as the Skie should sooner fall then it
dissolue: yea, such was the treacherous dissimulation of that people who
then had contriued our destruction, that euen two dayes before the Mas-
saere, some of our men were guided thorow the woods by them in safety:
and one Browne, who then to learne the language liued among the Warra-
scoyacks (a Prouince of that King) was in friendly manner sent backe by
them to Captaine Hamor his Master, and many the like passages, rather
increasing our former confidence, then any wise in the world ministring
the least suspition of the breach of the peace, or of what instantly ensued;
yea, they borrowed our owne Boates to conuey themselues crosse the
Riuer (on the bankes of both sides whereof all our Plantations were) to
consult of the diuellish murder that ensued, and of our vtter extirpation,
which God of his mercy (by the meanes of some of themselues conuerted to
Christianitie) preuented; and as well on the Friday morning (the fatal
1622 551

day) the 22 of March, as also in the euening, as in other dayes before, they
came vnarmed into our houses, without Bowes or arrowes, or other weap-
ons, with Deere, Turkies, Fish, [14] Furres, and other prouisions, to sell,
and trucke with vs, for glasse, beades, and other trifles: yea in some places,
sate downe at Breakfast with our people at their tables, whom immediately
with their owne tooles and weapons, eyther laid downe, or standing in their
houses, they basely and barbarously murthered, not sparing eyther age or
sexe, man, woman or childe; so sodaine in their eruell execution, that few
or none discerned the weapon or blow that brought them to destruction.
In which manner they also slew many of our people then at their seuerall
workes and husbandries in the fields, and without their houses, some in
planting Corne and Tobacco, some in gardening, some in making Bricke,
building, sawing, and other kindes of husbandry, they well knowing in
what places and quarters each of our men were, in regard of their daily
familiarity, and resort to vs for trading and other negotiations, which the
more willingly was by vs continued and cherished for the desire we had of
effecting that great master-peece of workes, their conuersion. And by
this meanes that fatall Friday morning, there fell vnder the bloudy and
barbarous hands of that perfidious and inhumane people, contrary to all
lawes of God and men, of Nature & Nations, three hundred forty seuen
men, women, and children, most by their owne weapons; and not being
content with taking away life alone, they fell after againe vpon the dead,
making as well as they could, a fresh murder, defacing, dragging, and
mangling the dead carkasses into many pieces, and carrying some parts
away in derision, with base and bruitish triumph.

Neither yet did these beasts spare those amongst [15] the rest well knowne
votthem, from whom they had daily recetued many benefits and fauours,
but spitefully also massacred them, without remorse or pitty, being in this
more fell then Lyons and Dragons, which (as Histories record) haue beene so
farre from hurting, as they haue both acknowledged, and gratefully requited
their Benefactors; such is the force of good deeds, though done to cruell
beasts, as to make them put off the very nature of beasts, and to put on
humanity vpon them. But these miscreants, contrariwise in this kinde,
put not off onely all humanity, but put on a worse and more then vnnaturall
bruitishnesse. One instance of it, amongst too many, shall serue for all.
552 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

That worthy religious Gentleman, Master George Thorpe Esquire,
Deputie of the Colledge lands, sometimes one of his Maiesties Pentioners,
and in one of the principall places of command in VIRGINIA, did so truly
and earnestly affect their conuersion, and was so tender ouer them, that
whosoeuer vnder his authority had giuen them but the least displeasure or
discontent, he punished them seuerely. He thought nothing too deare for
them, and as being desirous to binde them vnto him by his many courtesies,
hee neuer denyed them any thing that they asked him, insomuch that when
these Savages complained vnto him of the fiercenesse of our Mastiues, most
implacable and terrible vnto them, (knowing them by instinct it seemes, to
be but treacherous and false-hearted friends to vs, better then our selues)
he to gratifie them in all things, for the winning of them by degrees, caused
some of them to be killed in their presence, to the great dis[16]pleasure of the
owners, and would haue had all the rest guelt (had he not beene hindered)
to make them the gentler and the milder to them. Hee was not onely too
kinde and beneficiall to the common sort, but also to their King, to whom
hee oft resorted, and gaue many presents which hee knew to be highly
pleasing to him, And whereas this king before dwelt onely in a cottage,
or rather a denne or hog-stye, made with a few poles and stickes, and
couered with mats after their wyld manner, to ciuilize him, he first, built him
a fayre house according to the English fashion, in which hee tooke such
ioy, especially in his locke and key, which hee so admired, as locking and
vnlocking his doore an hundred times aday, hee thought no deuice in all
the world was comparable to it.

Thus insinuating himselfe to this King for his religious purposes, he con-
ferred after with him oft, and intimated to him matters of our Religion;
and thus far the Pagan confessed, moued by naturall Principles, that our
God was a good God, and better much then theirs, in that he had with so
many good things aboue them endowed vs. Hee told him, if hee would
serue our God, hee should bee partaker of all those good things wee had,
and of farre greater then sense or reason euer could imagine. Hee wonne
vpon him, as hee thought in many things, so as hee gaue him fayre hearing
and good answer, and seemed to be much pleased with his discourse and in
his company. And both hee and his people for the daily courtesies this
good Gentleman did to one or other of them, did professe such outward
loue and respect vnto him, as nothing could seeme more: but all was little
1622 553

regarded after by [17] this Viperous brood, as the sequell shewed: for they not,
only wilfully murdered him, but cruelly and felly, out of deuillish malice,
did so many barbarous despights and foule scornes after to his dead corpes,
as are vnbefitting to be heard by any ciuill eare. One thing I cannot omit,
that when this good Gentleman vpon his fatall hower, was warned by his
man (who perceiued some treachery intended to them by these hell-
hounds) to looke to himselfe, and withall ranne away for feare of the
mischiefe he strongly apprehended, and so saued his owne life; yet his
Master, out of the conscience of his owne good meaning, and faire deserts
euer towards them, was so void of all suspition, and so full of confidence,
that they had sooner killed him, then hee could or would beleeue they
meant any ill against him. Thus the sinnes of these wicked Infidels, haue
made them vnworthy of enioying him, and the eternall good that he most
zealously alwayes intended to them.

And thus these miserable wretches, not hee, hath lost by it, who to the
comfort of vs all, hath gayned a Crowne of endlesse blisse, and is assuredly
become a glorious Martyr, in which thrice-happy and blessed state we
leaue him. But these miscreants, who haue thus despised Gods great
mercies so freely offered to them, must needs in time therefore be cor-
rected by his iustice: So as those who by the way of mercies would not
be drawne vnto him, shall some of them at length (no doubt) be brought
vnto him by his way of iudgements: to which leauing them, I will knit
againe together now the thred of my Discourse, and proceed to tell you, That
at the time of this Massacre [18] there were three or foure of our ships in
Tames-Riuer, and one in the next Riuer, and daily more to come in, as
three did within fourteene dayes after; one of which they endeuored to
haue surprised, but in vaine, as had also beene their whole attempt, had
any the least fore-knowledge beene in those places where the Massacre
was committed: yet were the hearts of the English euer stupid, and
auerted from beleeuing any thing that might weaken their hopes of speedy
winning the Sauages to Ciuilitie and Religion, by kinde vsage and fayre
conuersing amongst them. Hee, and the whole Councell write further,
That Almighty God (they doubt not) hath his great worke to doe in this
Tragedy, and will thereout draw honor and glory to his great Name;
safety, and a more flourishing estate to themselues, and the whole Planta-
tion there; and the more speedy conuersion of the Children of those Sauages
554 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

to himselfe, since hee so miraculously preserued so many of the English
(there being, God be praysed, about eleuen parts of twelue still remayning)
whose desire to draw those people to Religion by the carelesse neglect of
their owne safeties, seemes to haue beene the greatest cause of their own
ensuing destruction. Yet it pleased God to vse some of them as instru-
ments to saue many of their liues, whose soules they had formerly saued,
as at Iames-Citie, and other places, and the Pinnace trading in Pamounkey
Riuer, all whose liues were saued by a conuerted Indian, disclosing the
plot in the instant (whereof though our sinnes (say they) made vs vnworthy
to be instruments of so glorious a conuersion in generall, yet his infinite
wisedome can neuerthelesse bring it to passe [19] with some more of them,
and with other Prouinces there in his good time, and by such meanes as
wee thinke most vnlikely. For euen in the deliuery of vs that now suruiue,
no mans particular carefulnesse saued any one person, but the meere
goodnesse of himselfe, freely and miraculously preserued whom it pleased
him.

The Letters of Mr. George Sandis a worthy Gentleman and Treasurer
there, likewise haue aduertised (as many others from many particular
persons of note and worth) besides the Relations of many returned in the
Sea-flower (the ship that brought vs this vnweleome newes) haue beene
heard at large in the publike Courts, that whilst all their affayres were
full of suecesse, and such intercourse of familiaritie, as if the Indians and
themselues had beene of one Nation, those treacherous Natiues, after fiue
yeares peace, by a generall combination in one day plotted to subuert
their whole Colony, and at one instant of time, though our seuerall Plan-
tations were an hundred and forty miles vp one Riuer on both sides.

But before I goe any further, for the better vnderstanding of all things,
you shall know that these wyld naked Natiues liue not in great numbers
together, but dispersed, and in small companies; and where most together,
not aboue two hundred, and that very rare, in other places fifty or forty,
or thereabouts, and many miles distant from one another, in such places
among the Woods where they either found, or might easiliest make some
cleared plots of ground, which they imploy wholly in setting of Corne,
whereby to sustaine their liues. These small and scattered Companies
(as [20] I haue said) had warning giuen from one another in all their habita-
tions to meete at the day and houre appointed for our destruction, at all
1622 555

our seuerall Townes and places seated vpon the Riuer; some were directed
to goe to one place, some to another, all to be done at the same day and
time, which they did accordingly: some entring their Houses vnder colour
of trucking, and so taking aduantage, others drawing our men abroad
vpon faire pretences, and the rest suddenly falling vpon those that were
at their labours.

They certifie further, that besides Master George Thorpe, before mentioned,
Master John Berkeley, Captaine Nathanael Powel, and his wife, (daughter
of Master Wiliam Tracy, and great with childe) and Captaine Maycock,
all Gentlemen of birth, vertue, and industry, and of the Councell there,
suffered ynder this their cruelty and treason.

That the slaughter had beene vniuersall, if God had not put it into the
heart of an Indian belonging to one Perry, to disclose it, who liuing in the
house of one Pace, was vrged by another Indian his Brother (who came
the night before and lay with him) to kill Pace, (so commanded by their
King as he declared) as hee would kill Perry: telling further that by such
an houre in the morning a number would come from diuers places to
finish the Execution, who failed not at the time: Perries Indian rose out
of his bed and reueales it to Paee, that vsed him as a Sonne: And thus
the rest of the Colony that had warning giuen them, by this meanes was
saued. Such was (God bee thanked for it) the good fruit of an Infidell
conuerted to Christianity; for though three hundred and more of ours [21]
died by many of these Pagan Infidels, yet thousands of ours were saued by
the means of one of them alone which was made a Christian; Blessed be
God for euer, whose merey endureth for euer; Blessed bee God whose
mercy is aboue his iustice, and farre aboue all his workes: who wrought
this deliuerance whereby their soules escaped euen as a Bird out of the
snare of the Fowler.

Pace ypon this discouery, securing his house, before day rowed ouer the
Riuer to James-City (in that place neere three miles in bredth) and gaue
notice thereof to the Gouernor, by which meanes they were prevented there,
and at such other Plantations as was possible for a timely intelligence to
be giuen; for where they saw vs standing vpon our Guard, at the sight of
a Peece they all ranne away. In other places that could haue no notice,
some Peeces with munition (the vse whereof they know not) were there
556 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

carried away, and some few Cattell also were destroyed by them. And
as Fame diuulgeth (not without probable grounds) their King hath since
caused the most part of the Gunpowder by him surprized, to bee sowne,
to draw therefrom the like increase, as of his Maize or Corne, in Haruest
next. And that it is since discouered, that the last Summer Opachankano
practised with a King of the Eastern shore (no well-willer of his) to furnish
him with store of poison (naturally growing in his country) for our destruc-
tion, whieh he absolutely refused, though he sent him great store of Beades,
and other presents to winne him thereunto: which he, with fiue or sixe of
his great men, offered to be ready to iustifie against him. That the true
cause [22] of this surprize was most by the instigation of the Deuill, (enemy
to their saluation) and the dayly feare that possest them, that in time we
by our growing continually vpon them, would dispossesse them of this
Country, as they had beene formerly of the West Indies by the Spaniard;
produced this bloody act. That neuer griefe and shame possessed any
people more then themselues, to be thus butchered by so naked and
cowardly a people, who dare not stand the presentment of a staffe in manner
of a Peece, nor an vncharged Peece in the hands of a woman, from which
they flye as so many Hares; much faster then from their tormenting
Deuill, whom they worship for feare, though they acknowledge they loue
him not.

Thus haue you seene the particulars of this massacre, out of Letters from
thence written, wherein treachery and cruelty haue done their worst to vs,
or rather to themselues; for whose vnderstanding is so shallow, as not to
pereeiue that this must needs bee for the good of the Plantation after,
and the losse of this blood to make the body more healthfull, as by these
reasons may be manifest.

First, Because betraying of innocency neuer rests vnpunished: And there-
fore Agesilaus, when his enemies (vpon whose oath of being faithfull hee
rested) had deceiued him, he sent them thankes, for that by their periury,
they had made God his friend, and their enemy.

Secondly, Because our hands which before were tied with gentlenesse and
faire vsage, are now set at liberty by the treacherous violence of the Sausages,
[23] not vntying the Knot, but cutting it: So that we, who hitherto haue
1622 557

had possession of no more ground then their waste, and our purchase at a
valuable consideration to their owne contentment, gained; may now by
right of Warre, and law of Nations, inuade the Country, and destroy
them who sought to destroy vs: whereby wee shall enioy their cultiuated
places, turning the laborious Mattocke into the victorious Sword (whercin
there is more both ease, benefit, and glory) and possessing the fruits of
others labours. Now their cleared grounds in all their villages (which
are situate in the fruitfullest places of the land) shall be inhabited by vs,
whereas heretofore the grubbing of woods was the greatest labour.

Thirdly, Because those commodities which the Indians enioyed as much
or rather more than we, shall now also be entirely possessed by vs. The
Deere and other beasts will be in safety, and infinitly inerease, which
heretofore not onely in the general) huntings of the King (whereat foure or
fiue hundred Deere were vsually slaine) but by each particular Indian
were destroied at all times of the yeare, without any difference of Male,
Damme, or Young. The like may be said of our owne Swine and Goats,
whereof they haue vsed to kill eight in tenne more than the English haue
done. There will be also a great increase of wild Turkies, and other
waighty Fowle, for the Indians neuer put difference of destroying the Hen,
but kill them whether in season or not, whether in breeding time, or sitting
on their egges, or hauing new hatched, it is all one to them: whereby, as also
by the orderly vsing of their fishing Weares, no knowne Country in [24]
the world will so plentifully abound in victuall.

Fourthly, Because the way of conquering them is much more easie then
of ciuilizing them by faire meanes, for they are a rude, barbarous, and
naked people, scattered in small companies, which are helps to Victorie,
but hinderances to Ciuilitie: Besides that, a conquest may be of many,
and at once; but ciuility is in particular, and slow, the effect of long time,
and great industry. Moreouer, victorie of them may bee gained many
waies; by force, by surprize, by famine in burning their Corne, by destroy-
ing and burning their Boats, Canoes, and Houses, by breaking their
fishing Weares, by assailing them in their huntings, whereby they get the
greatest part of their sustenance in Winter, by pursuing and chasing them
with our horses, and blood-Hounds to draw after them, and Mastiues to
teare them, which take this naked, tanned, deformed Sauages, for no other
12892387
558 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

then wild beasts, and are so fierce and fell vpon them, that they feare them
worse then their old Deuill which they worship, supposing them to be a
new and worse kinde of Deuils then their owne. By these and sundry
other wayes, as by driuing them (when they flye) vpon their enemies,
who are round about them, and by animating and abetting their enemies
against them, may their ruine or subiection be soone effected.

So the Spaniard made great vse for his owne turne of the quarrels and
enmities that were amongst the Indians, as throughly vnderstanding and
following that Maxime of the Politician, Diude & impera, Make diuisions
and take Kingdomes: For thus he got two of the greatest Kingdomes of
the West Indies, Peru and [25] Mexico, by the Princes diuisions, and the peo-
ples differences. After the death of Guainacapa king of Peru, his sonnes
Attabalippa and Gascar falling to war about the kingdom, & each of thé
striuing to make the Spaniard to his friend, Francis Pizzarro managing
those their diuisions onely to his owne ends, easily stripped them both of
that rich Kingdome, and became Master of Peru. And so likwise Ferdz-
nando Cortez vanquished King Motezuma, and gained the Kingdome of
Mexico from him, by the aid and furtherance of the neighboring people
of the Prouince of T'ascala, being deadly enemies to the Mexicans; for
which seruice they of Tascala are freed by the Spaniards from all Tributes
to this time. In VIRGINIA the many diuers Princes and people there are
at this day opposite in infinite factions one vnto another, and many of
them beare a mortal! hatred to these our barbarous Sauages, that haue
beene likely as false and perfidious heretofore to them, as vnto vs of late.
So as the quarrels, and the causes of them, and the different humours of
these people being well vnderstood, it will be an easie matter to ouerthrow
those that now are, or may bee our enemies hereafter, by ayding and
setting on their enemies against them. And by these factions and differ-
ences of petty Princes, the Romans tooke their greatest aduantage to
ouercome this Iland of Great Britayne, of which Tacitus sayes, Ita dum
singuli pugnant vniuerst vincuntur. And Justin hath the like saying of
the cause of vanquishing the Grecian Cities.

Fiftly, Because the Jndians, who before were vsed as friends, may now
most iustly be compelled to seruitude and drudgery, and supply the roome
of men [26] that labour, whereby euen the meanest of the Plantation may
imploy themselues more entirely in their Arts and Oecupations, which
1622 559

are more generous, whilest Sauages performe their inferiour workes of
digging in mynes, and the like, of whom also some may be sent for the
seruice of the Sommer Ilands.

Sixtly, This will for ever hereafter make vs more cautelous and circum-
spect, as neuer to bee deceiued more by any other treacheries, but will
serue for a great instruction to all posteritie there, to teach them that
Trust is the mother of Decetpt, and to learne them that of the Italian, Chi
non fida, non s'ingamuu, Hee that trusts not is not deceiued: and make
them know that kindnesses are misspent vpon rude natures, so long as
they continue rude; as also, that Sauages and Pagans are aboue all other
for matter of Iustice euer to be suspected. Thus vpon this Anvile shall
wee now beate out to our selues an armour of proofe, which shall for euer
after defend vs from barbarous Incursions, and from greater dangers that
otherwise might happen. And so we may truly say according to the
French Prouerb, Aquelg; chose malheur est bon, Ill lucke is good for
something.

Lastly, We haue this benefit more to our comfort, because all good men
doe now take much more care of vs then before, since the fault is on their
sides, not on ours, who haue vsed so fayre a cariage, euen to our owne
destruction. Especially his Mazesttes most gratious, tender and paternall
care is manifest herein, who by his Royall bounty and goodnesse, hath
continued his many fauors vnto vs, with a new, large, & Princely supply
of Munition and Armes, out of his Maiesties [27] owne store in the Tower,
being gratiously bestowed for the safety and aduancement of the Planta-
tion. As also his Royall fauor is amply extended in a large supply of men
and other necessaries throughout the whole Kingdome, which are very
shortly to bee sent to VIRGINIA.

Neyther must wee omit the Honourable City of London, who to shew their
zeale at this time (as they haue alwayes done vpon all Honourable occasions
to their endlesse praise) are now setting forth one hundred persons, at their
owne charges, for the aduancement of the Plantations. In the furtherance
of which action, as the whole graue Senate of Aldermen haue shewed much
piety and wisedome, so in particular, the Right Honourable Sir Edward
Barkham Knight, the now Lord Mayor, hath demonstrated a most worthy
560 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

mind. Besides many worthy Persons of birth and quality, and divers
others at their owne costs are now preparing for VIRGINIA. Neyther is
any man to be deiected because of some such disasters as these that may
seeme to thwart the businesse.

What growing State was there euer in the world which had not the like?
Rome grew by opposition, and rose vpon the backe of her enemies. Marke
but the Spaniard who is in the same Continent with VIRGINIA, and hath
now perfected his worke; Marke and tell mee, if hee hath not had more
counterbuffes farre then wee, as out of their owne histories at large may
be proued.

Columbus vpon his returne from the West Indies into Spaine, hauing left
his people with the Indian in peace, and promise of fayre vsage towards
them, yet [28] at his comming backe againe, hee found no one man aliue of
them, but all by the Natiues treacherously slaine.

After this againe, when the Spanish Colony was increased in great numbers,
the Indians (from whom the Spaniards for trucking stuffe vsed to haue all
their corn) generally conspired together to plant no corne at all, intending
therby to famish them, themselues liuing in the meane time vpon Cassaut
(a root to make bread) onely then knowne to themselues: This plot of theirs
by the Spaniards ouer-sight (that foolishly depended vpon Strangers for
their bread) tooke such effect, and brought them to such misery by the
rage of famine, that they spared no vncleane, no loathsome beast, no not
the poysonous and hideous Serpents, but eate them vp also, deuouring one
death to saue them from another: And by this meanes the whole Colony
well-neare surfetted, sickned, and dyed miserably.

After againe, vpon fresh and great supplyes new made, an infinite company
of them by their incontinency dyed of the Indian disease, that hath now
got a French name, which at first (as being a strange and vnknowne
malady) was deadly vpon whomsoeuer it lighted. Besides (before they
knew the cause and remedy) very many lost diuers parts of their body,
feet and hands principally, by a little vermine lesse then a Flea, and
skipping like it, called Nigua, which got between the skinne and the flesh
before they were aware, and there bred and multiplyed, making swellings
and putrefactions, to the decay and losse of their bodily members.
1622 561

What should I tell you that the Plantations diucrs times were neare
vndone, by the ambition, factions, and malice of the Commanders one
vnto another. Columbus, to whom they were beholding for all, with his
brothers, were sent home from the West Indies into Spaine bound with
chaines: and some other great Commanders killed and murthered one
another. Pizzarro was killed by Almagros sonne, and him Vasco beheaded,
which Vasco was taken by Blasco, and this Blasco was likewise taken by
Pizzarroes brother. Thus by their owne spightfull and auaritious quarrels
did they well-neare shake the mayne pillars of that Plantation.

These and many other calamities and mischiefes, too long to relate now,
hapned vnto them more then euer did to vs. And at one time their planta-
tion was euen at the last gaspe, all their Colony being resolued desperately
to leaue it, had not two ships vnexpected come in with new supplyes:
yet wee see for all these miseries, that they haue attained to their ends at
last, Honor, power, and wealth; In so much as that Countrey, which
(when they were dishartned with disasters) they beganne to be so weary of,
that they were about to forsake it all, in short time after (seeing all stormes
blowne ouer, and fayre weather shining vpon them) they were so in loue
with their great fortunes, that they grew so icalous of them, as made them
shut them vp from the sight of any but themselues. And then they peti-
tioned their King, by an inuiolable Decree to annexe and vnite the West
Indies inseparably for euer to the Crowne of Spaine; which (for their
better securitie and satisfaction) was accordingly performed and ratified, as
it is to be seene in Hereras His[30]tory of the West Indies. And whereas
before, few could be hired to go to inhabite there, now with great suite
they must obtaine it.

Thus haue they in time by industry, patience, and constancy effected
this great worke of theirs, notwithstanding to encrease their difficulties
also, they were to deale with a most populous & numerous nation, which
they ouereame at last: So as Oudedo in his third Booke of the first Part
of his West Indie History saith, that of a million of Indians at least, that
were in Hispaniola, there were not (in little more than forty yeares space
after the first beginning of the Plantation) fiue hundred of thé & all their
children liuing: for the Indians that liued there, after were brought out of
the Continent into that Tland, or out of one Tland to be planted in another.
562 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

On the other side, the Natiues in VIRGINIA are nothing populous, but
thin and scattered Nations, as is knowne to all.

Here by the way to make a little Digression, since I haue mentioned Ouiedo
who liued aboue twenty two yeares in the West Indies, I will acquaint
you with bis obseruation and iudgement of the nature and disposition of
the Indians there, that you may compare and see in what, and how farre,
it agrees with that of the Natiues of VIRGINIA.

They are (saith hee) by nature sloathfull and idle, vitious, melancholy,
slouenly, of bad conditions, lyers, of small memory, of no constancy or
trust. In another place he saith, The Indian is by nature of all people
the most lying and most ineonstant in the world, sottish and sodaine:
neuer looking what dangers may happen afterwards, lesse capable then
children of sixe [31] or seauen yeares old, and lesse apt and ingenious. This
is the generall disposition of most of them, though there be some (sayes he)
that. be wise and subtill. And indeede it should seeme so, when they could
ouerreach and goe beyond the Spaniard so much, to put that tricke of
staruing them (as aforesaid) vpon them, to their so great and almost totall
destruction.

But to come againe to that which I first intended: Since the Spaniard (as
we see) in his Plantations hath gone thorow farre more hazards, and
greater difficulties then euer wee haue had, we therefore in looking to what
is past, vpon great reason ought likewise not to be deterred, but so much
the rather inuited to proceede with constancy and courage. And if
besides wee looke (as most men doe) after the riches of a Countrey to
inuite vs on, aske those that haue beene there, and haue trauelled farre
and neare, and they will tell you, that no Countrey in the world doth
naturally abound with more Commodities then VIRGINIA doth. The
Clymate is knowne to be more temperate, and the soyle more rich then that
of the West Indies is: neyther doth it want mynes of all sorts, no not of the
richest, as is knowne to some now liuing, and shall be manifested when
fit time shall serue. And yet to thinke that Gold and Siluer mynes are
in a Countrey (otherwise most rich and fruitfull) the greatest wealth of a
Plantation, is but a popular error, as is that opinion likewise, That the
Gold and Siluer is the greatest wealth of the West Indies now at this
present time. True it is indeed, that in the first Conquest the Spaniards
1622 563

got great and mighty treasure from the Indians, which they in long space
had heaped vp together, [82] and in those times the Indians shewed them
entyre and plentifull rich mynes, which by length of time (as is well known
and published to the world by those that haue beene there) are wasted
and exhausted since, so as now the charge of getting those mettals is
growne most excessiue, besides the consuming and spoyling many men of
their liues, which are depriued of them by the vapors that come out of the
Gold and Siluer mynes, which are most pestilent and deadly, as diuers
authors auerre. Amongst others, a late Geographer speaking of the West
Indies, and of those mynes there, saith, Odor ex auri & argenti fodinis noxius
admodum; neq; tamen prohibuit aéris corruptissimi violentia Hispanos, ne
in alto orbe nouum moriendi locum quaeerent. So as all things considered
by these mynes, what by the liues of many men lost in them, and what
with the great charge otherwise in getting them, the cleare gaine to the
Aduenturers from these mettals (the Kings part defrayed) is but small! to
them, nothing neere so much I am sure, as is imagined. And were it not
for other rich Commodities there that enable and enrich the Aduenturers,
those of the Contractation house were neuer able to subsist by this. Tor
the greatest part of their gaine and profit I say consists not in these mynes,
but in their other Commodities, partly natiue, and partly translated from
other parts of the world, and planted in the West Indies: As in their mighty
wealth of Sugars (the Sugar-Canes being transported first from the Ca-
naries,) and in Ginger, and some other commodities deriucd from the
East Indies thither: in their Cochanile, their Indico, their Cotton, their
infinite store of Hydes and Skins, [33] their Quick-siluer, and Allom, Woad,
and Brasillwood, &c. And their many other Dyes, Paints, Petacaraua,
Tobacco, Gummes, Balmes, Oyles medecinall, and Perfumes, their Sar-
saparillia, and many other physicall drugs, (for which, learned Physitians
and skilfull Simplers were sent to take a suruey, and make an exquisite
draught of all the Plants in colours.) These I say and other the like com-
modities are the West Indies indeed vnto the Aduenturers, by which they
are inabled to inrich themselues, and to sustaine the mighty charge of
drawing out the Gold and Siluer, to the great and cleare reuenew of their

King.

I had many things of importance to say more, but I will detain the Reader
no longer now. ‘To conclude then, secing that Virgrnia is most abundantly
564 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

fruitfull, and that this Massacre must rather be beneficiall to the Planta-
tion then impaire it, let all men take courage, and put to their helping
hands, since now the time is most seasonable and aduantagious for the
reaping of those benefits which the Plantation hath long promised: and
for their owne good let them doe it speedily, that so by taking the prioritie
of time, they may haue also the prioritie of place, in choosing the best
Seats of the Country, which now by vanquishing of the Indians, is like to
offer a more ample and faire choice of fruitfull habitations, then hitherto
our gentlenesse and faire comportment to the Sauages could attaine vnto.
Wherein no doubt but all the fauour that may be, shall be shewed to
Aduenturers and Planters. And for old Aduenturers, there is due vnto
them and their heyres (according to the Orders of the Company) for each
twelue pounds ten shillings formerly paid [84] into the treasury, one hundred
Acres of Land, vpon a first diuision, and as much vpon a second, the first
being planted. And whosceuer transports himselfe or any other, at his
charge into VIRGINIA, shall for himselfe and each person so transported,
before Midsummer, 1625. haue to him and his heyres foreuer, fifty Acres
of land vpon a first Diuision, and as much more vpon a second: the first
fifty being cultiuated or manured, if such person continue there three yeares,
eyther at once or seuerall times, or dye after hee bee shipped for that Voyage.

Lastly, it is to be wished, that euery good Patriot will take these things
seriously into his thoughts, and consider how deeply the prosecution of
this noble Enterprise concerneth the honor of his Mazestie and the whole
Nation, the propagation of Christian Religion, the enlargement, strength,
and safety of his Maiesties Dominions, the rich augmenting of his Reuen-
nues, the imploiment of his Subiects idle at home, the increase of men,
Mariners and shipping, and the raising of such necessary commoditie, for
the importation of which from forren Countries so great and ineredible
summes are continually issued and expended. Some may helpe with their
purses, some with their persons, some with their fauour, some with their
counsell: especially amongst others, let Ministers in their publike and
priuate prayers commend these Plantations to the blessing of Almighty
God: To whom be all honor and glory, for euer and euer, Amen.

A TREATISE or THE NoRTHWEST PassaGE TO THE SOUTH SEA, THROUGH
THE Continent or VIRGINIA anv BY Fretum Hudson

The noble Plantation of VIRGINIA hath some very excellent Prerogatiues
aboue many other famous Kingdomes, namely, the temperature of the
ayre, the fruitfulnesse of the soile, and the commodiousnesse of situation.

The ayre is healthfull and free both from immoderate heate, and from
extreame cold; so that both the inhabitants and their cattell doe prosper
exceedingly in stature and strength, and all Plants brought from any other
remote climate, doe there grow and fructifie in as good or better manner,
then in the soyle from whence they came. Which though it doe manifestly
proue the fruitfulnesse of the soile, yeelding all kinds of graine or plants
committed vnto it, with a rich and plentifull encrease, yet cannot the
fatnesse of the earth alone produce such excellent effects, vnlesse the tem-
perature of the Ayre bee likewise so fauourable, that [46] those tender
sprouts which the earth doth abundantly bring forth, may bee cherished
with moderate heate and seasonable moisture, and freed both from scorching
drought, and nipping frost.

These blessings are so much the more to bee esteemed, because they are
bestowed vpon a place situated so conueniently, and at so good a distance
both from Europe, and the West Indies, that for the mutuall commerce
betwixt these great and most rich parts of the habitable world, there
cannot bee deuised any place more conuenient for the succour and refresh-
ing of those that trade from hence thither: whether they be of our owne
nation, or of our neighbours and friends; the multitude of great and naui-
gable Riuvers, and of safe and spacious harbours, as it were inuiting all
Nations to entertaine mutuall friendship, and to participate of those bless-
ings which God out of the abundance of his rich Treasures, hath so
gratiously bestowed some vpon these parts of Hurope, and others no lesse
desired vpon those poore people: which might still haue remained in their
old barbarous ignorance, without knowledge of their owne misery, or of
Gods infinite goodnesse and mercy; if it had not pleased God thus gratiously
both to draw vs thither with desire of such wealth as those fruitfull Coun-
tries afford, and also to grant vs so easie, certaine, and safe a meanes to
goe vuto them: which passage is in mine opinion made much more secure
1622 573

and easie by the commodious harbours and refreshing which VIRGINIA
doth reach out vnto vs. The coasts of Florida to the West, being not so har-
borous; and of New England to the East, somewhat more out of the way,
amongst so many [47] Flats and small [lands not so safe. Neither is the com-
modiousnesse of VIRGINIAS situation onely in respect of this west Alan-
ticke Ocean, but also in respect of the Indian Ocean, which wee commonly call
the South Sea, which lyeth on the West and North west side of VIRGINIA,
on the other side of the Mountains beyond our Fals, and openeth a free and
faire passage, not onely to China, Tapan, and the Moluccaes; but also to
New Spaine, Peru, Chila, and those rich Countries of Terra Australis, not
as yet fully discouered. For the Sea wherein Master Hudson did winter,
which was first discouered by him, and is therefore now called Mretum
Hudson, doth stretch so farre towards the west, that it lieth as farre
westward as the Cape of Florida: So that from the Fals aboue Henrico
City, if we shape our iourney towards the Northwest following the Rivers
towards the head, we shall vndoubtedly come to the Mountaines, which
as they send diuers great Riuers Southward into our Bay of Chesepiock, so
likewise doe they send others from their further side Northwestward into
that Bay where Hudson did winter. For so wee see in our owne Country,
from the ridge of Mountaines continued from Derbishire into Scotland,
doe issue many great Riuers on both sides into the East Germane Ocean,
and into the Westerne /rzsh Seas: in like sort from the Alpes of Switzerland
and the Grizons, do runne the Danubie Eastward into Pontus Euxinus, the
Rhene into the North Germane Ocean, the Rhosne west into the Mediterrane
Sea, and the Po South into the Adriatike Sea. This Bay where //udson
did winter, strecheth it selfe Southward into 49. degrees, and cannot be in
probability so farre dis[48]tant from the Fals as 200. Leagues; part of
the way lying by the Riuers side towards the mountaines from whence
it springeth: and the other part on the other side cannot want Riuers
likewise, which will conduct vs all the way, and I hope carry vs and our
prouisions a good part of it. Besides that Bay, it is not vnlikely that the
Westerne Sea in some other Creeke or Riuer commeth much neerer then
that place: For the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter, lying more
Westerly then Master Hudsons Bay by 190. Leagues in the same Sea, doth
extend it selfe very neere as farre towards the west as the Cape of California,

which is now found to be an Iland stretching it selfe from 22. degrees to 42.
1982-3338
574 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

and lying almost directly North & South; as may appeare in a Map of that
Tland which I haue seene here in London, brought out of Holland; where the
Sea vpon the Northwest part may very probably come much nearer then
some do imagine: who giuing too much credit to our vsuall Globes and Maps,
doe dreame of a large Continent extending it selfe farre Westward to the
imagined Straight of Anian, where are seated (as they fable) the large
Kingdomes of Cebola and Quiuira, hauing great and populous Cities of
ciuill people; whose houses are said to bee fiue stories high, and to haue
some pillars of Turguesses. Which relations are cunningly set downe by
some vpon set purpose to put vs out of the right way, and to discourage
such as otherwise might bee desirous to search a passage by the way afore-
said into those Seas.

Gerardus Mercator, a very industrious and excellent Geographer, was
abused by a Map sent vnto him, of foure Huripi meeting about the North
Pole; which [49] now are found to be all turned into a maineicie Sea. One
demonstration of the crafty falshood of these vsuall Maps is this, that Cape
Mendocino is set in them West Northwest, distant from the South Cape of
California, about seuenteene hundred Leagues, whereas Francis Gaule that
was imployed in those discoueries by the Viseroy of New Spaine; doth in
Hugo Linscotten his booke set downe their distance to bee onely fiue hundred
Leagues.

Besides this, in the place where Sir Thomas Button did winter in 57. de-
grees of latitude, the constant great tides euery twelue houres, and the in-
crease of those tides whensoeuer any strong westerne wind did blow, doe
strongly perswade vs that the maine Westerne Ocean is not farre from
thence; which was much confirmed vnto them the Summer following;
when sayling directly North from that place where they wintered, about
the Latitude of 60. degrees, they were crossed by a strong Currant running
sometimes Eastward, sometimes Westward: So that if wee finde either
Hudsons Bay, or any Sea more neere vnto the West, wee may assure our
selues that from thence wee may with great ease passe to any part of the
Fast Indies: And that as the world is very much beholding to that famous
Columbus for that hee first discouered vnto vs the West Indies; and to the
Portingall for the finding out the ordinary and as yet the best way that is
knowne to the Hast Indies, by Cape Bona-Speranza. So may they and all
1622 575

the world be in this beholding to vs in opening a new and large passage,
both much nearer, safer, and farre more wholesome and temperate through
the Continent of VIRGINIA, and by [50] Fretum Hudson, to all those rich
Countries bordering vpon the South Sea, in the Hast and West Indies. And
this hope that the South Sea may easily from VIRGINIA be diseouered ouer
Land, is much confirmed by the constant report of the Sauages, not onely of
VIRGINIA, but also of Florida and Canada; which dwelling so remote one
from another, and all agreeing in the report of a large Sea to the West-
wards, where they describe great Ships not vnlike to ours, with other cir-
cumstances, doe giue vs very great probability (if not full assurance) that
our endeuours this way shall by Gods blessing haue a prosperous and happy
successe, to the encrease of his Kingdome and glory amongst these poore
ignorant Heathen people, the publique good of all the Christian world, the
neuer-dying honour of our most gracious Soueraigne, the inestimable
benefit of our Nation, and the admirable and speedy increase and aduanee-
ment of that most noble and hopefull Plantation of VIRGINIA; for the good
successe whereof all good men with me, I doubt not, will poure out their
prayers to Almighty God.

Most humbly shewing vnto yo most excellent Ma‘ that by their long

Right Hono>” &ct. Wee Receaued you’ Letter bearinge date at London the
11 of September 1622! by the Warwick arived heere at James Cyttie
the 19th day of December, wherin you haue manifested so greate Ca[re]
of us, and the whole Colony, as we cannott but w'® all Thankfullnes,
acknowledg our selves much bounde vnto you for the same, before the
receipt of w*" Letter wee had (accordinge as §to§ the instructiones geven
us) taken order in the firste Sessione of the generall Assemblie, helde in
November and December, that greate store of Vines and mulbery trees,
should be planted in all places, and such as were growinge preserved,
and had expresly phibited the destroy[ing] of mulbery trees in the Cleeringe
of Growndes: Att w'* assemblie wee did playnly peeave that the whole
Countrey was very well affected to the plantinge of both, and to the
receavinge of Silke worm seede, And y* ys our ernest desire, that you
woulde be pleased to pceede in [in] this Course, and of sendinge us all
sortes of Vines in greate aboundance, as alsoe greate store of all sortes
of the best graine, as wheate Barlie Oates and pease of all the beste
kinde, for though wee bee very desirous to falle to the sowinge of all sortes
of our English graine as well as Indian (since this Countrey ys very pper
for them and that there ys much eleare grounde in the Colonie) wherin a

plowe may bee able to goe) yet are wee at this tyme very much vnpro-
vided of any good seede corne, for our wheate w* was firste brougth hither
from the ffrench Colonie, ys not onely of a smale and bad kinde but hath
alsoe beene much decaied (since it came hither) for wante of well Culti-
vatinge the grounde, As for Barlie oates and the best Pease, there ys
either none or a very smale quantetie of any of them in the Countrey,
And to y® ende that w* graine or seede soever, you shalbe pleased to sende
us ouer; may bee in the more likelyhood to prosper when it Cometh
hither, wee desire that A Care may bee taken, that the wheate and Barlie
may be brought in the Chaffe, And that such corne or seedes as you shall
sende, may bee noe older, then of the harvest next precedinge, And that
they may nott bee stowde in the holde butt betweene the Decks, for y*
the heate of the Holde will spoyle whatt Corne or seede soe ever you shall
sende, And wee doe conceave it to be very fitt, that what Shipps shalle
bringe such things, bee appoynted to Come the Northerne Course, and to
sett owte at such a tyme, as they may in all likeliehood arive heere about
September or October, w*" tyme alsoe and Coorse, wee holde to bee the
most healthfull for the Cominge in of Passengers, and theref[ore] coulde
wishe, that as fewe bee sent hither in the Springe of the yeere, as may bee,
seeinge y' of those 9 Shipps w arived heere this Autum, There hath §nott§
died one Passenger by the way, and haue hetherto had theire health’s
since theire Landinge. Wee haue receaved all such Provisiones as were in
those Shipps sent to the dutch and frenchmen, save onely the Cloath
sent to make them Apparell, w* wee feare was lost in the Tiger (taken by
the Turks) since wee cann by noe meanes heere thereof, Wee cannott give
you Condingne thankes for Sending hither this Magaseine soe well furnished,
to w%, wee shall to the vttermost of ou’ powers bee aide and asistinge in
all thing¢ wee may, that by the pfitable retourne ther[olf, the Adventure[rs]
may bee Encoraged to goe one Cherfullie in this Course, and to Establishe

onely wee are sorrie that yt a[rrived] heere soe late, that the most of this
yeers Tobacco was otherwayes disposed of before, b[ut we] are perswaded,
that yf m' Blanye bee faine to trust foorth any of his Comodities hee wil be]
noe looser therby, by reasone that the next yeers Tobacco, cannott butt

confidence w'" the natiives, and beinge desirous by all good meanes to
contynue and enlarge the same as a thinge very necessarie at the begininge
of his Gouerment did & w the advise and consent of the Counsell, sende
Capt Thorpe w* A Message and a presente, both to the great Kinge
Sasawpen ! formerly called Ocatan, and to his Brother Apochankano now
Mangopeesomon, whom he founde much satisfied w his cominge, though
they were before as they Confessed, in some Jealousie whethe™ our new
Gouernor, woulde Contynue the League or nott, Apochankano gave him
very good hope of theire Entertaininge of some of our famylies to live
amongst them, and of theire sendinge to Cohabitt w® us, and did confirme
a former pmise of Sendinge one to be our guide beyonde the falles to Certen
mines, w’® wee purpose to tye him vnto, Capt Thorpe §found§ by dis-
coursinge w” him, that he had more motiones of religione in him, then
Coulde be ymmagined in sce greate blindnes, for hee willinglye Acknowl-
eged that theirs was nott the right waye, desiringe to bee instructed in
ours and confessed that god loved us better then them, and that he thought
the cause of his Angre againste them, was theire Coustome of makinge
their Children black boyes He fownde alsoe that hee had some knowl-
edge of many of the fixed starrs, and had observed the north Starr and
the course of the Constellatione aboute y', and called the great beare
Manguahaian, w™ in theire Language signifies the same, and beinge then
in the midest of bis huntinge, did in Conclusione referr Capt Thorpe
touchinge all matters to a fourther Conference at Pomucke when he had
ended his huntinge,

The lande belonginge to the place of Gouernor was resigned to Sr. ffrancis
Wyatt, but of the hundred Tenantes w* should bee one that lande, hee
hath receaved only 46, There were more of Capt Argals Guarde alive,
but they are to bee made free, and for one, m’ Pountis will give you Satis-
factione who receaved him of Sr. George Yardley at his Landinge because
he was his Prentice by Indenture in Englande, As for the rest of the Ten-
antes Sr. George yardley denieth to make them good, And sayeth that
havinge made noe strong Agrement wt you at any tyme he holdeth nott
him selfe tyed vnto yt, And therfore should take it for a matter of great
Iniustice to bee Compelled thervnto, and in that you refused to accept
of his offer of the pffitts of his Tenante, yt was in you' pleasure soe to doe,

But he holdeth him selfe agreved, that you should now seeme to require
a farr greater matter at his handes, he after the refusall beinge bounde
To pforme neither, who sayeth alsoe that he did never place vppon the
Gou'nors lande aboue 117! psones, but that the residue of the 130?
were by him placed one y® compenies Lande, for theire benefitt, Now
seeinge Sr. George yardley denyeth that there was any Agrement made
betweene you and him for the makinge good of the 100 Tenantes vppon
the Gouernors Lande, we haue forborne to Compell him thervnto, vntill
wee Receave your further directiones therin, The oath of Counsellers
hath beene Administered to all the severall psones mentioned in that
Comissione, save only to mt Leach who cam nott to us, and m* Paulett
of whom wee weere duptfull, there beinge heere * * * of that name,
and neyther of them required it of us,: yt beingea matter of * * * ch
difficultie to finde owte one the suddene such a Convenient place for the
[2] Seateinge of the Thresurers Tenantes, as in our Judgment@ we thought
requisite, and that h[e}] would haue much endaungered the health of
his People, and been the meanes of the certai[n] losse of his next yeers
Cropp, to haue kept them longe wthowt ymployment about James
Cyttie, M’ Thresurer was owte of necessitie enforced to purchace for
him selfe owt of his owne private Estate 200 Acres of Lande beinge the
divident of A privat planter for the present ymployment of his People,
where they are yett remayinge, But th[e] Lande belonginge to the
place of Thresurer wee purpose as soone as may bee to haue allotte[d]
owte and the Tenant¢ belonginge thervnto placed thereone, The hke
Course wee purpose to take for the lande and Tenantes belonginge to the
Place of Phisitione who owte of the like necessitie was’ faine for the
present, To hire certaine howses and Clere grounde for the ymployment
of his People not farr from James Cyttie, The Secretaries Tenantes were
the last yeere placed at Achamak where soe many of them as remaine
alive, doe yett remaine, butt whether yt bee fitt they shoulde Contynue
there still or nott, yt is a matter very Considerable, since that place ys
soe farr from James Cyttie, And seeinge that of the twentie Tenantes

Articles drawne out of the Informaéon of John Bargraue Esquire shewinge
the seuerall abuses of the former gouernment of the plantagon of
Virginia

Shewing to yot Lo™ as I haue form%ly don both in Parliam' and Chancery.

That whereas the kings Ma** for y* advancemt of y® said plantaéon did

by pattent Encorporate a free Companie the body whereof Consistinge of

a Thrér or his Deputy 4 Counsello™ and xv Comon?s who being tyed to

make theire lawes aswell by the said pattent, as by certaine royall Instrue-

éons giuen by his Ma‘ according to y* lawes of England, and both they
the%selues and such as were admitted by them to be of ye Comp: were to
haue free trade in Virginia as by the sayd Pattent appearethe.

First your Petigoner Chardgeth 5* Thomas Smith To haue (Contrary to
his Mat® said pattent and royall instrucéons and to y° Coviion laws of
England) Caused to bee printed a certaine booke of Tiranicall gou9nmt
in Virginia, as by the said booke p'sented w* the sayd petiéon appeareth,
whereby many of the king subiect¢€ there lost theire liues, and were
brought into slauery, and the peti¢on? and those hee imploved were
thereby much dampnified to theire greate losse. That the said S* Tho:
Smith Alderman Johnson and others (contrary to y® said pattent and
instructons) by practice and facton haue framed a Companie w*h being
able by most voices to carrie the gou2nmt as they list, haue thereby made
a Monopoly of y* plantaéon and of y° labor of all y° planters there, sincking
and raiseinge y° prizes of Comodities as 3 or 4 of them list, barreing free
trade from anie other free of the Companie but themselues, selling theire
good¢ before theire faces, and by setting of prizes onely of Tobaeco and
Sarsafrasse, They Caused all other staple Comeodities to bee neglected

there, soe as 8 or 10 shipps goeing to Virginia in one yeare, all came from
thence emptie except the Megazine shippe. That the said S' Tho. Smithe
practizeing wth 3. 4. or 5 wh he termeth the Comp: by secrett instrucéons
giuen to y® gou?no" in Virginia to barre y° pet’ trade, by the Tirranous
laws there wh made it death to trade, by detaineing of y° pet™ goodé, by
fraudilent sale of them, and by makeing stay of his shipps, haue Piudiced
the pet’ and his ptner to y° valew of 6600"

That whereas y* pet’ hath made pffe of all theis abuses in y® Chancery
ypon a full hereing there before y* right ho” ye Lord Keeper, whoe findeing
it to bee matter of state referred the pet? to this ho™ board.

That this facéous and populer gou2nm' heare by voices founded on a
ioynt stock will (if it bee not piuented) lay y* foundagon of y* plantaéon
in such facéous and disordered matter that will make it uncapeable of
y* forme wh must hould it to England; This ioynet stocke therefore being
all spent and Ceased, the Cause of y™ gou9nm' by voices (being taken
away) this ill effect in the gen9all gou2nm* should likewise Cease to be
restrained, but this must be tenderly handled tell the forme of gou!nm‘
in Virginia bee setled,

That y° plantaton now subsistinge onely of y° publique servant¢ planted
by the lottaries and diu9s priuate Collonies some whereof are planted by
manie aduenturo™ others by one or a feiwe, The greater Colony will by
their manie voices carry y° gou2nm' from y° lesser And London together
wth y® Exchange, wth theire Vicitnity of place steared by y® gou?no™ to
worke his owne end@ out of them all, by makeing y* gou9no" in Virginia
his Creature he maie dispose of y* whole plantaéon or of anye private
mans estate as he list; This by experience I haue found true, and although
there hath beene of late good laws made to pluent it and y* the gou%m"
bee now in good hande, yet nothinge but y° altering of the forme Can doe
it, wh alteration to bee made according to y° increase of y° plantaéon,
is pmised by his Ma' instrucéons dated 22° Nouenbr: 4° Jaé

That y® body politick of ye Comp: being to Consist as aforesaid of a sett
nomber of wth y* Thrér or his deputy is to be of y° Corum, they being to
make theire laws according to y* laws of England, yf y* Trér or his deputy
shall doe any vnlawfull act or anye acte contrary to y°® form? orders made
APRIL 12 (?), 1622 607

in Co'te, not haueing y? full nomber, and y* any private aduenturo™ shall
receaue piudice thereby, they stand Llyable First of Censure by y°* state
for breach of theire Comission, secondly to y? Company, there being now
a law made in print against such act€ that punisheth them with dis-
franchisement. Thirdly they thate are wronged are to recouer damages
by law or equitie.

That yo" pet’ growneing vnder y® burthen of theis opp'ssions, hath since
his first entering into y° plantaton endeavoured a meanes of redresse
aswell for y° publique as for himselfe, and in thend draweinge it to a
meathod and forme hee tendered it to 8' Tho: Smith some 4 yeres since
together w'h a meanes to gaine a growing and increaseing stock, by erecting
a Megazin for the publique and makeing it y° Farmer to y° kinge of y°
sole importaéon of Tobacco, but hee notwthstanding his Ma‘ then offered
y® sole importaton for 5000" p annt, and yt there was then to bee re-
ceaued aboue 20 or 300001 of y* publique lottarie moneys, 5000'! whereof
would then haue made this stocke, hee then refuzed it, his deputy and
himselfe and some others ioyneing wth him dreamcing to take it them-
selues, as it afterward appeared when they offered 8 or 10000"! for it.

That there being now no waie left to make this publique stock but by
searching into y* old debt¢, and St Tho: Smithes grosse and vnexdinable
accompté, and the abuses of the gou!nmt J humblie intreate yo" Lo’ ayde
in y° obtaineing of a Comission from his Ma" for the exdininge, rectifyinge
and orderinge of the said gou!nm'; That thereby yo' pet? maie bee releeued,
the publique wrongs redressed and such a forme settled, that doeinge
right to all pties interessed in the plantaton, it may fixe the gou2nment
of Virginia in a dependensey on the Crowne of England.

That there is a learned treatice written by a Gent that calls himselfe
Ignotus Concerning the gou9nm' of Virginia; To which treatice the Courte
hath giuen good allowance; This the pet" intreatcthe maie likewise bee
brought in that there maie bee no helpe wanting that will giue furtherance

But since our last by the George dated in Januarie 1621 k itt hath pleased

allie endeuor to doe) nor forraine enemy subvert us w*? wilbe the master
peece of this great woorke, for since this late woefull experience hath
taught us, That our first and prineypall care should haue beene for o[wr]
safetie, by the necglect wherof the Plantaton, though it hath seemed to
goe one, in [a] hopefull and florishinge course, yett hath all this while,
gone butt soe much owt[e] of the way, And that it Could nott butt bee
subiect to much Damages to bee soe dispersedlie and promiscusely planted
w' our late reconsiled salvage enymies, Yt ys very necessarie for us yett
at last, to laye abetter and surer foundatione for y* tyme to Come And
since the place ys yett to seeke, to make Choyce of such a one, and there
to fortifie our selves, soe as wee may bee able to defend us even against
our most powerfull Enemyes, (and therfore we most humblie desire) that
you would be pleased to give us leave to remai[n] in such A place as wee
shall finde most fitt to seate vppone, for the discovery wh[ich] wee intende
this Summer to vse our best endeavors, And to that ende to graun{[f]
Comissione, That the generall assemblie heere may haue full power and
Awthorlitze] to remove to such aplace as they shall resolve one, and becuse
we cannott secu[re} our selves as wee shoulde (vnles wee vnite together in

distress vntill y° Plantatione hath a little recovered yt selfe and is some-
whatt settled, wee shalbe pvided of a sufficyent pportione of Corne,
wherin now the very life of the whole Colony consist, to feede soe many
mouthes as are heere, two third ptes wherof are women Children & vnserv-
isable people since there was never more cause to feare the miserable
ruine of y® Plantacone by a relapse into an extreame famine then at this
tyme, vnles out wante be supplide from home, for (besides the seasone of

night and daye for the safetie of the rest of the Howses, of the Cattlle,
and of the corne w shalbe planted, and many must be sent owt against
the Indyans, that we may be the more quiett and safe at home, neyther
can wee now plant corne in soe many places as we could wish (especyally
neere our howses, by reasone yt spreadeth all over all the grounde like a
thick groue, that the Indyans may hide themselves therin, who will from
tyme to tyme peeke out many of our people whilst they are about theire
weedinge and dressinge therof, and we haue great reason to doupt, since
they haue hertofore practized the like, that where wee doe plant any
Corne they will eyther Cutt it downe or destroy it in Summer before yt
bee ripe, or by stealth share w' us at Harvest, And as for our last and
beste refuge heere, which ys our gettinge of Corne eyther from our
freends by trade, or from our enemies by force, though wee will to our
vttermost endeuo' both, yt is very vneertaine and Hazardous, And therfore
we most humblie desire, that such A Sufficyent pportione of Corne, and
that very good and well Chosen, be sent as may be able to Sustaine the
whole Colonie this next yeere, yf neede shall soe require, and that noe man
be suffered to come Hither w'* out a yeers pvsione of corne at leste,
Another thinge of noe less moment then the former ys, Armes and
munitione of we there ys heere at this tyme so great wante, that at least
a thirde pte of men able to beare Armes are vtterly vnpvided therof, and
wowt w we cannott only not goe fourth to revenge us vppon our
enemyes, but shalbe even vnable to defend our selves at home, And ther-
fore shall alsoe desire y* some spedie course be taken for the sendinge of A
large quantetie therof, and y' a contynuall supplie may follow from tyme
to Tyme, And since wee are resolved to bestow much paynes in matter
of fortificatione where wee seate our selves, that you would be pleased
w* all speede to sende us some Skillfull Enginers fit? for such A woorke,
as alsoe great store of spades, shoveils, mattocks, Peekaxes, and other

our desire to be any way Chargeable vnto you, but as we are confident

St: As I was setting pen to paper to answer yo' letter, & to deliver my opinion
of the writings enclosed, there came to me M’ Bargrave, w a supersedens
from * * * venting my meditations upon his Articles. ffor (as y"
shail perceive by his to y* enclosed) he prayeth that y* forbeare answering
him till §after§$ the beginning of the Term: by w% tyme himself will be w**
y* again, & I as soon as he, or very soon after, if God permitt. But the
answer wilbe easie, & the trowble vanish like a spring mist: & therfore let
not this matter make anie addition to y°" iuster cares.

The other matter from the Spaniard@ is more wicked: conteining in it
matter untrue calumnious, & uniust. ffor it cannot be true, that they
were restrained from going immediately into Spanish §Dominions§, there
beeing no other Ships there then such as were for England. Then it is
palpably calumnious, that concerning their gold: w*" was not aleged to
the ends so ridiculous by them set downe: but only to disproove their
former allegation that they were robbed & stripped of all their gold.

Lastly to demand anie composition of the Companie $here§ is most uniust;
whom they cannot so much as charge to have anie way wronged them.

There is nothing therein reasonable, but their demand of leve to be gone:
w*? was also needles, there beeing no hinderance given them.
616 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

Y* shall doo well in my opinion to make a short answer in writing to their
petition: declaring what pains y" have taken to fynd out the trueth by
examinatid, whereby it hath appeared, that their informations were not
true in manie particulars. Howbeit if it please the LL. that the matter
be farther examined in the place where it was doon, & whether y" are very
shortly sending a nue Governo™ w* other Officers; y* shalbe very readie
to perform their LL’? Directions, & to §do§ all things w*? may give the
Complainants iust satisfaction from the Delinquents, if anie such be
found, But as for the Companie here, they have no cause to be aggreeved
w them, having no ways offended them, & having sincerely endevored
to try out the truth by all meanes, & to doo them all good offices w™ lay
in their power.

M’ Bargrave telleth me, (si credere dignum) that all the petitions to the
King against the Companie, are set on by 8" T. 8. & that w" all he directeth
to get them referred to him & his frends, wt he dooth no dowt to make
tryall of his integritie, how iustly he can carry himself beeing both accuser
& Judge. This next Term I nothing dowt we shall rid o selfs of these
brablements: w in the end will redound to their great disgrace w™
procure them. It is now late. The blessing of God be always upon y*.

Three things in my opinion y" are to have especiall regard of:
That the place be well seated, neer the mouth of the River:
That the Blockhouse be made durable, of strong materialls:

That the Captain put in good securitie for performance of what he under-

Whereas by the Right Honorable the Lord Keepers Decree it appeareth;
that S* Thomas Smythe and the other Defendants, had so sheltered them
selues vnder the name of the Company, that he could not iudge whether
the wrongs that were doon me, were the Companyes Acts, or the Defend-
ants J complayned of: By w*" meanes his L’* finding it to be matter of
State, forced me to complayne against the form of Governm'‘, and to desire
a Commission to examin and certifie the Governm' generally, thereby to
distinguish the Abvsers of the same. Now, So it is: That I doe freely

and voluntarily acknowledge, that my Complaint was grounded vpon the
abvse of the Governm' as it §was§ ordered in the time of 5' Thomas
Smythe, when taking to himself absolute power of Governing both the
Plantation and the Company according to his will, when no Lawes were
made to prevent faction and packing of Coorts, nor no order kept of
menaging businesses in publique Coorts lawfully assembled, but they were
carryed by private packings: the then Secretary framing, leaving out,
adding and entring the Orders of Coort w'" other Acts that concerned the
Company, as he was guided by the Combiners, for w he was since dis-
placed. No assurance given to the Planter either of his Estate or libertie,
Nor no Orders made to avoyd the engrossing of Trade into few hands,
nor no Course taken to prevent oppression of single Planters or small
Bodies of Adventurers by pluralitie of voyces of great numbers interressed
in any differences. But now finding vpon due examynation these things
rectified, partlie by Lawes established here for the Governm' of the Com-
pany: and also by Charters and Privileges confirmed to the Colony, w*
a promise of granting farther Privileges when it shall please his Ma’ to
grant farther authoritie to the Company Of w* reformation (beeing now
fully informed): I doe vtterly disclayme from laying any imputation vpon
the Governm' for these three yeares last past. And doe farther averr,
that in my opinion the Businesse of the Plantation could not have been
menaged wth more industrie or integritie then during that time it hath
been. In everie of w°h three yeares, there hath been more doon wth Ten
or Twelue Thousand pounds, whereof a true Account hath been made
then was before wth fowre score Thousand pounds spent w‘hout account
in Thirteen yeares. And whereas I have written five severall Treatises to
the maintenance of vnitie and peace in Virginia, and to the vniting of the
Governm' of it to the Soveraigntie of England: I would burn them all
together wth the hand that writ them, rather then they should be the
meanes to hinder the going forward of so Noble a Worke.

So there is 24, saile of Ships, with 500. Mariners in them imployed to these Planta-
tions in this yeere.

Besides, there are now prouiding seuerall Ships in diuers parts of this

Kingdome to transport to the Plantations aboue } SUL ELSE

And for the greater benefit of the Plantations, these things following haue been
here done this yeere.

16 Persons Italians, and others, haue been prouided and sent for the mak-
ing of Beads for trade in the Countrey with the Natiues, and for making
Glasse of all sorts.

57 Young maids haue bin sent to make wiues for the Planters, diuers of
which were well married before the comming away of the Ships.

A Magazine hath bin sent of all necessaries for the Colony, to the value of
2000. pound, besides al priuate mens sending goods, which was very ample,
Trade being set open for all his Maiesties Subiects.

A Ship called the Discouery, hath bin set out for the rich trade of Furres,
which both the French, and Hollanders haue yeerely within our precincts,
and within 50. leagues of vs.

25. Persons for the building of Boats, Pinnaces and Ships, for the neces-
sary vse of the Colony for fishing, trade, and Discouery, &e.

7. Persons sent for planting the 1000. aeres of land giuen to the Kast-India
Schoole.
Other occurrents of note.

The Gouernors arriuall in Virginia, at the end of the last Summer, with
9. Ships, and neare seuen hundred people, all safely, and in good health.

The admirable deliuerance of diuers Ships; and namely, of the Tiger,
which being driuen strangely neare 200. leagues out of her course, fell into
the Turkes hands, and yet came safe to Virginza.

Master Berkleys letters assure vs, that there is not a more fit place for
Iron-workes then in Virginia, both for wood, water, mines, and stone: and
that by Whitsontide next, we may rely vpon Iron made by him.
END OF MAY, 1622 641

The Plants of Cotton-wooll trees that came out of the West Indies, prosper
exceeding well, and the Cotton-wooll-seeds from the Mogols Countrey
come vp, and grow: Samples of it they haue sent; and this commodity
they hope this yeere to bring to a good perfection and quantity.

The Indico seed thriues well, but they yet want knowledge how to cure it.

Our Frenchmen assure vs that no Countrey in the world is more proper
for Vines, Silke, Ohues, Rice, &e. then Virginia, and that it excelleth their
owne Countrey. The Vines being in abundance naturally ouer all the
Countrey: a taste of which wine they haue already sent vs, with hope the
next yere to send vs a good quantity.

There be Mulbery trees in wonderfull abundance, and much excelling both
in goodnesse and greatnesse those of their Countrey of Languedeck. To
the full perfecting of both which rich commodities of Wine and Silke, there
wanteth nothing but hands. And of the Mulberies may bee made also
good wholesome Wine for the people there.

And of a certain Plumme in the country they haue made good drink.

Salt-workes are erecting (the proper place being now found, as the
Roecheller doth certifie vs) whereby many Ships will transport people at
easier rates hereafter, finding Salt there to furnish them for the great and
profitable fishings vpon that Coast, whither 20. saile of Ships went this
last yeere out of the Westerne parts of England, besides the Ships formerly
mentioned.

Master Zohn Porey hath of late made a disecouery into the great Bay
Northward (yet at the bottome of it he was not, reseruing it to a second
Voyage) where are now settled neare 100. Hnglish very happily, with
hope of a good Trade of Furres there to be had. And Terra Lemnia was
sent vs from thence, which is found as good as that of Turkey, and is in
great abundance to be had.

In February last he likewise discouered to the South Riuer, some 60.
miles ouer land from vs, a very fruitfull and pleasant Countrey, full of
Riuers, wherein are two haruests in one yeere (the great King giuing him
friendly entertainment, and desirous to make a league with vs) hee found

also there in great quantity of the same Silke-grasse, (as appeareth by the
samples sent vs) wherof Master Heriott in his booke 1587. makes relation,
who then brought home some of it, with which a piece of Grogeran was
made, and giuen to Queene Hlizabeth, and some heere who haue liued in
the East Indies affirme, that they make all their Cambaya Stuffes of this,
and Cotten-wooll.

Also in his passage by land, Master Porey discouered a Countrey, full of
Pine trees, aboue twenty miles long, whereby a great abundance of Pitch
and Tarre may be made: and other sorts of woods there were, fit for
Pot-ashes and Sope-ashes.

The Indians haue made relation of a Copper-mine, that is not far from
thence, how they gather it, and the strange making of it: a piece whereof
was sent home, being found (after triall) very excellent metall. Some
of the English haue made relation of a China box seene at one of the
Kings houses, who declared, that it was sent him from the West, by a King
that dwels ouer the great hils, whose Countrey is neare the Sea, he hauing
that box from a People, as he said, that come thither in Ships, and weare
clothes, and dwell in houses, and are called Acanackehina. And he offered
our people that he would send his brother along with them to that King:
which the Gouernour purposeth not to refuse, hoping thereby to discouer
the South Sea, so long talked of.

A small Ship comming in December last from the Summer-Ilands, to
Virginia, brought thither from thenee these Plants, vz. Vines of all sorts,
Orange and Leman trees, Sugar canes, Cassado roots (that make bread)
Pines, Plantans, Potatoes, and sundry other Indian fruites and plants,
not formerly seene in Virginia, which begin to prosper very well.

After o" very heartie Comendaéons: The late arivall of all the Shippe
and people sent this last yeare to Virginia, hath bredd such abundance
of ioy as could not be contained amongst o° selues, but hath declared it
self by publique thanksgiueinge vnto God Allmightie, that of the richnes
of his mercies through all waies and passages, so securely conducted yo:
This vnexpected blessing doth much encouradge vs, in the middest of
many difficulties, wt an assured hope, that the indignation of God is
now at last appeased and that his gratious favo" shall henceforth lead yo"
on successfully in all thinge@: And this we hope the rather, by the good
enterance w*" we vnd'stand yo" haue made in the Iron worké, and other
staple Comodities; wherin we most earnestly intreat yo" w* all constancie
and dilligence to proceed: for there is now an absolute necessitie vppon vs
to make good and that speedily, by reall proofe some of those thing¢,
w't the exportation of w" we haue so long posessed the world. wherefore
as yo" owne welfare and the advancement of y° Plantation is deare and
pretious vnto yo", or if o° loues and endevo™ haue deserued ought at yor
hand€; we pray and intreat you not to faile in the pformance of what
we in yo" behalf¢ haue promised; and let vs haue at least by the next
returnes, some good quantitie of Iron and Wyne; that w*> yo" sent by
the George was by long ecarrieing spoiled but principally, by the Mustie
JUNE 10, 1622 647

Caske wherein if was putt, so that it hath been rather of seandall then
creditt vnto vs.

His Mate aboue all thing¢ requires from vs a proofe of Silk; sharply
reprovinge the neglect thereof, wherefore we pray yo" lett that little
stock yo" haue be carefully improued, the Mulberie trees preserued and
encreased, and all other fitt preparations made, for, God willinge, before
Christmas yo" shall receiue from vs, one hundreth ounces of Silkworm
seed at least, w° comeinge to late from Valentia we haue been forced to
hatch it here.

All those supplies of Corne and seede, w™ yo" desire, shall, assoone as
new comes in, be sent you, not doubting but there wilbe more care had to
preserue them, then formerly hath been.

The Silkgrasse sent home by m* Pory, whose paines and discouties we
much esteeme, is avouched vnto vs, by them that haue long lived in the
East Indies to be the same of w* the Cambaya stufes are made, we pray
yo" therefore and him in pticular, to endevo" to procure some good
quantitie of it, that experience may be made thereof.

The proiect of Capt Newce concerninge the altering of the Condiéons w®
o? Tenant€ hath been the more carefully considered of by vs, in regard it
was recommended by yo" in generall, but as yett we are come to no deter-
mination thereof, through the interupéon of many and waighty bussineses,
w haue wholie taken vpp of times, and w* we could by no meanes waue,
but we shall time enough giue answer therevnto: In the meane while we
desire, that no alteration be made, but that the best may be donne accord-
ing to the course therein.

Wee haue much and very carefully labored in the matter of Fortification,
wh yo" so much presse, but haueinge fruitlesly attempted diu™ waies,
Capt Each maister of the Abigaile made offer vppon the assurance of
60000 waight of Tobacco homward¢ at 34 p pound fraight to carrie
twelue Carpenters w® him, by whom and his owne Mariners, together
wt the asistance of the Collony, layeinge his Shipp nere Blunt point he
wold erect before the end of March vppon the Oyster banke, a Block-
House, that should forbid the passage of any Shipp vpp higher in the
648 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

River. Wee haue many times advised w* the Planters lately come over,
and by the opinions and entreatie of them all, assuring vs it wilbe a most
necessarie and welcome busines, haue agreed w'* Cap* Hach, to sett for-
ward from the Ie of Wight the begining of August next; and although
the Company at plsent be much indebted, neere two thousand poundé, yet
for the effectinge hereof they haue not refused to bestow neare 300" in
Instrument¢ and other provisions necessarie: the repayment whereof they
will expect this plsent yeare from the Collony, for whose safty and securitie
they doe it: wee send yo" here the plott of that w he hath proposed vnto
vs, that by consideration thereof yo" may be the better prepared.

The Companies debt¢ here at home, makes vs very solicitous, w haveing
grown not for o’ owne occaéons here, whereas yo" well know all thing? are
donne freelie, but for the advancmt and and good of the Plantation, and
Collonie; we cannot but desire yo w haue the greatest benefite, to take
likewise vppon yo" part of the care for the sattisfacéon thereof, that
neither the Company be disinabled and dishonored, nor those private
psons who stand engaged for them, endamaged, whose desert€ towardé
yo"; as in this so in all other thinge haue been very great: wherefore we
earnestlie intreat yo", to be all assistant in what possible yo" may: to
those whose pticular charge it is, for the improueinge and recou'inge of
the Companies debt¢ and revenewes.

The Tobacco sent home by the George for the Company, proues very
meane and as yett vnsould although it hath beene offred att 3° the pound.
This we thought fitt to advise yo" concerninge the quantitie and the
maner, how it is raised in both w* being don contrarie to theire directons
and extreamly to theire preiudice, the Companie is verie ill sattisfied
wee will by the next write more largely.

[224] Next the publique, wee must againe recomend vnto yo" the last years
vnd'takinge of the Glasseworke, the ffurrs, the Maid¢, and the Magazine,
that each of them respectiuelie may haue yo" best fauo" and assistance; so
that although they haue missed of the sent return w% they expected,
yett in the end the good proceed of thetre Adventures may enable and
encouradg them to go one, in these and the like necessarie kinde of sup-
plies, w™ haue here risen, not out of the supfluitie of theire estates, but
out of theire charitie and great zeale w they beare vnto the Plantation,
JUNE 10, 1622 649

w by the delay of one yeare is sett so much backward, whereof the
damage is the Collonies, and o™ the discontent and griefe, who would
willingly haue continued o* yearely supplies, if we might haue been
answered as was fitt, w' yearely returnes, whereof we see no iust cause
to the contrarie. Wee vnd'stand that m* Pountis his care & charitie in
the providing for the Maide hath been very abundant, for w not onely
the pticular Adventurers, who haue sent him a remembrance of theire
loues, but the whole Company returne him verie hartie thanke: But
whereas we are informed by some private letters, of his purpose to come
to England this yeare, if it be not grounded one waightier reasons then
are alledged we earnestly intreate him to stay considering both in regard
of his skill and office, there wilbe speciall need of his assistance in the
building of the forte and otherwise: Jn this request the Adventurers of
Southampton hundred ioyne, who by the good entrance that he hath
made in theire bussines haue conceived much hope of the bettering theire
Plantaéon; and for the ordering of the Discoverie, and the proceed¢ of
her vioadge w** hath been a Marveilous charge vnto them, they do much
relie vppon his help. The reward of the great patnes and care w** we
and they by the seu'all employm** haue putt vppon him, shalbe to the
vttermost of theire §our§ abillities and we doubt not to his full content;
for the pformance whereof we desire creditt onely till the arivall of the
Abigaile. One thinge more in pticuler we are to intreat him: that whereas
there haue been a deliu'ie of certaine kine and Calues, vnto him by m*
Woodall¢ appointm' that he do not proceed in the sale or disposinge of
any more of them then are already sold, till they haue further order from
the Company, who conceiue themselues much wronged in the deliu'y of
so many, besid@ that there is claime made by others vnto that debt
vppon w* m* Woodall had the order for the Catle.

In this Shipp cometh over Capt Tho: Barwick w" fiue and twentie other
psons vnd? his goverm', for the building of boate, Shippe, and Pinnaces,
vppon w*" they are onely to bee employed: the list of theire names, the
Copies of their severall Covenant, and the Invoyce of their provisions
we send yo" here along, to the intent that by the knowledge of these pticu-
lars, yo" cares and favo" might the better help forward this busines:
there is not any thing of this nature, as hath put vs to so much troble and
charge as this Proiect hath donn: wherefore as the most difficult, we most
650 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

especially recomend it vnto yo", desiringe yo" that all the psons in generall
may be cherished, so in pticular Capt Tho: Barwick may find from you
that favo" and respect, as may better enable him for the pformance of
his place, And as of all in generall, so in pticular, we verie earnestlie
request m* George Sandys from whom at first this proiect in parte moved,
to haue an especiall regard vnto the proceeding? thereof, and that he
would be pleased to take the accompt¢€ of Capt Tho: Barwick and to
transmitt the profitt@ accordingly as they shall grow due from time to
time, vnto the Adventurers: Our desire is that they should be sett downe
altogether in one place, where after the convenient housinge of themselues,
they should all liue, and worke together in theire seu'all trades: the
choosinge of a place is lefte to yo™ and their owne iudgmenté, so as there
may be at the least 1200 acres of land appropriated vnto it; and for the
better easing of them in drawinge of their Tymber, the Company haue
graunted to lend him foure of theire Oxen, w™ we pray yo" cause to be
deliu’ed vnto them.

There comes also along one Leonard Hudson a Carpenter w"® his wife
and fiue of o* Apprentices for the erecting of the East India Schoole, the
monies would not reach vnto the sending of an Vsher as was first intended;
and besides vppon a second consideration, it was thought good to giue
the Collony the choise of the Schoolem'; or Vssher, if so be there be any
there fitt for the place, if not, we desire to vnd'stand what proportion of
manteinance they will alowe and accordingly, wee will do o° best, to procure
from hence an honest, and sufficient man for such a charge. The building
of a Schoole and setting out the land at Charles Cittie is not so absolutely
required, but that if an other place shalbe iudged more convenient by the
Colonie, it is lefte to yo" choise; but that there be such a proportion of
Jand some where laid out, and that those people now sent be kept together
for cultivating the land and building of a howse; may not vppon any
reason whatsoever be altred: wherefore wee pray yo" to lett the buissines
proceed in that course, where in the notice of a good begininge, we are
assured will stirr vpp the mind¢ of diu™ good people to add liberaly to
this foundation: There is very much in this buissines that wee must leave
to yo" cares and wisdomes; and the help and assistance of good people,
of w* we doubt not.
JUNE 10, 1622 651

[23] Wee send over m™ Wiltm Leate a minister recomended vnto vs, for

privat socictie; we shall expect the charge of 26" we y’ Comp[any] hath
laid out for him, to be returned by the first in good Tobaeco 18¢ p! and
not aboue: and in this and the like kind, we especially desire the care
of m" George Sandys, that by the returne of the stock€ we may be
enabled to continue the supplies.

The good endevo"™ of m’ Berkley we kindly accept, and haue sent him and
his people diu’ provisions w he writt for; ffor matter of apparell he must
supplie that out of the Magazines we haveing beyond ot liberties strained
o' selues; but the Adventurers of Southampton hundred desire that he
may, out of theire store, haue fine kine deliu'ed him and his Company.

There is likewise sent some provisions for the French men, and the next
Shipp shall bring their apparell, there wadges haue been paid here to m‘
Bonall, theire kind vsage, and the instructing and training vp of many
in their skill¢ and arte, are thinge we especially reeomend vnto yo".

The Adventurers of the Glasse, haue sent Capt Norton a good supplie, the
Copie of all w® Invoyces, together w that of Martins hundred, we send
here inclosed: that yo" might the better right them, if by the negligence,
and default of the Mariners, the suffer any damage.

Vppon the good pformance of this Vioadge by the Maister, we desire yo"
to aford him all the favo’ and curtesie that yo" may, the owners and
vnd'takers of the Shipp being psons likly by large Adventures much to
advance the Plantation.

m‘ Robert Paulett the Minister, was he whom the Court chose to be of the
Counsell, for m’ Harwood the Adventurers of Martins hundred desire that
he might be spared from that office, theire bussines requiring his presence
continually.

The last thing that we will conclude w* is, that it hath pleased my Lord of
Southampton for one yeare more to accept of the place of Treasuror, and
the Lo: Cavendish of the goverment of the Sumer Hande.

Right trusty and Right welbeloved Cousins & Councello™ and Right trusty
and welbeloved Councello™ wee greet you well. As it is our part not to
denye Iustice vnto any of our Subiecte that shall find themselues grieved,
nor haue wee ever stopped the due Course thereof, but rather removed all
Impedimente that might hinder our subiecte iust reliefe vpon complaint
made vnto Vs; So on the other side doe wee holde it to be no lesse o* duty
to free them from vniust vexation and Clamo" when causes are once deter-
mined, and yet the Suite pursued onely to molest and weary the Defendant.
Such (as wee are informed) is the Cause betwixt S' Thomas Smith and
one John Bargraue, who having (as was supposed) matter of Complaint
against him the sayd S* Thomas Smith, the same was heard at large
iudicially by the Lo: Keeper of our Greate Seale of England, and denied
by him, wth as much favo" on the behalfe of Bargraue, as in equity and
conscience the Cause would beare. Notw'thstanding, Bargraue still pur-
sues the Complaint against him before you at the Councell Boord; where
though $* Thomas Smith doubts not to find the like Iustice, if there were

128233 —43

cause to haue the same heard againe before you, yet seeing this incessant
importunity of the Plaintif seemes to haue no other end then to blemishe
his Reputaéon wh hetherto wee acknowledge he hath ever helld wth vs
to bee an honest & discreet and well deserving Man both of Vs and y°
Coffion wealth, Our pleasure is, that vnlesse you find other reason to the
Contrary not knowne to vs, you entertayne the Complaint no longer at
the Table, but to dismisse it, as a matter allready fully determined. And if
notw'hstanding you shall find the Plaintif still contentious, That in such a
Case you inflict such punishment upon him as his presumption shall
deserve. Given at o? Manot of Greenewich the xvij of June in the

Right trusty and welbeloued, We greet you well: Whereas We vnderstand,
that the Soyle in Virginia naturally yeeldeth store of excellent Mulbery
trees, We haue taken into Our Princely consideration, the great benefit
that may grow to the Aduenturers and Planters, by the breed of Silke-
wormes, and setting vp of Silkeworkes in those parts. And therefore of
Our gracious Inclination to a designe of so much honour and aduantage to
the publike, Wee haue thought good, as at sundry other times, so now
more particularly to recommend it to your speciall care, hereby charging
and requiring you to take speedy order, that our people there, vse all
possible diligence in breeding Silkewormes, and erecting Silkeworkes, and
that they rather bestow their trauell in compassing this rich and solid
Commodity, then in that of Tobacco; which besides much vnnecessary
expence, brings with it many disorders and inconueniences. And for as
much as Our seruant, Iohn Bonoeil hath taken paines in setting downe the
true vse of the Silkeworme, together with the Art of Silkemaking, and of
planting Vines, and that his experience and abilities may much conduce
to the aduancemét of this busines; We doe hereby likewise require you to
cause his directions, both for the said Silkeworkes and Vineyards, to bee
carefully put in practice thorowout our Plantations there, that so the
worke may goe on cheerfully, and receiue no more interruptions nor delayes.

Giuen vnder Our Signet, at our Palace of Westminster, the ninth day of
luly, in the twentieth yeere of our Raigne of England, France and Ireland,
and of Scotland the fiue and fiftieth.

To Our right trusty and right welbeloued Cousin and Councellour, HENRY,
Earle of South-hampton, Treasurer of our Plantation in Virginia, and
to Our trusty and welbeloued, the Deputy, and others of Our said
Plantation.

Tue TREASVROVR CoVNCELL AND Company oF Virginia, To THE GouER-
NOUR AND COUNCELL OF STATE IN VIRGINIA RESIDING.

After our very hearty commendations: His Sacred Maiesty, out of his
high wisedome and care of the noble Plantation of Virginia, hath been
graciously pleased to direct his Letters to vs heere in England, thereby
commanding vs to aduance the setting vp of Silke workes, and planting of
Vineyards; as by the Copy herewith sent, you may perceiue.

The intimation of his Maiesties pleasure, wee conceiue to be a motiue
sufficient, to induce you to imploy all your indeuours to the setting forward
those two Staple Commodities of Silke, and Wine; which brought to their
perfection, will infinitely redound to the honour, benefit and comfort of
the Colony, and of this whole Kingdome: yet we, in discharge of our duties,
doe againe renew our often and iterated Instructions, and inuite you cheer-
fully, to fall vpon these two so rich, and necessary commodities. And if
you shall finde any person, either through negligence or wilfulnesse, to omit
the planting of Vines, and Mulbery trees, in orderly and husbandly man-
ner, as by the Booke is prescribed, or the prouiding of conuenient roomes
for the breeding of Wormes; we desire they may by seuere censures and pun-
ishment, be compelled thereunto. And on the contrary, that all fauour
and possible assistance bee giuen to such, as yeeld willing obedience to his
Highnesse Commands therein. The breach or performance whereof, as
we are bound to giue a strict account, so will it also be required of you
the Gouernour and Councell especially. Herein there can be no Pica,
either of difficulty or impossibility; but all the contrary appeares, by the
naturall abundance of those two excellent Plants afore-named eucry where
in Virginia: neither will such excuses be admitted, nor any other pretences
serue, whereby the businesse be at all delayed: and as we formerly sent at
our great charge the French Vignerons to you, to teach you their Art; so for
the same purpose we now commend this Booke vnto you, to serue as an
Instructour to euery one, and send you store of them to bee dispersed ouer
the whole Colony, to euery Master of a Family one. Silk-seed you shall
receiue also by this Ship, sufficient to store euery man: so that there wants
nothing, but industry in the Planter, suddenly to bring the making of
Silke to its perfection: which either for their owne benefit (we hope) they
will willingly indeuour, or by a wholesome and necessary seucrity they
must be inforced.
664 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

This particular aduice we thought necessary to giue you, lest that if it
should haue come to you mingled with others, you would haue interpreted
it as a common Instruction, or a businesse that was not taken so to heart,
as this is by vs, and we hope will be by you in humble obedience to his
Sacred Maiesties Royall Instructions. The paines and industry of the
Authour, for the benefit of the Plantations (being a member of our Com-
pany) are sufficient arguments of his good affection to the Action, and they
both deserue your best acceptance and ours, that others may thereby be
inuited to impart their knowledge in businesse of this and the like nature;
whereby the Colony may not onely bee supported for the present, but
brought to that perfection, that may redound to the glory of God, the
honour of his Maiesty, and the inestimable benefit of his noble Kingdomes;
which as they are the true aime and end the Aduenturers and Planters
haue proposed vnto themselues; so ought they to bee still the honorable
seeds to put others also forward in this action: we commend this businesse
againe to your speciall care. And so we commit you all, and your waighty
affaires, to the protection of the Almighty.

To our very loving frends 8" Francis Wyatt knight Governor & Captaine
generall of Virginia; and to the rest of the Counsell of state there
August the first 1622

After of very hartie Comendations;

Wee haue to o* extreame grief vnd'stood of the great Massacre executed
on o™ people in Virginia, and that in such a maner as is more miserable
then the death it self; to fall by the hand¢ of men so contemptible; to be
surprised by treacherie in a time of known danger; to be deafe to so plaine
a warning (as we now to late vnd'stand) was last yeare given; to be secure
in an oecaéon of so great suspition and iealousie as was Nenemathanewes
death; not to peeiue any thing in so opne and generall conspiracie; but to
be made in parte instrument¢ of contriving it, and almost guiltie of the
destrueéon by a blindfold and stupid entertaininge of it; wh the least
wisdome or courage suffised to prevent even on the point of execuGon:
are circumstances, that do add much to o* sorrow & make vs to confesse
that it is the heavie hand of Allmightie God for the punishment of o
and yo" transgressions: to the humble acknowledgment and pfect-amend-
ment whereof together wt" of selues, we seriously advise and invite yo";
and in pticular earnestly require the speedie redresse of those two enor-
mous exesses of apparell and drinkeing; the erie whereof cannot but haue
gon vp to heaven; since the infamie hath spredd it self to all that haue
but heard the name of Virginia to the detestaéon of all good mind‘, the
scorne of others, and o* extreame griefe and shame: In y° strength of
those fault®, vndoubtedly, and the neglect of the Devine worshipp, haue
the Indians prevailed, more then in yo" weaknes; whence the evill there-
fore sprung the remedy must first begin: and an humble reconciliation be
made w* the devine Ma** by future conformitie vnto his most iust and
holie lawes: w doinge we doubt not but that you shall be safe from the
handé of all yo" enemies, and them that hate yo": from whom if Gods
AUGUST 1, 1622 667

protecéon be not wtt yo" no strength of scituation can saue yo": and w
it we conceiue not but where yo" be yo" may make yo' selues as secure as
in any other place whatsoeu': and in all other respect, the chaung cannot
be but to the worst, nay to the vtter overthrow, not only of all o* labo®
& charg past, but to the frustrating of 07 intentions, and hopes, and the
expectation of his Ma" and the whole state: wherefore yo" shall do well
so wholie to abandon the thought thereof, as in this point not to returne
vs any answer: Spartam quam nactus es hane exorna: there to applie
all yor thought and endevo™, and in especiall to the setting vpp of
Staple Comodities, according to those often instrucéons, and reiterated
advises that wee haue continually given yo": the want whereof hath been
the truest obiection against y° succcedinge of this Plantation, and the
greatest hindrance and impediment (as we coneeiue) that his Mati and
the State haue not sett to a more liberall hand to the furtherance thereof
but now at last it hath pleased God for the confirmation, no doubt, of o°
hopes, and redoubling of o" and yo" coradges, to encline his Mat* Royall
heart, to graunt the sole importation of Tobacco (a thing long and
earnestly desired) to the Virginia and Sumer Ilands Companies: and that
vppon such condiéons as the private profitt of each man is likely to be
much improved, and the generall state of the Plantation strongly secured,
whilest his Mat: Revenue is so closely ioyned as together wt the Col-
lonie it must rise, and faile, grow and empaire, and that not a smale
matter neither, but of twenty thousand pound p ann (for the offer of so
much in certainty hath his Mat'* been pleased to refuse in fauo™ of the
Plantations) The good effect¢ likely hence to ensue are to obvious for
vs to sett downe, and phapp¢ greater then we can imagine; this only in
generall we may assure o'selues and yo", that there shalbe no iust favo"
tending to the advancement of y* Plantaéon that we may not hope from
his Mate, who vppon o? humble petiton and the mediation of the Lord¢
of his most Hono” Privie Counsell, hath out of his Royall bountie been
pleased to bestow vppon vs diu™ armes (although in these part€ vnserv-
iceable, yett) such as against the Indians may be verie vsefull; we we
doubt not but by the Abigaile to send yo"; and are further put in an
assured hope to obtaine the number of 400 young men, well furnished
out of England and Wales at 20' a person, to repaire wt advantage the
number that is lost, to sett vpp the publiq revenues of the Companie, and
668 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

sattisfie the desert of worthie persons in the Colony; this supplie we hope
to procure, so as they may be w yo" before the Spring. The feare of
yor want of Corne doth much perplex vs, seeing so little possibility to
supplie yo", the publique stock being vtterly as yo" know exhausted, and
the last yeares Adventures made by Private men not returned, as was
promised, we haue no hope of raising any valuable Magazine, but rather
feare to see the effect of what we forwarned by the Warwick; Other waies
and meanes are so vneertaine, as wee [24] cannot wish yo" to rely vppon
any thing, but yo’selues, yet shall there not be left any mean|s] vnatempted
on o' part¢ in this kind, and for other necessaries to supplie yo", hoping
that the danger of this extremitie will hence forward pswade yo" not to
comitt the certaintie of yo" liues to the vneertainty of one harvest: and
that at last yo" will vnd‘stand, it is as fitt and necessarie to yeeld the
return of Adventures yearely as to receiue them: but of these thing[s]
the Abigaile shall not only bring yo" further notice, but we hope in some
part the pforman[ce] whose stay hath by these last newes been a litle
prolonged but by the end of the Month wee doubt not to dispatch her;
o’ designes in her entertainm' we advised of by the Furtherance but now
send it yo" more fully expressed in the Order of the Quarter Court: to the
accomplishing whereof we earnestly desire yo" to applie yo" vttermost
endevo™: although phapp¢ it may proue in the effect, of lesse consequence
then we desire, and of greater difficultie in the execuéon, then is pro-
pounded; yet it canot be but the bare name of a Forte will proue of
more worth then the charges and paines required therevnto. The pticu-
larities of the pformance, we must reserue till the Shipp it self come, only
now we thought necessarie to let yo" vnd'stand that the Company, hath
covenanted vppon the effecting of the bussines to make the fraight of the
Shipp homeward 800! w* they haue cast to pforme by the ladinge aboard
of threescore and foure thousand waight of Tobacco at 34 p 1: and at
this price the generall Company, the Adventurers of the ioynt stock, of
m’ Blaneys Magazine, of Southampton hundred (who haue refused for
theire owne and the Collonies benefitt the imployeing of the Discoverie
in Virginia) and of Martins hundred haue agreed and ordered that their
Tobacco shalbe brought home in the Abigaile, w*" we desire yo" take order
may be pformed accordingly. The procuring of the rest to make vp the
former quantitie is the thing we are now most seriously to recomend vnto
AUGUST 1, 1622 669

yo" cares w"" vppon this timely advise (before by the coming of so many
Shipp¢ thing¢ before stated) we doubt not yo" will verie eascly effect, the
price being so indifferent, the conveyance so safe, and good, and the delay
of a litle time in the comeing home of the Tobacco no disadvantage at
all, by reason of the contract that we haue lately concluded w® his Mat*;
so that we doubt not, but by the volluntarie offers of private men, yo"
may raise the full quantitie for fraight, w° otherwise by authoritie must
be provided, that neither the Company be dishonored by breach of their
Covenant€ w" Capt Each, nor much lesse be endainaged, in that w® for
the Collonies good only, they haue vnd'taken.

There come now over in this Shipp, and are imediatly to follow in some
others many hundrede of people, to whom as we here think o’selues bound
to giue the best encouragmente for theire goinge in reguard (that yeu Sin§
the want of a publique stock) there is no way left to encrease the Planta-
tion, but by abundance of private vnd'takers; so we thinke yo" obliged,
to giue all possible furtherance and assistance, for the good enterteining,
and well settling of them, that they may both thriue & prosper and others
by theire welfare be drawne after them: This is the way that we conceiue
most effectuall for the engageing of this State, and securing of Virginia, for,
in the multitude of people is the strength of a Kingdome: The allotting
out of pticular Divident¢, and the setlinge of private psons, we leaue
(vntill thinge may receiue a better force) vnto yo" wisdomes and iudge-
ment¢; not doubting but yo" will find out some course as shall giue content
to reasonable minde; w*" we very much desire may be donn, as farr as
civill life and securitie will pmitt, both w*" together w* religeon it self, by
this inordinate stragglinge run hazard of perishinge; w*® error by so
hard a chastizment, we hope from hence forward they will be willing of
themselues to amend, if not yo" authoritie must restreine them, not suf-
fering any to plant or sett down any where, but w so sufficient a number
of able men and well provided, as may, not in theire owne, but in yo"
iudgement¢ (who shalbe therefore accountable) defend themselues from
any assault¢ of the Indians: in w" regard, as also for theire better Civill
goverment (w* mutuall societie doth most conduce vnto) wee think it
fitt, that the houses and buildinge be so contrived together, as may make
if not hansome Townes, yet compact and orderly villages; that this is the
most proper, and succesfull maner of proceedinge in new Plantaéons,
12828314

besides those of former ages, the example of the Spaniards in the West
Indies, doth fully instance, and against it we do not conceiue there will
be any repugnancie, exept from shallow vnd'standinge that cast not
beyond the plsent; or from minds and affecéons, wholely intent to the
satisfieing of theire priv[ate] interests, although w the ruine of the
publique State.

The relinquishing of Charles Cittie, Henerico, the Iron Works, the Colledg
lande and Martins hundred, are thinge, not only of discontent, but of
evill fame, although we doubt not, vndeserved; the replanting them is of
absolute necessitie; lest the best fire that mantaines the acton here aliue
be putt out. for Martins hundred we leaue it to the Adventurers, to
take such expedient Course therein as themselues please, only the second-
ing thereof we most earnestly recomed vnto yo": but for the speedy
restoringe of the rest, we pray yo" to employ yo" vttermost endevo™;
and if the Colledge Tennte and those belonging to the Iron worke shall
not be sufficient (as we much doubt) to make those places good of them-
selues, we desire yo" to propound these two condiéons for the inviting of
private men, toa competent number to ioyne w them. first to sett downe
vppon the Companies Land, oceupieing and manuringe to theire owne
benefitt only, such quantitie thereof as they can manage; vntill such time
as they may go vppon their owne Dividente, when there shall by the
Companies Tennt€ and servante be a full recompence and sattisfacton
made them in kind, for y* clearing of ground, building of houses, and what
ever other cost or charge they haue bestowed vppon the Companies land,
and must then leaue vnto them. If this prevaile not (w" we chiefly wish)
then are we content to giue to every family ten acres of land, in those
places, w® yo" setting out, we will confirme to them and theire heires
for ever: and this ten acres shall not be acconnted in part of any other
proportéon due vnto them; nor be any impediment to hinder them from
goeing vppon theire Dividente when they please; condiéonally, that the
land be not left vneultivated é& the houses vninhabited.

The people remaining of the Iron works, we desire may be committed vnto
the charge of mt Maurice Barkley to be imployed (since we cannot hope
that the worke should go forward) in such maner as may be most bene-
ficiall to themselues, and vs, vntill such time as we may againe renue
that bussines, so many times vnfortunatly attempted, and yett so abso-
AUGUST 1, 1622 671

lute necessarie as we shall haue no quiett vntill we see it pfected: to w
purpose wee desire there may by the first oportunity be sent vs a pticular
list of the names and professions of the men, as also a noat of the tooles,
and materiall¢ wanting for the executing of the worke:

Of no lesse waight do we esteeme the Colledge affaires, w wee pray
yo" to take into yo" considerations not only as a publique, but a sacred
bussines; and in pticuler we very earnestly request the care, and paines
of m' George Sandys for the settling and ordering of the Teniite; who
beinge now by long experience growne skilfull in all maners of the Cuntrie,
we are informed it will not be lesse advantageable vnto vs, and of farr
more content to themselues, to be left to theire owne disposinge and gov-
erment, and to reduce the vncertaintie of halfe to the certaintie of a
Rent; w* we haue therefore agreed, shalbe for euty pson 20 bushelle of
Corne; 60' waight of good leafe tobacco, and one pound of Silke, to be
yearely paid, together w six dayes labo" in publique worke, and over
and aboue that they be bound to buildinge of convenient howses, plantinge
of orcharde, gardins &, on the Colledg Land and not elswhere: they that
will accept of these Conditons, yo" shall leaue to themselues, but so, as
for better conveniencie of living, fowr, or at least three of them, sorte
themselues to work, and liue together, and be bound each for other for
the true pformance of theire Coven*nte: those other that shall not be
willing or worthie of such agreement€, we leaue to yo" to take the best
order in disposinge of them: as for those that shalbe Artificers and of
Manuall trades and occupaéons, we conceiue that they may likewise
pforme this bargaine although they follow theire trades, w’ rather then
that they should not do, wee leaue it to yo" to contract otherwise wt
them, as yo" shall thinke best, allwaies reservinge that theire living be
vppon y*® Colledge Lande. As for the Brick-makers, we desire they may
be held to theire Contract made wt m' Thorpe, to the intent that when
opportunitie shalbe for the erecting of the fabricke of the Colledge, the
materialle be not wanting.

These are part of the remedies that are to be applied for the repaireinge
of this late disaster; as for the Acto™ thereof, wee cannot but wt* much
griefe proceed to the condempnation of theire bodies, the saving of whose
Soules, we haue so zealously affected: but since the mocent blood of so
672 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

many Christians, doth in iustice erie out for reveng, and yo" future securitie
in wisdome require; we must advise yo" to roote out from being any longer
a people, so cursed a nation, vngratefull to all benefitte, and vneapable
of all goodnesse: at least to the remoueall of them so farr from you, as
yo" may not only be out of danger, but out of feare of them, of whose
faith and good meaning yo" can never be secure: wherefore as they haue
merited let them haue a ppetuall warre w'"out peace or truce; and although
they haue desrved it wout mercie too, yet remembring who we are,
rather then what they haue been, we cannot but advise, not only the
sparing, but the preservation, of the younger people of both Sexes, whose
bodies may, by labo" and service become profitable, and theire minde
not overgrowne w' evill Customes, be reduced to civilitie, and after-
wardé to Christianitie: And because there is a necessitie not only in the
thing it self, but in the speedines of effecting it; we thinke it fitt that
besides that certaine way of famishing (wherevnto we doubt not but yo"
haue ere this given a good begining by the burning of theire Corne, or
the reaping it to yo’ owne benefitt) yo" add and putt in execution all
other waies and meanes of theire destructon; not omitting so much as to
provoke theire neighbouring enimies (by reward of bead¢€ and Copper
vppon the bringeing in of theire heade) to the fierce pursueing of them:
and that at such times especially as yo'selues may issue out vppon them
likewise; w° we think should be often don from all part¢ of the Collony
together: but for a full securinge of yo'selues, and a certaine destroyinge
of them, we conceiue no meanes so prop, nor expedient, as to mantaine
continually certaine bande of men of able bodies, and invred to the Cun-
trie; of stout mind@, and actiue handé, that may from time to time (in
severed bodies) pursue and follow them, surprisinge them in their habi-
tations, intercepting them in theire hunting, burninge theire Townes,
demolishing theire Temples, destroyinge theire Canoes, plucking vpp theire
weares, carying away theire Corne, and depriving them of whatsoeuer may
yeeld them sueco' or relief: by w°" meanes in a very short while, both yo"
iust revenge, and yo" ppetuall security might be certainly effected. As for
the mantainance of those men w' victualle and munition, we conceiue it
iust and equall, that it should be by a generall levy throughout the whole
Collony; in regard whereof, the one moyitie of the prise as well of the
psons of men for slaues, as good¢, should be vnto the Collony for fortifi-
caton and other publique vses; and the other Moytie devided amongst
AUGUST 1, 1622 673

the Souldiars themselues; in further sattisfacéon of whose travelle and
hazarde, we do purpose a liberall reeompence, out of the labo™ of those
yong people w® by his Ma" gratious favo" we hope to obtaine, out of the
severall Counties of this Kingdom w as it shall be bountifull to all so it
shalbe redoubled to them into whose handé the principalle either in execu-
gon or contriuement of this Treacherie shall fall: but if any ean take
Opachancano himself, he shall haue a great and singular reward from vs.
As for those Indians whom God vsed as instrument¢ of revealing and pre-
ventinge the totall ruine of yo" all we thinke a good respect and recom-
pence due vnto them, w*® be a good and carefull education of them may
best be expressed and sattisfied; whereby they may be made capable of
further benefitte and favo™.

Wee send yo" a Copie of o° Letters by the Furtherance w™ wee doubt not
but is safely long ere this arived wt yo" the suplies therein sent of Ship-
wrighte, and East India Schoole, wee cannot but againe most effectually
and earnestly recomend vnto yo" care and favo", w** phappe by the chaing
of thinge w'* yo" they will the more need. The improving of the Com-
panies revenues, and recoverie of theire Debteé is, of those thinge w'out
w*' neither wee nor yo" can subsist. Many other matters we haue to
write if time would giue leaue for want whereof, we must reserue them
till the departure of the Abigaile: And now comitting yo" and all yor

After o' very hartie Comendaéons. Wee had not thought to haue written
vnto yo" till wee had beene invited by yo' letters vnto vs: but the neces-
sitie of some thinge to be pformed by yo" hath made vs thinke it necessarie
to remember them in an extraordinarie maner, and to reinforce the
Instruccons and charge of the Counsell, by the advise and desires of vs
y®? Company.

The late calamities that haue befalne, do much grieue but no whit daunt
vs, for wee see no daunger but rather advantage to be made thereby, nor
any further daunger, except it be in yor feares, w°> would nowe be as vicious
as yo" former securitie, and as much betray yo" to cdestruecon: for vs yo"
may see the encrease of o' hopes and courage in the largnes of supplies
now sent by private men, since the publique is not able; vnto the con-
tinuance whereof we see such a disposition in mens mind@, as we cannot
but thinke, that the sheeding of this blood wilbe the Seed of the Planta-
tion, for the addiéon of price, hath much endeared the purchase.

And now to all the rest, we conceaue it a Sinne against the dead, to
abandon the enterprize, till we haue fully settled the possession, for w*?
so many of o° Brethren haue lost theire lives: this is the first thing due
from vs and yo"; and the next, w*" will likewise much further the other,
is a sharp revenge vppon the bloody misereanté, even to the measure that
they intended against vs, the rooting them out for being longer a people
vppon the face of the Earth. for the effecting whereof, as yo" haue already
receaved advise from the Counsell (w* we desire yo" in all pointe to follow)
so yo" shall now receave a gratious supplie from his most exellent Ma'*
of Armes and weapons fitt and prop for such service: the disposing of
them to psons and places we leaue to yo" iudgmente, but only for vse;
the proprietie must remaine to the generall Collony, as the begining of a
Publique Armorie, and a perpetuall testimony of his Ma‘ royall bountie
684 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

and favo": from w*" wee hope very speedily to obtaine the meanes of
restoring the Publique, rewarding the good desert of all, especially whose
worths shalbe shewed in these p'sent difficulties, and fully to furnish the
number of Tennt@, w in yo" the Governor, and other officers places,
we vnd'stand are wanting, not only to o” griefe, but wonder. But both
for the future and that w“ is past, rest assured we shall provide and make
sattisfactéon and had ear this donn in a very advantagable maner vnto
yo", insteed of Tennt€ sendinge yo" servanté, had not yor last letters dis-
claymed them, w*out such supply of Corne and victuall, as was impossible
for vs to provide, through o* povertie, and ite high price: wherfore the
hundred youths, w™ w'* 500! we had procured from the Cittie, wee were
constreined to giue vnto the Sumer Ileande Company to theire benefitt
and ot damage, and all through want of Corne: The abundant planting
and provision whereof, haueing been for these last foure yeares so continu-
ally vrged from vs, and yett as constantly neglected and and contemned,
giues iust cause to doubt, (and the more through the two strang propo-
sisions, w°" we heare of late haue beene made, of Ingrossinge all and
leavinge all:) that there hath been in some (in whom it ought least to
haue been) an intent to hinder the encrease of the Plantation further
then it might be theire owne gaine and greatnesse: a horrible Cryme, and
treason even against God himself, to whom this great work in o° intente
is principally consecrated; and yett such courses force vs allmost to such
suspicon: Neither shall we belieue otherwise of yo" S* Francis Wyatt and
the rest, in whom we yett haue great confidence, exept the Collony and
Plantation be from henceforth, by yo" courage, cares, and endeavo™ kept
and mantained, and every principall part thereof where formerly it was,
and that in abundance of grayne and victuall; w* since the Savadges
enmitie could not hinder in the Collonies weakest infancie, we cannot
thinke it can now do, when the strength thereof is almost ten times
doubled, exept we should thinke yo" lesse then they were: but we on the
contrary haue such confidence in yor vallo™ and wisdome, that we hope
to vnd'stand as suddaine an end of this warr, as it had an vnexpected
begininge, beinge pswaded theire owne terro™ will driue them away,
exept yo™ retaine them.

As for Enemies of equall conditon in Armes and vnd'standing, and more
mightier in power then yo" selues, we know none, and in God feare none;
OCTOBER 7, 1622 685

yett we thinke it yo" dutie to stand alwaies vppon yo" guard, and prepared
for defence as much as yo" may, the rest God will supplie if yo" serue him.
Abundance of Munition, w yor selues must take care that both the
Publique and Private, be allwaies well stored, w the exercising and
training vpp of the people in Martiall Discipline, and carefull preservation
of theire Armes, wherein there must neede haue been vnanswerable
neglect: if there be that want, yo" letters imply, are thing@ obvious that
we need not further touch: To those we desire yo" to take into yo" con-
sideration the continuall mantainance of good Shipping in the River;
w might easely be effected, if by raysinge of any Staple Comodities,
they might haue some part of fraight homeward¢ a little would suffice,
such is the danger and povertie of [26] all Marchaunte employmente, that
the certainty of verie smale gaine, would invite Shipping in abundance, of
all times in the yeare to transport people for Virginia, w°? would not only
serue by the accomodatinge of every mans occacons to further great
numbers: but also by a necessary engagement of those to whom the
Shipping belonge, cause many large Addventures to be made and much
people to be sent that otherwise would never go. We pray yo" seriously
therefore to endeavot it, and to take into yo" consideration what depend-
ance good thinge haue one vpon another and how a right and orderly
proceeding bring¢ all enterprises to pfeecon, seeing the following of Staple
Comodities doth not only tend to the conveniences of well living there,
and to the riches of them that raise them, but bringeth along w" it not
only the encrease of y° Plantation but also the defence and security thereof;
every Shipp being a Bullwark: and because by the same meanes, they that
meane yo" harme can only offend yo", we thought it necessarie aboue all
thinge, to secure the River from suddaine Invasion by Shipping: To w®™
purpose haveing fruitlesly attempted, allthough by the meanes of very
noble Parsonages, who were best able to effect itt, what hath in the name
of the Collony beene so often and importunatly requested, the sending of
Enginers, we haue gladly embraced the offer of Capt Each, concerning the
erecting of a Block house about Blunt Point, wherevnto we weare pswaded
and entreated by the advise and desires of almost all that knowe that
Cuntrie, aswell Planters, as Seamen, as a thing very feazable & of great
benefitt. wherevppon although the alteration of mens mynd@€ vppon the

first newes of the late Callamitie, and much more yo" grievous appre-
1282—33 45
686 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

hension of itt, brought it into consultation whether it were not impossible
to make those preparations and provision, that on o" part€ weare requisite
thereto, yett we resolved to go on w* of former deliberation, and haue
(though w* extreame diffieultie and hazard) by Gods blessing effected
whatsoever we intended. Now that yo" on yo" parte faile not to pforme
and accomplish the thing it self, we desire, entreat and even adiure yo";
for yo™ owne sakes, for o, for yo" safty, for yo" reputation, and for the
sattisfaton of all good mynde, who are in a longing expectation thereof:
If the difficulties proue greater then are here conceived, in the wrestling
w* them wilbe the tryall of yo" courages and in the over coming of them,
the encrease of yo" hono™. If the worke proue not of that consequence
as is p"tended yet it wilbe alwaies more worth then the labo" and cost,
that is thereto required, and y® remonstrance of yo" willingnes to pforme
what yo" can to yo" owne safety, will effectually moue and produce (wee
doubt not) the meanes to pforme fully what yo" desire: to speake plainly
we shall never belieue nor dare to attempt any thing of great engagement
and hazard, till by reall example of some extraordinarie worke by yo"
effected, we may haue proofe of the sinceritie of yo" intentons & assurance
not to be deluded and frustrated, as we haue hitherto beene in so great
and chargeable vnd'takinge. Performe in this, and yo" cannot further
require, what we will not vnd'take for yo" in this kind; if this of it selfe
proue not sufficient, w™" we well hope:

The Adventurers of Martins Hundred, haue very worthily made offer,
and ordered their officers that the fifte parte of theire hundred be from
time to time employed in this work till it may be pfected: Southampton
Hundred haue followed the example, and generally all privat Adventures
of vs that haue people in Virginia, very willingly agree to the like proporéon:
this tax wee haue here made, not to giue yo" thereby authority (w needed
not) but to giue a good example to the rest of the Collony, by taking more
of the burthen then proporéonable can be due vuto vs, chearfully to sup-
ply the rest of that shalbe needfull. This disposition of mynd¢, we assure
o'selues yo" shall find, if not, yo" must make it, and compell them to theire
owne good, that will not otherwyse vnd'stand it, but we hope there shalbe
no such oceaéon given, considering the merveilous forwardnes of the
Colony in this kind by many letters expressed: the remembrance whereof
bring@ to mynd the noble offer made by St George Yeardley, worthie
OCTOBER 7, 1622 687

the place he bore, to whom we must acknowledge the hono' of this propo-
sigons first moveing, and accordingly doubt not but in the furtherance of
y® execuGon of it, he will deserve both yo", and ot thanke in an especiall
maner. The Shipp and Mariners imployment as yo find in the Charter-
partie is to be discharged by a fraight of 800" and that to be raysed by
the lading aboard of 64000 waight of Tobacco at 3¢ p “ att w™ rate
besides the generall Companyes, it is agreed and ordered by the severall
societies, and the Adventures of Southampton hundred, the old Maga-
zine, and last yeares Joynt stock and that now sent, both consigned to
nm Ed: Blany, the Glasse, the ffurrs, the Mayde, the Shipwrights that their
Tobaceo shalbe laden aboard and sent home in the Abigaile, and if it
shalbe thought necessarie by the officers and facto", to send home any of
it before, that then there shalbe lefte in the hande of m*™ George Sandys
the Treasuror, the fifteenth pound of Tobacco (and more if that will not
sattisfie) toward¢ the makeing vpp of the 800" w* is to be paid the Shipp,
and for other necessarie vses of the Colony: vnto the same condiéons do
all private Adventurers [26] likewise agree, condiéonally vo" hold eeuaalt
the same course vppon all the Tobacco through the Land; w° wee hold
very equall and indeed necessarie to be don, if yo" cannot find better
meanes for the discharge of such payment, as the Company hath covenited
to Capt Each, wt being plainly expressed in the Charterparty sent yo",
we shall not need to repeat, but only to desire yo" especiall care, so to
order and dispose thinge, as we be not dishonored nor endamaged any
way, nor any thing lefte to vs here to pay: and likewise for sattisfacéon
and payment of the materiall¢ now sent for the erecting of the forte, w™*
haue alwaies been promised by the Colony to be sattisfied and repaid, and
now so much the more stricktly to be observed because they be adventuer
of diu's private men, who for the furtherance of this work, seeing the
Companies inabilitie haue made provision of the thinge and consigned
them to m' Blany, w'" order not to dispose of any of them, till the fforte
be served: this theire good mynde deserue yo" especiall care, that they
may be reimbursed of this charge.

And now we come to the returning of yo" Magazine and Adventures now
and formerly sent, w** we are extreamly solicitous, not so much for oF owne
Interesses (although they be great) as for yo", w be farr more: for vs
688 RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY

wee hope God will otherwise repay, if yo" do not, but for yo", wee cannot
conceaue, but that as yo" iustly deserue, yo" wilbe cleane leafte & aban-
doned from any supplies hereafter; and what danger that may be, yor
p'sent necessities speake, wt because they were not last yeare foreseene,
no regard was had of returning any thing nor beliefe; to the protestation,
w at o" request §desire§ the Counsell in theire letters by the Warwick
made, w** we cannot but remember to o” griefe, though to o' iustification:
lett the smart of sence now teach, what on the creditt of o* worde yo" would
not learne, that yo" gaines to yo" damage by thus gaining tyme, and that
the returning of o' Stocke home so much empaired, how eare it be pleasant
vnto yo" for a while, will in the end be more bitter vnto yo" then vs:
speedy and full returnes must be made, else it is impossible for vs to pro-
ceed on, not so much for o* vnwillingnes, as o° inabilities, o" Adventures
are greater, then we can now beare, much lesse increase. This scant
supplie w’? is now sent had been impossible to haue been raised, if either
the necessitie that required it, or the pawne that yo" offer had been lesse;
the preservation of the whole Colony, and the Revenues of the whole;
or if the securitie had been worse then the faith of yo" the Governor,
Treasuror, and Counsell, or the dilligence and importunity of them that
labo’ed it here, lesse then indefatigable, and such as would receiue no
nay, yo" had wanted even all, that yo" shall now God willing receaue.
Wee send yo" the Rolle to Subscription to giue yo" evidence hereof. The
multitude of Adventures, and maner of bringing in mony to all good
vnd'standing demonstrat¢, that thinge are at the bottome, exept the
currant be againe restored from Virginia. Wee haue no more in this
point to add, but that as we see it, the restles labo" of those that here
beare office, by procuring Adventures to supplie y° Colony so wee thinke
it should be yo", to provide that by profitable returnes, they may be
enabled and encouraged to continue it. The Companies great pouertie,
and many debt¢ keep@ vs infinitly perplexed, and the more because there
are dayly inevitable occaéons of expence & no ground or hope of Revenues
exept from Virginia: we therefore most earnestly intreat you, seriously to
endeavo’ the improvinge of the Companies Revenues there; and in
pticular that the debt@ due vppon the 50 youths sent in the Dutie, and
others, may be w*out faile recovered and sent home this yeare: wherein
we especially require the care and dilligence of m™ George Sandys whose
OCTOBER 7, 1622 689

charge it is; and haue acordingly ordered that there should be pticuler
Jnstrucéons given by the Auditors and Bookeeper in this point to w** we
referr.

Wee thinke it very fitt that yot send home by the Abigaile 60000 waight
of Sassafras, in regard she is to bring it fraight free, what shalbe made
thereof assure yo'selues, shall according to 0" promise be returned in
Armes, and Munition, or otherwise expended in fortificatéon, as yo'selues
shall desire: But we pray yo" in no sort to rely vppon that for the pay-
ment of Capt Each in any part, much lesse in whole, in regard the price
is so base, and the glutt so great, that it will not sell but at very long time,
and that for very litle.

There haue been many Petiéons putt vp vnto vs of greevances, for wronge
by vniust facto™ and ptners in Virginia, and of claymes to landeé, and
goodé, by the late death of frend¢: all w together w** o* desires vnd'
them: we haue ordered to be sent yo", and very earnestly request yo", to
see that iustice be fully and speedily pformed, and an accompt of all yo"
proceeding¢ endorsed vppon the backe of the PetiGons w™ all conveniencie
returned; that by the relief of the oppressed and helpinge of the poore
and needy, yo" may gaine favo" both wt* God and men.

The Adventurers of Martins hundred, haue now sett forth a verie charge-
able supply of people [27] for the reposessing of theire Plantation: the
thing is very pretious to vs, that vnd'stand the seasonablenes of it, and
see what an advantage of reputation the whole bussines of the Plantation
hath receaved by theire good example of courage and constancic, w*> is
more remarkable by the abundance of difficulties they haue overpast: we
canot but herein acknowledge a singular obligation of o'selues, and all
that loue the Plantation, vnto them; w if you do we desire yo" to expresse
it, by the furthering and assisting theire people and affaires, w all the
favo' and help, that yo" possibly may. And as this great body, so likewise
we think it 0’ duty to recommend vnto yo", all the pticuler Planters that
now come over; desiring yo" that the abundance of yo" loves and cares,
may be to the setling and disposing of them, as much as may be to theire
content; but certainly to theire safety and welfare.

S': This last night at 11. my Ladie Wyatt, wt manie other of hir frends
& train, took ship; as they were waighing anchor to be gone. The Secretarie
& his wife are also gone: who came hether so late, that they were in greate
likelihood to have been left behynd. ffor boisterous Captain Each would
not have stayed for anie.

But whereas at y” desire, & in manner by y" directed, I had caused two
Quarters of Seed wheat, in chaffe, & eares, to be provided & packed up
in 8 Barrells bored with holes for that purpose; & whereas y* had written
that the Captain should eall for them: he was so farr from that, that no
entreatie could prevaile to get him to take in anie one of the Barrells;
neither yet anie thing else in Barrells here provided for my brother George.
OCTOBER 18, 1622 691

Only a Rundlet of Sack sent to him from my wife, w" som other things of
small bulk; & a Seller of glasses w'" hote waters sent to him from my
Ladie Aucher, he yielded to take in. So that we pray y® very earnestly to
take sure order by y* Seaflower (to w Captain Each put us over, as
beeing to foloe him immediately;) that at their coming to the Downes
these things here may be called for. flor it is pittie they should be kept
from them & thence, to whom & whether great want would make them so
wellcome.

Though my house $have§ beein full in a manner all this last week, w®
my Ladie Wyatt & hir train, & other frends going to Virginia: yet have
I not neglected, (as far as the manners & regards of hospitalitie would
permitt me,) to perform my Duetie toward Virginia in generall, & toward
Southampton & Martins Hundred in particular, as farr as my advice,
requests, & persuasions, by woord, & writing, may prevaile.

Amongst other of my letters, I have caused a copie to be taken of two,
(w herew> T send y") because they may be of som use to the Companie,
if those points hereafter shall com in debate. The Copie of y°" remem-
brances (wt were exceeding good,) I sent & commended w great, earnest-
nes to my brother George: having set som marks of them w*' [ thought
most necessarie. I commended also y* pains in them to the Governo’.
But the Companies letters I only saw. They beeing shewed me to late to
read them.

My poore wife groweth still worse & weaker, beeing wasted w*‘" the often
fitts of hir tormenting pains. I dare not venter her up, w'out continuall
attendance of hir Peysitian: For whom I have now sent. So that this
week, if God send life y" may expect us.

I would my L. Treasuro™ might knowe, w what disease to my self I com
hasten up, to obey his pleasure.

ffor I come up in the tyme of receiving my Rents, & before I can get them.
I leve a multitude of woorkmen in all parts of my diz house, without
oversight, account, or direction. my yonger sons I am in preparing to
put out to schoole: but yet not deon. In sum I never took more pains
in my life, nor never shall leve things in greater confusion. But the tor-
ments & danger of my wife, exceedeth all other grief.

Yet seeing he summoneth me up so often & so earnestly, I will hasten
w'tall speed possible.

Y= last close of the desperate state of Virginia if I knew all, dooth trowble
me exceedingly. I pray y" desire M* Melling to write to me at large by
my footman; that I may meditate in the way what coorses to take.

Desire M' Carter to take order w'® M™* Bueket, that the little chamber
over against $§my wifes chamber, may be made clene, & ayred on Thursday
